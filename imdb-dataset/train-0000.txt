<START> this film was just brilliant casting location scenery story direction everyone's really suited the part they played and you could just imagine being there robert <UNK> is an amazing actor and now the same being director <UNK> father came from the same scottish island as myself so i loved the fact there was a real connection with this film the witty remarks throughout the film were great it was just brilliant so much that i bought the film as soon as it was released for <UNK> and would recommend it to everyone to watch and the fly fishing was amazing really cried at the end it was so sad and you know what they say if you cry at a film it must have been good and this definitely was also <UNK> to the two little boy's that played the <UNK> of norman and paul they were just brilliant children are often left out of the <UNK> list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for the whole film but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done don't you think the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone's life after all that was shared with us all
<START> big hair big boobs bad music and a giant safety pin these are the words to best describe this terrible movie i love cheesy horror movies and i've seen hundreds but this had got to be on of the worst ever made the plot is paper thin and ridiculous the acting is an abomination the script is completely laughable the best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer is it's just so damn terribly written the clothes are sickening and funny in equal <UNK> the hair is big lots of boobs <UNK> men wear those cut <UNK> shirts that show off their <UNK> sickening that men actually wore them and the music is just <UNK> trash that plays over and over again in almost every scene there is trashy music boobs and <UNK> taking away bodies and the gym still doesn't close for <UNK> all joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the 80's and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then
<START> this has to be one of the worst films of the 1990s when my friends i were watching this film being the target audience it was aimed at we just sat watched the first half an hour with our jaws touching the floor at how bad it really was the rest of the time everyone else in the theatre just started talking to each other leaving or generally crying into their popcorn that they actually paid money they had <UNK> working to watch this feeble excuse for a film it must have looked like a great idea on paper but on film it looks like no one in the film has a clue what is going on crap acting crap costumes i can't get across how <UNK> this is to watch save yourself an hour a bit of your life
<START> the <UNK> <UNK> at storytelling the traditional sort many years after the event i can still see in my <UNK> eye an elderly lady my friend's mother retelling the battle of <UNK> she makes the characters come alive her passion is that of an eye witness one to the events on the <UNK> heath a mile or so from where she lives br br of course it happened many years before she was born but you wouldn't guess from the way she tells it the same story is told in bars the length and <UNK> of scotland as i discussed it with a friend one night in <UNK> a local cut in to give his version the discussion continued to closing time br br stories passed down like this become part of our being who doesn't remember the stories our parents told us when we were children they become our invisible world and as we grow older they maybe still serve as inspiration or as an emotional <UNK> fact and fiction blend with <UNK> role models warning stories <UNK> magic and mystery br br my name is <UNK> like my grandfather and his grandfather before him our protagonist introduces himself to us and also introduces the story that stretches back through generations it produces stories within stories stories that evoke the <UNK> wonder of scotland its rugged mountains <UNK> in <UNK> the stuff of legend yet <UNK> is <UNK> in reality this is what gives it its special charm it has a rough beauty and authenticity <UNK> with some of the finest <UNK> singing you will ever hear br br <UNK> <UNK> visits his grandfather in hospital shortly before his death he burns with frustration part of him <UNK> to be in the twenty first century to hang out in <UNK> but he is raised on the western <UNK> among a <UNK> speaking community br br yet there is a deeper conflict within him he <UNK> to know the truth the truth behind his <UNK> ancient stories where does fiction end and he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parents br br he is pulled to make a last <UNK> journey to the <UNK> of one of <UNK> most <UNK> mountains can the truth be told or is it all in stories br br in this story about stories we <UNK> bloody battles <UNK> lovers the <UNK> of old and the sometimes more <UNK> <UNK> of accepted truth in doing so we each connect with <UNK> as he lives the story of his own life br br <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is probably the most honest <UNK> and genuinely beautiful film of scotland ever made like <UNK> i got slightly annoyed with the <UNK> of hanging stories on more stories but also like <UNK> i <UNK> this once i saw the <UNK> picture ' forget the box office <UNK> of braveheart and its like you might even <UNK> the <UNK> famous <UNK> of the wicker man to see a film that is true to scotland this one is probably unique if you maybe <UNK> on it deeply enough you might even re <UNK> the power of storytelling and the age old question of whether there are some truths that cannot be told but only experienced
<START> worst mistake of my life br br i picked this movie up at target for 5 because i figured hey it's sandler i can get some cheap laughs i was wrong completely wrong mid way through the film all three of my friends were asleep and i was still suffering worst plot worst script worst movie i have ever seen i wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour then i'd stop and you know why because it felt damn good upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the <UNK> and watched it burn and that felt better than anything else i've ever done it took american psycho army of darkness and kill bill just to get over that crap i hate you sandler for actually going through with this and ruining a whole day of my life
<START> begins better than it ends funny that the russian submarine crew <UNK> all other actors it's like those scenes where documentary shots br br spoiler part the message <UNK> was contrary to the whole story it just does not <UNK> br br
<START> lavish production values and solid performances in this straightforward adaption of jane <UNK> satirical classic about the marriage game within and between the classes in <UNK> 18th century england northam and paltrow are a <UNK> mixture as friends who must pass through <UNK> and lies to discover that they love each other good humor is a <UNK> virtue which goes a long way towards explaining the <UNK> of the aged source material which has been toned down a bit in its harsh <UNK> i liked the look of the film and how shots were set up and i thought it didn't rely too much on <UNK> of head shots like most other films of the 80s and 90s do very good results
<START> the <UNK> tells the story of the four hamilton siblings teenager francis <UNK> <UNK> twins <UNK> joseph <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> david samuel who is now the surrogate parent in charge the <UNK> move house a lot <UNK> is unsure why is unhappy with the way things are the fact that his brother's sister kidnap <UNK> murder people in the basement doesn't help relax or calm <UNK> nerves either francis <UNK> something just isn't right when he eventually finds out the truth things will never be the same again br br co written co produced directed by mitchell <UNK> phil <UNK> as the butcher brothers who's only other film director's credit so far is the april <UNK> day 2008 remake enough said this was one of the <UNK> to die <UNK> at the 2006 after dark <UNK> or whatever it's called in keeping with pretty much all the other's i've seen i thought the <UNK> was complete total utter crap i found the character's really poor very unlikable the slow moving story failed to capture my imagination or sustain my interest over it's 85 a half minute too long <UNK> minute duration the there's the awful twist at the end which had me laughing out loud there's this really big <UNK> build up to what's inside a <UNK> thing in the <UNK> basement it's eventually revealed to be a little boy with a teddy is that really supposed to scare us is that really supposed to shock us is that really something that is supposed to have us talking about it as the end credits roll is a harmless looking young boy the best <UNK> ending that the makers could come up with the boring plot <UNK> along it's never made clear where the <UNK> get all their money from to buy new houses since none of them seem to work except david in a <UNK> i doubt that pays much or why they haven't been caught before now the script tries to mix in every day drama with potent horror it just does a terrible job of combining the two to the extent that neither aspect is memorable or effective a really bad film that i am struggling to say anything good about br br despite being written directed by the extreme sounding butcher brothers there's no gore here there's a bit of blood splatter a few scenes of girls <UNK> up in a basement but nothing you couldn't do at home yourself with a bottle of <UNK> <UNK> a camcorder the film is neither scary since it's got a very middle class suburban setting there's zero atmosphere or mood there's a lesbian suggest incestuous kiss but the <UNK> is low on the exploitation scale there's not much here for the horror crowd br br filmed in <UNK> in california this has that modern low budget look about it it's not badly made but rather forgettable the acting by an unknown to me cast is nothing to write home about i can't say i ever felt anything for anyone br br the <UNK> commits the <UNK> sin of being both dull boring from which it never <UNK> add to that an ultra thin story no gore a rubbish ending character's who you don't give a toss about you have a film that did not impress me at all
<START> just got out and cannot believe what a brilliant documentary this is rarely do you walk out of a movie theater in such awe and <UNK> lately movies have become so over hyped that the thrill of discovering something truly special and unique rarely happens <UNK> <UNK> did this to me when it first came out and this movie is doing to me now i didn't know a thing about this before going into it and what a surprise if you hear the concept you might get the feeling that this is one of those <UNK> movies about an amazing triumph covered with over the top music and trying to have us fully convinced of what a great story it is telling but then not letting us in <UNK> this is not that movie the people tell the story this does such a good job of capturing every moment of their involvement while we enter their world and feel every second with them there is so much beyond the climb that makes everything they go through so much more tense touching the void was also a great doc about mountain climbing and showing the intensity in an engaging way but this film is much more of a human story i just saw it today but i will go and say that this is one of the best documentaries i have ever seen
<START> this movie has many problem associated with it that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school i have to give it credit on its <UNK> though many times throughout the movie i found myself laughing hysterically it was so bad at times that it was comical which made it a fun watch br br if you're looking for a low grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy <UNK> then pop a bowl of popcorn invite some friends over and have some fun br br i agree with other comments that the sound is very bad dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is kind of just there
<START> french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and <UNK> romance <UNK> on to the scene <UNK> <UNK> the revival just slightly but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made <UNK> was obviously shot on a low budget but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film and this in turn is <UNK> by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner the plot focuses on two main ideas prison and black magic the central character is a man named <UNK> sent to prison for fraud he is put in a cell with three others the quietly insane <UNK> body building <UNK> marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy after a short while in the cell together they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old <UNK> after <UNK> part of it they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls br br black magic is a very interesting topic and i'm actually quite surprised that there aren't more films based on it as there's so much scope for things to do with it it's fair to say that <UNK> makes the best of it's <UNK> as despite it's <UNK> the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout director eric <UNK> provides a great atmosphere for the film the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell <UNK> that the film feels very claustrophobic and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell it's very easy to get behind them it's often said that the unknown is the thing that really <UNK> people and this film proves that as the director <UNK> that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner and this helps to ensure that <UNK> actually does manage to be quite frightening the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done anyone worried that the film won't deliver by the end won't be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying overall <UNK> is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade highly recommended viewing
<START> when i rented this movie i had very low expectations but when i saw it i realized that the movie was less a lot less than what i expected the actors were bad the doctor's wife was one of the worst the story was so stupid it could work for a disney movie except for the murders but this one is not a comedy it is a laughable masterpiece of stupidity the title is well chosen except for one thing they could add stupid movie after dead husbands i give it 0 and a half out of 5
<START> i love cheesy horror flicks i don't care if the acting is sub par or whether the monsters look corny i liked this movie except for the <UNK> feeling all the way from the beginning of the film to the very end look i don't need a 10 page <UNK> or a sign with big letters explaining a plot to me but dark floors takes the what is this movie about thing to a whole new annoying level what is this movie about br br this isn't exceptionally scary or thrilling but if you have an hour and a half to kill and or you want to end up feeling frustrated and confused rent this winner
<START> anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined we have the <UNK> heroin addicted part time hooker wife with <UNK> all over her body <UNK> received from repeated <UNK> by an abusive son now she is <UNK> breast milk all over the kitchen floor the release so gained somehow akin to helen <UNK> placing her hands in running water we have the husband who starts out by <UNK> a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter she's upset with him because he came too quickly and ends by murdering his female colleague having sex with her corpse and then <UNK> her up we have the kid who is relentlessly <UNK> by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom you see it's all <UNK> deep huh the only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son's <UNK> it's a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be if that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this <UNK> is really serious no wonder most people think artists are insane we saw this lousy movie then put on zero woman the accused oh my god it was a <UNK> as to which one was worse what is going on in japan these days sick sick sick
<START> b movie at best sound effects are pretty good lame concept decent execution i suppose it's a rental br br you put some <UNK> oil in your mouth to save you from de poison <UNK> you cut de bite and suck out de <UNK> you gonna be ok tommy br br you stay by the <UNK> when agent harris calls you get me give me a fire <UNK> br br weapons we need weapons where's the <UNK> all we have is this <UNK> br br dr price is the snake expert br br local <UNK> can handle the occasional <UNK> alert every er in the <UNK> city area
<START> a total waste of time just throw in a few explosions non stop fighting exotic cars a deranged millionaire slow motion computer generated car crashes and last but not least a hugh <UNK> like character with wall to wall hot babes and mix in a <UNK> and you will have this sorry excuse for a movie i really got a laugh out of the dr evil like heavily <UNK> compound the plot was somewhere between preposterous and non existent how many <UNK> are willing to make a 25 million dollar bet on a car race answer 4 but didn't they become <UNK> through <UNK> responsibility this was written for <UNK> males it plays like a video game i did enjoy the <UNK> ii landing in the desert though
<START> laputa castle in the sky is the bomb the message is as strong as his newer works and more pure fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better the art is totally amazing and the soundtrack which is <UNK> many times after this im not sure if this was the first time i heard it and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack <UNK> the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy <UNK> is also a great role model he lives on his own the plot is classic miyazaki i won't give it away but the end is really great i rank this as one of miyazaki's three best with <UNK> and spirited away also you may want to check out <UNK> moving castle when it comes out sometime next year i hope if you like miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the usa enjoy <UNK> a
<START> at the height of the <UNK> big <UNK> racism row in 2007 involving <UNK> <UNK> and the late <UNK> <UNK> i condemned on an internet forum those <UNK> b b ' fans who praised the show after years of bashing <UNK> <UNK> sitcoms such as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i thought they were being <UNK> and said so <UNK> ain't half hot <UNK> was then thrown into the argument with some pointing out it had starred an english actor <UNK> up well yes but michael bates had lived in india as a boy and spoke <UNK> <UNK> the show's <UNK> overlook the reality he brought to his performance as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the noted indian character actor <UNK> <UNK> said in a 1995 documentary <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> that he was upset when he heard bates had landed the role but added no indian actor could have played that role as well as bates indeed br br <UNK> was perry and <UNK> companion show to <UNK> <UNK> also set in wartime the <UNK> english town of <UNK> on sea had been replaced by the hot steamy <UNK> of india in particularly a place called <UNK> where an army concert party puts on shows for the troops among them <UNK> <UNK> george <UNK> his first sitcom role since <UNK> in <UNK> camp <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> melvyn hayes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> graham john <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the late christopher mitchell <UNK> over this gang of <UNK> was the <UNK> sergeant major williams the brilliant <UNK> davies who regarded them all as <UNK> his frustration at not being able to lead his men up the jungle to engage the enemy in combat made him bitter and bullying though he was nice to <UNK> whom he thought was his <UNK> son then there was ever so english colonel reynolds donald <UNK> and <UNK> captain <UNK> michael <UNK> <UNK> was like a wise old <UNK> beginning each show by talking to the camera and closing them by <UNK> obscure <UNK> <UNK> he loved being <UNK> so much he came to regard himself as practically british his friends were the tea making <UNK> <UNK> the late <UNK> <UNK> who went on to <UNK> your <UNK> and the rope pulling <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so real indians featured in the show another point its <UNK> ignore <UNK> also provided what was described on the credits as <UNK> <UNK> similar to the <UNK> songs used as incidental music on <UNK> <UNK> each edition closed with him <UNK> <UNK> of hope <UNK> only to be <UNK> by a <UNK> up ' from williams the excellent opening theme was penned by jimmy perry and derek <UNK> br br though never quite <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> affections <UNK> nevertheless was popular enough to run for a total of eight seasons in 1975 davies and <UNK> topped the <UNK> with a cover version of that old <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they then recorded an entire album of old <UNK> entitled what else <UNK> <UNK> ' br br the show hit crisis point three years later when bates died of cancer rather than <UNK> the role of <UNK> the writers just let him be quietly forgotten when george <UNK> left the character of <UNK> took his place as <UNK> providing another source of comedy br br the last edition in 1981 saw the soldiers leave india by boat for <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> watching them go with great sadness as did viewers br br repeats have been few and far between mainly on u k gold all because of its so called <UNK> reputation this is strange for one thing the show was not specifically about racism if a white man <UNK> up is so wrong why does david <UNK> 1984 film 'a passage to <UNK> still get shown on television it featured alec guinness as an indian and won two oscars it was derived from jimmy <UNK> own experiences some characters were based on real people the sergeant major really did refer to his men as <UNK> i take the view that if you are going to put history on television get it right <UNK> the past no matter how <UNK> it might seem to modern audiences is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was both funny and truthful and viewers saw this thank heavens for d v d 's i say time to stop this review as williams would say i'll have no <UNK> in this jungle
<START> i have only had the luxury of seeing this movie once when i was rather young so much of the movie is <UNK> in trying to remember it however i can say it was not as funny as a movie called killer tomatoes should have been and the most memorable things from this movie are the song and the scene with the elderly couple talking about poor timmy other than that the movie is really just scenes of little tomatoes and big tomatoes rolling around and people acting scared and overacting as people should do in a movie of this type however just having a very silly premise and a catchy theme song do not a good comedy make granted this movie is supposed to be a b movie nothing to be taken seriously however you should still make jokes that are funny and not try to <UNK> a mildly amusing premise into a full <UNK> movie perhaps a short would have been fine as the trailer showing the elderly couple mentioned above and a man desperately trying to gun down a larger <UNK> was actually pretty good the trailer itself looked like a mock trailer but no they indeed made a full movie and a rather weak one at that
<START> chances are is a charming romantic fantasy about a woman <UNK> shepherd whose husband christopher <UNK> is killed shortly after learning she is pregnant we then see the husband in heaven letting the powers that be know that he was taken too soon and that his wife needs him he is told he can return to earth but not as himself <UNK> 19 years where we see <UNK> daughter mary stuart masterson preparing to graduate from college and <UNK> a young man robert downey jr who it turns out is the reincarnation of her father the film is a little on the predictable side the story goes all the places you expect it to but it is so <UNK> played by an energetic cast especially shepherd and downey that you can't help but get wrapped up in the fun shepherd has rarely been seen on screen to better advantage and she and downey are backed by a talented group of character actors in supporting roles a lovely and charming fantasy that will <UNK> and <UNK> you
<START> shown in australia as <UNK> this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become <UNK> and have to watch it to the end just to see if it could get any worse and it does the storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school <UNK> class the sets are pathetic but <UNK> better than the <UNK> and the acting is wooden br br the <UNK> <UNK> seems to have been stolen from the props <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> there didn't seem to be a single original idea in the whole movie br br i found this movie to be so bad that i laughed most of the way through br br malcolm mcdowell should hang his head in shame he obviously needed the money
<START> despite some occasionally original touches like the virtual sets that provide the background for the victorian interiors featuring <UNK> <UNK> and her circle this film falls short and ultimately disappoints newcomer <UNK> <UNK> seems talented but is wasted as emmy a character who by mid film is reduced to nothing more than staring at a <UNK> watching lady <UNK> <UNK> an autobiography <UNK> <UNK> takes off briefly when lady <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> appears the camera <UNK> on her facial expressions mannerisms even making her appear to be <UNK> or <UNK> invisible <UNK> into scenes to <UNK> <UNK> virtual rendering of her br br a straightforward biopic of <UNK> <UNK> would have been worthwhile but this film unfortunately makes a <UNK> of both lady <UNK> life and that of a modern day computer scientist and her <UNK> drawn <UNK> boyfriend
<START> i hate reading reviews that say something like <UNK> waste your time this film stinks on ice ' it does to that reviewer yet for me it may have some sort of <UNK> charm if you like the other <UNK> series films this one will be watchable if you like 40s <UNK> films this one will be watchable br br this film is not as good in my opinion as any of the earlier series entries which starred richard <UNK> as the protagonist it's much slower and the plot is trite you've seen this same narrative device used in many other films and usually better br br but the acting is good and so is the lighting and the dialog it's just lacking in energy and you'll likely figure out exactly what's going on and how it's all going to come out in the end not more than a quarter of the way through br br the <UNK> series is semi noir and there character mood lighting camera movement and angles are more important than the story itself but this film is not noir it's too light weight and hollywood innocent for that neither richard <UNK> character nor those of any of his ladies in the previous films had to come to a good end you just never knew until the end br br but still i'll recommend this one for at least a single viewing i've watched it at least twice myself and got a reasonable amount of enjoyment out of it both times
<START> the problems with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> e <UNK> are many a one line concept that looks good on paper which also worked in an earlier english film love actually goes terribly wrong thanks to inept and shallow writing a well <UNK> idea gets crushed to <UNK> under the weight of its own <UNK> ambition a director so completely <UNK> by his own much <UNK> first film goes overboard with the devices that worked in his earlier film <UNK> ho <UNK> ho try counting the number of times the device of split screens is used in this flick the problem is what worked <UNK> in <UNK> ho <UNK> ho were the emotional <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> school of film making but here <UNK> doesn't quite grace us with its appearance on the screen no not even <UNK> the writer director gives us <UNK> relationships with one common problem <UNK> but where is the intensity where is the depth where is the <UNK> a <UNK> to <UNK> sans emotion and one that goes on and on and on <UNK> it just cannot work br br in my opinion the basic <UNK> for a <UNK> film like this to work is that not only should each individual story be <UNK> it should in some way or the other follow the <UNK> of the traditional three act structure screen writing guru <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that's the real reason why <UNK> e <UNK> didn't work for me none of the stories had any depth or a roller coaster ride of emotional ups and downs one expects in mainstream hindi cinema also the <UNK> between some of the stories seemed <UNK> and very forced it's not clear what salman khan is doing at <UNK> <UNK> wedding if he was required to be present at the wedding scene for a neat wrap up why not <UNK> a few more <UNK> and bring the other two couples also to the wedding that would be <UNK> br br but yes some of the stories did have a lot of promise for one the anil kapoor <UNK> <UNK> story tries to address a very real situation mid life crisis but its journey is so linear that you're left wondering if it was really an issue similarly the problem of commitment in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> story is also true to life if only it was developed a little better i felt that the more promising stories in this <UNK> mash were told from the male point of view which is fine but it brings down the emotional <UNK> of these stories because the female characters <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in particular have all the depth of a half filled bath <UNK> wasn't this film supposed to be about <UNK> different <UNK> now the actors john abraham still needs to learn acting while <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> and endearing as ever anil kapoor gets a role written just for him but sometimes <UNK> the boredom of his character since she didn't get a <UNK> character to portray <UNK> <UNK> uses her charming smile and natural acting style to cover up for it <UNK> <UNK> is fine despite going a <UNK> over the top in a few scenes <UNK> <UNK> has nothing much to do but she does remind us that she's the same girl who surprised us with her <UNK> performance in <UNK> govinda tries to make up for that huge mistake called <UNK> <UNK> and succeeds to a large extent br br that brings me the most irritating track of the film which <UNK> ends up <UNK> the maximum screen time salman khan and <UNK> <UNK> the track is irritating mainly because of them but i must credit them for their <UNK> they're consistently bad all through the film <UNK> could well be the next queen of <UNK> i don't buy the crap that her role that of an <UNK> <UNK> required her to act over the top somebody should tell her the difference between being flamboyant because the character demands it and downright <UNK> if you've seen <UNK> <UNK> who seems to be the inspiration behind this role in her interviews and <UNK> boss you'll know what i mean i strongly feel that if <UNK> <UNK> had taken <UNK> <UNK> in this role rather than a bigger star like <UNK> the story would have worked better salman <UNK> phony accent is well shannon <UNK> hindi is less <UNK> than <UNK> br br to be fair to the director he does manage to add some good directorial touches to the film i particularly liked the use of grey as the <UNK> color in the anil kapoor <UNK> <UNK> story as a metaphor for their boring existence and the bright colors that come into the story with the arrival of the other woman but will anyone choose to paint their house in varying depressing shades of grey that's acceptable cinematic license i would say but when the film runs almost for 4 hours it almost feels like the director is trying too hard to give the audience a glimpse of his <UNK> in an endlessly meandering montage of uninspiring sequences br br maybe <UNK> <UNK> wants us to sit in the theatre for as long as is <UNK> possible <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ho <UNK> ho
<START> the original demille movie was made in 1938 with <UNK> march a very good film indeed hollywood's love of remakes brings us a fairly interesting movie starring <UNK> <UNK> he of course was brilliant as he almost always seemed to be in all of his movies charlton heston as andrew jackson was a stroke of genius however the movie did tend to get a little long in places it does not move at the pace of the 1938 version still it is a fun movie that should be seen at least once
<START> this is a very light headed comedy about a wonderful family that has a son called pecker because he use to peck at his food pecker loves to take all kinds of pictures of the people in a small <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and manages to get the attention of a group of photo art lovers from new york city pecker has a cute sister who goes simply nuts over sugar and is actually an addict taking <UNK> of sugar from a bag there are scenes of men showing off the <UNK> in their <UNK> with <UNK> movements and <UNK> doing pretty much the same it is rather hard to keep your mind out of the <UNK> with this film but who cares it is only a film to give you a few laughs at a simple picture made in 1998
<START> the dvd version consists of 2 episodes the <UNK> of <UNK> being the <UNK> in addition the language was spanish without subtitles hence it's hard for me to review in depth this movie because because i didn't understand what was said br br <UNK> being an historic icon the part is very difficult and i found that for a newcomer <UNK> <UNK> just plays fine she is strong <UNK> but also a very supportive tender soul mate <UNK> dalton as <UNK> is perfect and their romance is the main thing of the first episode so it is not really a documentary nor a <UNK> but a great love story br br after the <UNK> a new lover comes marc <UNK> but the flavor is gone we remember always our first love so i found the second episode dull and their tragic fate isn't told <UNK> br br nonetheless the production is <UNK> the sets are big <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> live location exotic and the <UNK> splendid the producers have a lot of money for sure but they spend nothing on the special effects they are so poor blue screens ships <UNK> that it's funny br br finally i would like very much to hear it in french or english to make a definitive opinion about this two movies
<START> we had to go to an <UNK> so we turned on the <UNK> to record the ending after it was over i looked at my husband and said do you have a clue he <UNK> his head no i said so you made me watch the end of this movie and i have no clue what just happened he didn't make me but you know br br the movie body itself was quite good there was a lot of suspense it kept you wondering then came the ending the ending was well it just ended you weren't let in on what happened or why right up until the credits i kept thinking something would happen to explain it but it never did so i came here expecting someone figured it out and i just wasn't paying attention nope here four years later i'm just as clueless as tom <UNK> was br br i still have no clue what went on i'm just glad i didn't waste any to buy it because i sure would have been mad br br <UNK> i get it the end of the movie is what disappeared <UNK>
<START> bela lugosi appeared in several of these low budget <UNK> for <UNK> studios in the 1940's and the corpse <UNK> is one of the better ones br br bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then <UNK> fluid from their bodies so he can keep his <UNK> wife looking young after a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the <UNK> deaths the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards br br you have got almost everything in this movie the <UNK> <UNK> consist of an old <UNK> a <UNK> and dwarf her sons a <UNK> and spooky <UNK> in <UNK> house bela and his wife find they sleep better in <UNK> rather than <UNK> in the movie br br the corpse <UNK> is worth a look especially for bela lugosi fans great fun br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> i have read the book a couple of times and this movie doesn't follow exactly as it should i could let this slide it is after all a movie however i have serious issues with the setting of the movie nobody has seemed to mention that this movie and the book it is based on are based in actual events that happened in <UNK> i live in <UNK> i grew up in the town that this movie is supposed to be based on first of all the small town that is talked about as the setting is the third largest city in the state with a population of around 50 000 grand island is the largest city between lincoln and denver second the scenery for the movie is wrong grand island is in the <UNK> river valley which is very flat with very few trees i tried watching this movie but it made me mad to see my hometown being treated so bad this was a real event large sections of the city were wiped out in the book they talk about riding <UNK> from mormon island to <UNK> park i guess you could if you don't mind a 15 mile ride each way for anyone who wants to know what really happened go here http www <UNK> com <UNK>
<START> i caught this at a test screening all i can say is what the hell this movie plays out about as smoothly as mickey mouse reading the script for scarface it's bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense and even if you do leave your brain in the car the film is still so bizarre that it isn't even funny br br the plot involves crocodile hunter steve irwin trying to save a crocodile which contains a cia <UNK> the cia comes after irwin to get their <UNK> back irwin mistakes them for <UNK> and sets out to stop them br br that's about all the story there is the rest is over the top <UNK> of australian culture <UNK> see <UNK> and <UNK> and strangely choreographed action sequences at one point irwin <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> and knife fights with a cia agent on top of it yes that's right steve irwin knife fights a guy on top of an <UNK> let that be your guide for this ridiculously bad film
<START> a strong woman oriented subject after long director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the power the <UNK> version of the hollywood hit not without my daughter is actress <UNK> first home production a story about a woman's fight against harsh injustice br br the story of the film revolves around <UNK> <UNK> kapoor who lives in canada with her two <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there she meets <UNK> <UNK> kapoor falls in love with him and they soon marry their family is complete when <UNK> has a boy <UNK> master <UNK> <UNK> but their happiness is short lived as the news of <UNK> <UNK> mother <UNK> naval makes them leave their perfect life in canada and come to india and that's when the problems start from the moment they reach br br india both are shocked to see the <UNK> and the vast <UNK> of people everywhere they take a crowded train to reach <UNK> village and when they finally reach the station they have to catch a long bus drive to his village the filthy <UNK> bus combined with the uncertain <UNK> makes it a never ending drive and unfortunately for them a <UNK> mob that beat <UNK> out of shape for no fault of his attacks their bus fortunately they get shot dead just in time before they can further harm him after that they drive to the <UNK> <UNK> where <UNK> father <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lives with his wife <UNK> naval <UNK> realized that her father in law is in command as soon as she enters the place but her only <UNK> is her mother in <UNK> warm welcome br br living there <UNK> learns of her father in laws <UNK> behavior and realizes that ruthless killing is a way of life for him the day she sees her father in law teach her son to throw a bomb she loses it and <UNK> out against him <UNK> to <UNK> that they move back to canada but terror strikes again when <UNK> is murdered one day leaving a broken down <UNK> alone with her son in this strange land where she is <UNK> by a cruel father in law her fight against this man to save her son is what makes up the climax of this emotional heart wrenching film br br what sets apart <UNK> from most films being made off late is also the rural setting of the movie the only <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> music which fails to rise above the script the only saving grace is the sexy item number <UNK> <UNK> which has been composed by <UNK> <UNK> another pat for the director comes because he has <UNK> some splendid performances from his cast <UNK> kapoor is the life of the film and has given a moving performance as a helpless mother she is sure to win awards for this <UNK> portrayal second is actor <UNK> <UNK> who is back with a bang with this film his <UNK> mannerisms suit him to the <UNK> and he's shown his <UNK> once again with this role <UNK> kapoor is the surprise <UNK> of the film with a sincere and effective portrayal that stands up against both the other actors <UNK> naval too is in top form and her <UNK> climax showdown with <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> cameo provides the lighter moments and surely he's been pulled in to get the required star value though his role was not really required he's done it well overall <UNK> is a far superior film than most <UNK> out these days and the <UNK> release hype is sure to get it a good opening <UNK> is sure to get the critics and audience <UNK> up so what if the film needs to be desperately <UNK> by at least 2 <UNK> to better the impact <UNK> still has the power to go on without a <UNK>
<START> the first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama i love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters explaining just enough to stay excited of course this show has some flaws in the first two series there are some characters who for some reason don't show up in the third season many of the characters have a decent sent off but some of them just aren't there like rose and her husband where the hell are they what happened to them maybe they will return in later episodes but it is a little inconsistent that being said lost manages to be thrilling every episode especially the first two seasons that is a very hard thing to do i do notice that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mystery aspects of the show this is not a bad thing it even saves some episodes from getting boring one of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters you will grow to love these characters good or bad but eventually i will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure the danger of lost getting canceled due to <UNK> ratings is near and that would be devastating
<START> i don't know what it is i find so endearing about this film but the first time i saw it i wanted to see how it ended i'm not a big fan of paul <UNK> nor of war dramas but i was truly wondering just how and when <UNK> would find his child all he knows is that the boy has green eyes truth be told i have not seen this movie in years nor has it been shown on tv in a while but this movie is somewhat of one man's odyssey after the pains of war <UNK> shows a very sympathetic and heart warming portrayal of a man lost by his memories there is an underlying message in this movie that he is looking for the last shred of human morality in the aftermath of this war and the reality that he does confront why this movie is not yet on dvd or video is a mystery to me
<START> many have stated that <UNK>  killer whale is a jaws rip off this is not really true though the enormous commercial success of jaws undoubtedly made these man vs beast stories more attractive <UNK> for film makers in the second half of the '70s <UNK>  killer whale would be better described as a modern day <UNK> of <UNK> dick it's a story about obsession on one hand a <UNK> obsessive quest to avenge the death of its mate on the other a bounty <UNK> obsessive quest to kill the whale before it can claim any more lives sadly <UNK> killer whale emerges a very disappointing film its <UNK> interesting ideas somewhat ruined by hammy performances and preposterous plotting br br shark hunter nolan richard harris encounters a marine life <UNK> rachel <UNK> charlotte <UNK> diving off the atlantic coast of canada their meeting almost ends in disaster when <UNK> team are attacked by a great white shark but a killer whale arrives in the nick of time to stop the shark after this nolan becomes increasingly obsessed with capturing a killer whale and selling it to an <UNK> but his plans <UNK> when he accidentally kills a pregnant female of the species while the <UNK> male looks on rachel tells nolan that a killer whale is an incredibly intelligent <UNK> with a strong memory and feelings just like a human worse still native <UNK> will <UNK> warns him that the whale will always remember its grief and do everything it can to have revenge nolan initially tries to forget about the whole <UNK> incident but the whale causes havoc in the fishing town and the disgruntled locals begin to demand that nolan puts to sea to track it down and destroy it eventually nolan is forced to pursue the killer <UNK> the hunt leads all the way to the desolate ice <UNK> of the <UNK> ocean where man and beast play out their final fatal battle against each other br br two things stand out in this film one is the haunting score by <UNK> <UNK> perhaps the greatest composer of film music of all time his talents wasted on various <UNK> rate <UNK> during the 70s and 80s the other is the amazing widescreen photography of ted moore which makes the film consistently pleasing to the eye in every other department <UNK>  killer whale is a shoddy film that does nothing to enhance the reputation of its talented cast and crew harris appears extremely ill throughout the film his hair <UNK> black rings around his eyes and skin <UNK> pale his performance lacks the usual <UNK> <UNK> strikes a lot of sexy poses but fails to convince with her long <UNK> and ill informed explanations about the ways of <UNK> the rest of the actors are wasted in brief and undeveloped roles the most memorable of which sees bo derek getting her leg bitten off by the vengeful whale the plot is total nonsense from start to finish with such preposterous sequences as the whale deliberately starting a fire in the fishing village that <UNK> and destroys the local <UNK> although it's credible to suppose that <UNK> are intelligent creatures with genuine emotions the idea that a whale could plot revenge against a single human <UNK> and carry it out so <UNK> is utterly absurd <UNK>  killer whale is really one for <UNK> of the man vs beast cycle from the late 70s most will come away from the film shaking their heads in disbelief and <UNK> their teeth with despair
<START> detective tony rome frank sinatra returns to the screen after his self titled debut this time it's a film that's played for <UNK> while on a diving trip rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea her feet as you might expect <UNK> in <UNK> rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain <UNK> <UNK> rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone the <UNK> sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the <UNK> <UNK> welch but he fails miserably in this ham <UNK> vanity project the frankly laughable denouement that <UNK> every female is quite astounding every woman in the film is a <UNK> head who likes <UNK> over is front of the camera director douglas of course <UNK> in <UNK> in on the cracks of their <UNK> each time as they <UNK> their <UNK> <UNK> there's even a ridiculously campy gay character that <UNK> belief this was a film made by real men for real men to <UNK> their own <UNK> sexuality it's a shameful <UNK>
<START> sorry i just didn't find the subject matter as compelling as the filmmaker did the robot guy and the mole rat guy were pretty interesting although morris didn't really tell us much about them the other two subjects were a bore and the supposed connections between them didn't hold up
<START> on 24 october 1955 the hard work <UNK> of the hadley oil company mitch wayne rock hudson meets the executive secretary lucy moore lauren bacall in the office of her boss bill ryan in new york and invites her to go to a <UNK> with the alcoholic playboy and son of a <UNK> kyle hadley robert stack on the way of the meeting he <UNK> that they had traveled from <UNK> to new york to satisfy the wish of the reckless kyle who is his best friend since their childhood of eating a <UNK> from club 21 and the meeting was just a <UNK> to <UNK> father <UNK> hadley robert keith mitch and kyle immediately fall in love for lucy and kyle <UNK> uses his money to impress lucy then he opens his heart and <UNK> lucy they get married and travel to <UNK> and the insecure kyle stops drinking meanwhile <UNK> sister <UNK> dorothy malone is an easy woman and has a non <UNK> crush on mitch that sees her as a sister one year later kyle discovers that he has a problem and might be <UNK> and starts drinking again the jealous <UNK> <UNK> kyle telling that his wife and mitch are having a love affair when lucy finds that she is pregnant kyle believes that the baby belongs to mitch and his <UNK> leads to a tragedy br br written on the wind is an overrated melodramatic soap opera with artificial characters and situations there are at least two great movies with characters with drinking problem the lost weekend 1945 with stunning performance of ray <UNK> and days of wine and <UNK> <UNK> with awesome performance of jack lemmon robert stack has a reasonable performance and his character's motives for drinking are shallow and clichés in the end the forgettable written on the wind is entertaining only and never a feature to be nominated to the oscar my vote is seven br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> words in the wind
<START> as with many other pop culture franchise series this line just didn't know when to quit instead of leaving things as they were perfectly ended they went on to generate this the first installment of this franchise to fall sorely short of the mark br br this movie should never have happened it was not intended for there to have been a fourth movie in this line and it sure shows the premise is idiotic and the portrayals were the same br br after the wonderful experience which was the omen this was a major disappointment which <UNK> of 70's cheese and horrible acting it was reminiscent of the <UNK> horror in those aspects and left a terrible lingering <UNK> long after it was over br br it rates a 1 4 10 from br br the fiend
<START> this so called remake is terrible i went to see this tonight on the first day as the anticipation and hype was too much for me to handle but within the first half an hour we knew that this is a disaster it not only does not match the hype created but also insults the original blockbuster the script had <UNK> the editing was <UNK> quite a few times <UNK> who is an excellent actor did an okay job amitabh was alright the director wanted to portray how evil his character is but he went a bit overboard which resulted in it being <UNK> ajay who is especially smooth in these kind of roles was also a disappointment lets not even get started about the new guy <UNK> one wouldn't be proud to start off a career with something like this <UNK> <UNK> who was thrown in for a few laughs couldn't even get a smile out of anyone because of his <UNK> humor and the shrill voice <UNK> <UNK> proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today all in all <UNK> who i thought was one of the most talented and gifted directors india has had failed miserably he took up such a huge challenge and responsibility to remake what is known as the best hindi movie ever and made a mess out of it
<START> this was the third muppet movie and the last one jim <UNK> was around to take part in the making of before his <UNK> death in 1990 the first three films starring the famous characters were all made and released into theatres before i was born i originally saw the first and second <UNK> in the original trilogy the muppet movie and the great muppet caper around the mid nineties as a kid but didn't see this third one the muppets take manhattan until april 2007 this was shortly after i had seen its two predecessors and <UNK> muppet treasure island for the first time in many years this third muppet movie definitely didn't disappoint me the first time i saw it and my second viewing nearly three years later may not have impressed me as much but if not it certainly didn't go too far downhill br br the <UNK> stage musical manhattan <UNK> turns out to be a big hit on their college campus they are <UNK> from college so they will soon be leaving but decide they will all stay together and go to manhattan to try and get their show on broadway after their arrival they begin searching for a producer but after many <UNK> they finally decide to part and go find jobs most of them leave town but <UNK> stays and is still determined to find the right producer and reunite the muppet gang he gets a job at a new york restaurant owned by a man named pete the frog quickly befriends <UNK> daughter jenny an aspiring fashion designer who currently works at her father's restaurant as a waitress as <UNK> continues his attempts to reach stardom now with the help of jenny he doesn't know that miss <UNK> has secretly stayed in new york and is now <UNK> on him she begins to see <UNK> and jenny together and to her it looks like they're getting close which leads to jealousy br br when i saw this movie for the second time it looked disappointing at first it seemed a little rushed <UNK> and maybe even forgettable around the beginning there are some funny bits during this part of the film such as animal chasing a woman through the audience on the college campus but for a little while the film seemed bland to me compared to its two predecessors fortunately it wasn't long before that changed the film is entertaining for the most part with saying goodbye the poignant song the muppets sing as they part and a lot that happens after that the two funniest parts might be miss <UNK> <UNK> after she sees <UNK> and jenny <UNK> but there were definitely many other times when i laughed such as poor <UNK> trying to <UNK> with other bears the muppets still have their charm and comical antics which obviously also helps carry the movie for the most part as does the plot a simple but intriguing one for all ages there are some weaker moments such as the muppet babies sequence and <UNK> <UNK> performance as jenny is <UNK> but neither of these problems are too significant and are far from enough to ruin the entire experience br br i would say the muppet movie the film that started the franchise in 1979 is the best of the original trilogy and that seems to be the most popular opinion this third film is probably the weakest of the three but all of them are good unlike muppets from space the third of the theatrical films in the franchise made after <UNK> sad passing at least the muppets take manhattan is still the muppets i won't go into details about what i think of the <UNK> 1999 film released twenty years after their first one since i've already explained in my review of it why i found it so disappointing and even though it does have some appeal i'm clearly not alone however every theatrical movie starring the lovable muppets that was made during <UNK> life is good entertainment for the whole family even if the second and third installment each showed a slight decline in quality after the one that directly <UNK> it
<START> this film was on late at night when i saw it it was interesting at start but it didn't convince me as a whole i am no <UNK> fan in fact i don't like boxing at all it's <UNK> obscene and double faced by society that some get money for beating each other up br br nevertheless i felt the start of the film was ok actors alright especially george c scott as <UNK> <UNK> i don't know how reliable the flick is i haven't read books and books about boxing or <UNK> i don't know anything about the man but it was quite entertaining br br as the movie went on i felt it lost a little of it's charm and i also lost interest i managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough
<START> warning this review contains spoilers do not read if you don't want some points revealed to you before you watch the film br br with a cast like this you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into did they see the script and say hey close encounters of the third kind was such a hit that this one can't fail ' unfortunately it does did they even think to check on the director's <UNK> i mean would you do a movie with the director of a movie called <UNK> <UNK> ' <UNK> clark who would later go on to direct the infamous final justice ' made this it makes you wonder how the people of mystery science theater 3000 could hammer final <UNK> and completely miss out on the return ' br br the film is set in a small town in new mexico a little boy and girl are in the street <UNK> one night when a powerful <UNK> <UNK> er a spaceship appears and <UNK> over them in probably the worst special effect sequence of the film the ship <UNK> some kind of red <UNK> on them it looked like clark had held a <UNK> of water in from of the camera lens and <UNK> his <UNK> pen in it so right away you are treated with cheese anyhow the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children elsewhere we see vincent <UNK> whom i find to be a terrific actor watch his scenes in <UNK> for proof as they are outstanding who is playing a <UNK> or as i called him the <UNK> <UNK> he steps out of the cave he is in and he and his dog are <UNK> by the ship twenty five years go by and the girl has grown up to be <UNK> shepherd who works with her father raymond <UNK> in studying unusual weather <UNK> or something like that shepherd spots some strange <UNK> in satellite pictures over that little new mexico town and she travels there to research it once she gets there the local <UNK> <UNK> her and blame her for the recent slew of cattle <UNK> that have been going on and deputy jan michael vincent comes to her rescue from this point on the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other especially after vincent <UNK> off the locals and informs shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty five years earlier while this boring mess is happening vincent <UNK> with his killer dog at his side is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item you know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trick or <UNK> at halloween the kind that you shake to make them glow <UNK> uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn <UNK> in people it's the second worst effect in the movie every time <UNK> is on screen with the glow stick the <UNK> atmosphere suddenly turns dark like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that <UNK> it ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is br br and what does all this lead up to it's hard to tell when the final confusing scene arrives see <UNK> and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that shepherd found as some kind of calling card ' but none of it makes sense why do shepherd and vincent age and <UNK> does not <UNK> explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants shepherd dead but even that doesn't make much sense when you really think about it i mean why doesn't he kill jan michael vincent after all he had twenty five years to do it and the aliens won't need him if shepherd is dead anyhow so why try to kill her speaking of the aliens it is never clear what they really wanted out of shepherd and vincent what is their goal why do they wait so long to <UNK> how could they be so sure shepherd would come back not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made the <UNK> any more pleasant you would still have bad lines really bad acting particularly by shepherd cheesy effects and poor direction luckily the stars escaped from this movie <UNK> shepherd soon went on to star in <UNK> with bruce willis jan michael vincent went on to be featured in dozens of b movies often in over the top parts raymond <UNK> made a pile of perry mason television movies right up until his death vincent <UNK> went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films martin <UNK> who played a <UNK> law <UNK> officer quickly made the terrific alone in the <UNK> and the awful the <UNK> before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently you can bet none of these stars ever want their careers to return to the return ' <UNK> score 2 out of 10
<START> the script for this tv soap opera is so bad that even a hopkins at some point had to play like an <UNK> drama student so as to bring some life in his script dead character i do not know whether this was the purpose of the director but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nothing but vanity fear and lack of self <UNK> the real <UNK> possibly was all that but then why make a movie about him <UNK> was a bit more convincing and his long way down was as if closer to the truth <UNK> <UNK> was plain ridiculous not because of sarandon but because of the <UNK> script while she had to be the central character of this alleged <UNK> drama watch it only if you enjoy <UNK> soap opera
<START> hamlet is by far my favorite of all of shakespeare's works <UNK> is one heck of an actor his portrayal of this was just amazing his <UNK> were breathtaking for as long as it was it is rare for a film to hold my interest however i was <UNK> in this particular piece i recommend this to anyone both fan of shakespeare and those not so much this has everything the modern world looks for in its films murder betrayal and <UNK> not to knock mel <UNK> version but <UNK> touches the whole work this leaves no stone <UNK> when you finish the film it will feel as if you read the play yourself um how you say two thumbs up

<START> police story is arguably one of the best works by the master of action himself compared to other action films police story makes <UNK> and stallone look like <UNK> the stunt scenes are well <UNK> and the action scenes are superb if new line cinema has any sense they would release this in theaters
<START> sorry but i will spoil both the plot line and the ending for you in hopes of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one that i now face the father dies and the mother asks santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for christmas and santa does dad is <UNK> happy healthy and totally unaware of the fact that he had died all ends <UNK> sweet br br but as a parent who recently watched my five year old lose his best <UNK> friend it was a horror flick now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his buddy back is to ask santa do not <UNK> the <UNK> of a young heart no amount of <UNK> will convince him that it was only a movie and that his dog is not coming back for christmas it has been heart breaking to watch his joy only to know that christmas eve he will have to face his loss <UNK> br br shame on you on behalf of all the <UNK> that have lost a loved one recently it is hard enough to deal with the loss one time for a child but there are some wishes that we shouldn't even portray as a possibility
<START> when philo vance edmund lowe is standing <UNK> on the edge of a balcony high above the city apparently <UNK> and just about to step to his death it immediately reminded me of a nearly identical scene in another film made nine years later the woman in green in which sherlock holmes basil <UNK> is similarly about to <UNK> himself into space while being <UNK> br br happily both philo vance and sherlock holmes survive these attempts at murder by <UNK> criminals exciting cinematic suspense in both these scenes when will they learn you can't cloud the minds of great fictional detectives
<START> i am rarely moved to make these kind of comments but after sitting through most of <UNK> dreadful movie i feel like i have really earned the right to say what i feel about it i couldn't actually make it right to the end and became one of the half dozen or more walk outs about 1 3rd of the audience after the <UNK> plot <UNK> dialogue and insulting characterisation became just too much to bear this film is all pose and no art all style and no substance it is <UNK> down by dreadful acting a genuinely dire script indifferent cinematography and student level production values how it got <UNK> started and finished is a mystery to me i bet you a million <UNK> it never goes on general release the proper critics would tear it apart a really bad film shockingly bad a really really really poor effort and that is without even mentioning the gratuitous new born <UNK> gets dropped into a deep fat <UNK> moment totally meaningless utterly lightweight poorly put together this movie is a dreadful embarrassment for uk cinema
<START> i actually saw this movie at a theater as soon as i handed the <UNK> my money she said two words i had never heard at a theater before or since no <UNK> as soon as i heard those words i should have just <UNK> bye bye to my cash and gone home but no <UNK> i went in and watched the movie this movie didn't make anyone in the theater laugh not even once not even <UNK> mostly we sat there in stunned silence every ten minutes or so someone would yell this movie sucks the audience would applaud <UNK> then sit there in stunned bored silence for another ten minutes
<START> before i watched this film i read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the best films ever ha ha scene by scene the tension grows alright from the annoying characters in this movie from the little girl talking <UNK> and trying to <UNK> the little boy to the killer just running about without any notice and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy things just seem to happen and then go unanswered in this film as i watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction then just doesn't go anywhere but into a new direction and on and on br br the acting is great but the writing is horrible each character in each scene says or does something so unbelievable unrealistic and the reactions of the fellow cast extras are simply strange there are no <UNK> to the problems developed throughout the film making it confusing and ultimately a big waste of time
<START> this low grade universal <UNK> has just been announced as an upcoming dvd release but intended as part of a collection of similar movies that i already had in my possession i decided to <UNK> it from other channels rather than wait for that legitimate release which is just as well since the end result was not anything particularly special if <UNK> atmospheric at that for starters the plot is pretty weak  even though in a way it <UNK> the vincent price vehicle theatre of blood 1973 <UNK> without any of that film's campy gusto what we have here in fact is a <UNK> <UNK> martin <UNK>  whom we even see sharing his <UNK> plate of cheese with his pet cat  who upon finding himself on the receiving end of art critic alan <UNK> <UNK> pen one time too many decides to end it all by <UNK> himself into the nearby river however while <UNK> just that action he is anticipated by <UNK> <UNK> escaped killer dubbed the <UNK> and naturally enough saves the poor guy's life with the intention of having the latter do all the dirty work for him in <UNK> although it is supposedly set in the art circles of new york all we really see at work is <UNK> and commercial painter robert <UNK> who keeps painting the same <UNK> blonde girl joan <UNK> over and over in banal poses  how is that for art who conveniently enough is engaged to a rival art critic virginia grey of <UNK> before long the latter is discovered with his spine broken and <UNK> is suspected but then investigating detective bill <UNK> gets the bright idea of engaging another critic to <UNK> a <UNK> review of <UNK> work i did not know that publicity sketches got reviewed so as to <UNK> how violent his reaction is going to be in the meantime <UNK> <UNK> himself into thinking that he is creating his masterpiece by <UNK> <UNK> uniquely <UNK>  and recognizable  <UNK> which needless to say <UNK> the attention of the constantly visiting grey we are led to believe that she lacks material for her weekly <UNK> <UNK> to the <UNK> of both artist and model <UNK> although the <UNK> is fully aware of how grey looks thanks to her aforementioned haunting of <UNK> flea bitten pad he <UNK> off <UNK>  who had by then become <UNK> girl  in <UNK> apartment and <UNK> <UNK> talking to you guessed it grey about his intention to dump him as the fall guy for the police sends the slow witted giant off his deep <UNK> down to destroying his own now completed <UNK> image curiously enough although this was <UNK> <UNK> film his name in the credits is <UNK> by the <UNK> introducing
<START> hey look deal with it there are much better portrayals of the <UNK> of black america than this although i think this story is weak my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story which i have mentioned blows br br this was made in the mid 80's and is horrible in the music score department it's funny to see oprah as a latter day crack whore type br br the scene where bigger <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> into the <UNK> pure classic cinema first off i don't care how drunk you are you will react to <UNK> degree flame no matter how bad your acting but they really <UNK> that scene it was comical i'll tell you what though i had great satisfaction in seeing elizabeth <UNK> burn in a faux death she <UNK> me
<START> any movie in which brooke <UNK> out acts a fonda is going to be both an <UNK> and a horror <UNK> actually is only bad because she's youthful inexperienced and clearly not well directed by her co star peter fonda is bad because well because he's bad i liked him in <UNK> gold years later but lord above he's awful here not that anyone else is good there's not a single performance outside henry <UNK> delightful cameo that is even passable i've never seen a movie with this many bad performances in the case of luke <UNK> the chief villain it's clear this is because of poor dialogue and direction as he's done good work in the past but his partner played by ted <UNK> is an embarrassing ham the writing is just bloody awful and the actors cannot be <UNK> for the terrible things they have to say but they say them so badly the editing and direction are worse than pedestrian shots are held way too long for no dramatic reason or cut off before the impact of the scene can be realized this picture was far worse than i'd imagined and would have been utterly forgotten and probably never even made without the participation of a couple of famous names one bright spot the cinematography in the grand canyon is exquisite capturing the beauty of that area in a way even big screen <UNK> productions have not quite done so well and finally either this is a bad version of paper moon with a lovable pair of father daughter types or it's a bad version of pretty baby with a considerably more <UNK> romantic relationship between a forty something and a 13 year old it suggests more of the latter than the former and thus is pretty disturbing
<START> kubrick meets king it sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980 i remember then the movie came out and the kubrick <UNK> have been <UNK> with the king <UNK> ever since br br the king <UNK> say stanley kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it the kubrick <UNK> don't give a damn about king's story they talk about <UNK> tracking shots camera angles this is a film they insist it should be considered on its own as it happens both camps are correct unfortunately br br if one views it purely as an adaptation of king's novel the shining is indeed a failure a wasted opportunity a series of <UNK> narrative <UNK> br br i used to blame that on kubrick's screenwriter the writer diane johnson author of le marriage <UNK> le divorce etc has a reputation as an novelist of social manners maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of <UNK> relations or family dynamics but the little blue collar town of <UNK> <UNK> doesn't exist on any map in her <UNK> universe br br kubrick the <UNK> probably found her <UNK> however he of course is the real auteur and considered on its own merits his screenplay for the shining with its <UNK> of <UNK> psychology <UNK> <UNK> and implied reincarnation just doesn't stand up to logical analysis br br i'm willing to consider kubrick's shining on its own terms i'm even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror genre movie but it doesn't succeed as a <UNK> study of isolation alienation and madness either <UNK> either way the film pretty much falls apart br br are the horrors of the overlook hotel real or do they exist only in the mind first as <UNK> nightmares suffered by little danny <UNK> then as the hallucinations of his father one notes how whenever jack <UNK> is seen talking to a ghost he is in fact looking into a mirror one notes how the <UNK> frozen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> appears to <UNK> jack's <UNK> convoluted psyche very deep stuff br br but if indeed the <UNK> ghosts are purely <UNK> of jack <UNK> growing insanity then who exactly lets the trapped jack out of the hotel <UNK> dead <UNK> walk in closet so that he can go on his climactic <UNK> wielding rampage br br and can anyone explain with a straight face that black and white photograph <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of nicholson as a <UNK> party goer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotel ballroom wall during the film's closing seconds are we to seriously conclude that jack <UNK> bad <UNK> <UNK> from a some sort of past life experience and if you swallow that since when are <UNK> people supposed to be exact physical <UNK> their past <UNK> br br maybe kubrick didn't care about his storyline maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror whatever the case the film tries to <UNK> its narrative <UNK> to have it both ways rational and supernatural as a result the story is a mess this movie hasn't improved with age and it certainly doesn't improve with repeated viewings br br i don't deny that a few moments of fear <UNK> and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long long film but those <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> blood seen repeatedly in little <UNK> visions are absurd and laughable and jack <UNK> infamous tag lines wendy i'm home and <UNK> johnny merely <UNK> the movie's dramatic tension and <UNK> its narrative energy i know i sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief <UNK> glad we don't have to take this stuff seriously finally kubrick is completely at sea or else utterly cynical during those scenes in which wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to <UNK> their son a <UNK> full of <UNK> guests all sitting there dead in their party hats <UNK> now i really am afraid br br given jack <UNK> brilliance over the years one can only assume that he gave just the sort of <UNK> rolling <UNK> <UNK> scenery <UNK> performance that the director wanted the performance of shelley duvall as a sort of female version of don <UNK> in the ghost and mr chicken is best passed over in silence br br this movie simply doesn't succeed not as an adaptation not on its own terms it probably merits a 3 out of 10 but i'm giving it a 1 because it has been so <UNK> over rated in this forum
<START> wow i can't believe i'm the first and only one to post a comment on this great movie br br although the movie itself seemed interesting enough the real thing that attracted me to this one is matt <UNK> granted most people probably either think he's too <UNK> happy or just plain sucks but we're both the same age and from the same generation and i've watched this guy so many times that he's one of my favorites now this is one of the few movies where he is the big shot and main star kind of like in <UNK> punk another great <UNK> film br br <UNK> this is <UNK> your usual heist movies but with more twists than anything which start to amount to <UNK> also very notable in this movie is another great actor named vincent <UNK> a very under appreciated person in the film industry the woman in the movie is a newcomer and she isn't too bad although you know they hired her mainly for her accent and the nude scene br br it's a game of jack vs jill vs bob as each want to <UNK> the <UNK> but share with no one they all try to get <UNK> to kill off the other and it's a <UNK> waiting to explode matt shows his true <UNK> as the scheming jack who initially starts the whole scheme vincent and woman play a couple of art thieves who are in need of money due to a lack of business <UNK> character is a bit deranged and <UNK> throughout the movie but that only add to the intensity of the film br br the surprises left and right are well welcomed and the ending is very non cliche and makes you feel happy well maybe that depends on the type of endings you like this movie kept me very interested besides the fact matt was in it it's a great movie and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies <UNK> probably won't like this movie but they don't watch movies cause they like movies anyway
<START> i admit i had to fast forward through this poorly transferred dvd after about 30 minutes nothing was happening and everyone has already described the plot but has anyone mentioned the opening scene a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's <UNK> on the grass in the front yard i'm guessing the <UNK> kid did it put it's never explained really <UNK> opening br br i wish this had been a better written or thought out film because what we're left with if pretty <UNK> and a movie that makes no sense isn't a clever movie it's just a poorly executed film br br i would like to see a <UNK> up version and if there was any missing footage i would like to see if it would help otherwise this is an odd little film that is best if fast <UNK> through
<START> i watched the movie in a preview and i really loved it the cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious another highlight of the movie is definitely the music which hopefully will be released soon i recommend it to everyone who likes the british humour and especially to all musicians go and see it's great
<START> without question this film has to be one of the greatest in cinematic history i have it watched too many times to remember and each time it is like i am seeing the film for the first time br br where does one begin br br <UNK> <UNK> central performance is undoubtedly one of the finest of her career followed closely by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> each movement and nuance of her performance makes any other bollywood heroine pale into significance her <UNK> interpretation of <UNK> coupled with her grace tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of <UNK> is like nothing ever seen on the bollywood screen br br <UNK> is perhaps the most <UNK> interpretation of the human condition the photography <UNK> cinematography and <UNK> en scene are so charged with symbolism and meaning that the viewer is left breathless br br <UNK> music is <UNK> his knowledge of the music of the <UNK> <UNK> is incredible and the way in which he <UNK> the narrative with dark atmospheric <UNK> and overwhelming romantic <UNK> is indeed remarkable br br my only advice to anyone who seriously enjoys the spectacle of total cinema should watch this epic <UNK> on life and art
<START> i saw this at the <UNK> film festival it was awful every clichéd violent rich boy fantasy was on display you just knew how it was going to end especially with all the shots of the <UNK> wife and the rape of the first girl br br the worst part was the q a with the director writer and writer producer they tried to come across as <UNK> but you could tell they're the types that get off on violence i bet anything they frequent <UNK> and do drugs br br don't waste your time i had to keep my boyfriend from walking out of it
<START> please don't rent or even think about buying this movie they don't even have it available at the red box to rent which would cost a 1 i think its worth less than that the main reason why i rented this d movie was because jenna jameson is in the movie lol between 2 5 min i will give credit that the movie had hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity but other than that you might as well buy another d horror movie that has the same thing with nobody you know ginger <UNK> has more acting time in this movie than jenna she's not even on the front cover of the movie nor her name i recommend people to watch zombie <UNK> because you see jenna almost throughout the whole movie nude most of the time this movie is a big disappointment such a huge waste of time
<START> i found this movie to be a great idea that didn't deliver it seems they found a way to build suspense but couldn't stage their <UNK> very well in one case the police are on the clock to find the <UNK> of the <UNK> they <UNK> go from dentist to dentist to match a dental record at the same time the kidnapped man mason escapes through the elevator <UNK> after all the build up the police arrive at the same time he gets free which is very anti climatic to say the least there are also large narration scenes that take us inside the thinking of the <UNK> husband and wife which <UNK> from the suspense rather than adds to it we are fully aware of their tension and the voice over is an insult and <UNK> the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with the fear as hitchcock proved time and again is far more effective the greatest disappointment is to sit through the whole movie and the get the quick rather bland ending i mean it just ends in a <UNK>
<START> the sea is watching was an interesting film experience first of all the overall feel was intense <UNK> claustrophobic and small each frame seemed to be a photograph of something inside something very focused and not part of a bigger picture it was obvious what we were to look at in each frame the <UNK> of the set itself contributed to that feeling of <UNK> and intensity the lights along the middle of the road cut the road in half and the tiny gate to the tiny <UNK> followed by the tiny and few <UNK> that served as the <UNK> that made up what seemed to be the entire town even the view of the ocean was framed by a tiny landing on which one can count the number of longer grass <UNK> in the wind no <UNK> views in fact it reminded me of the <UNK> sequence of <UNK> <UNK> where the camera <UNK> focuses in to the <UNK> creating again a feeling of a small area where everything is happening br br while the acting was passable considering i really could not <UNK> how the lines were truly delivered i felt that the actions were overly melodramatic and nonsensical why <UNK> would continue carrying on the way she did when <UNK> announced his impending marriage really didn't seem true  people hadn't really changed that much and the character <UNK> was so strong and <UNK> that even if they were busy taking on o <UNK> business for <UNK> the reaction seemed out of character and unnecessary and distracting another example of odd acting was when the drunk boyfriend of <UNK> showed up and <UNK> decided to <UNK> and was pushed down the stairs the way in which he got up and <UNK> came up the stairs and the ensuing fight outside among the <UNK> was simply unsatisfying it wasn't that i like fight scenes  <UNK> <UNK>  but it seemed a little stilted and again overly dramatic br br otherwise while not a beautiful movie to watch it provided an interesting glimpse into the darker side of prostitution as opposed to the geisha unfortunately perhaps it fed into our expectations of <UNK> women the honey  i'll give you a deal comments supported by the over stretched actions and seriously caused me to doubt whether indeed 19th century prostitutes really acted in that way but once inside the house the inner <UNK> became most interesting vivid and real and provided a scenario i never anticipated or imagined in my romantic view of japan in the 19th century
<START> i'm probably one of the biggest nancy drew fans out there i've read every book three times over and i've played a lot of the nancy drew games i loved this movie it kept you entertained the whole time you watched it i went with about 10 of my friends and everyone loved it there were three woman sitting behind us who appeared to be in their late 30's to early 40's and i asked them how they liked it they said they loved it so you see it will be an entertainment to all ages you just have to give it a chance and it teaches a lesson too just be yourself even if everyone around you is exactly alike so overall this move was great i'm going to see it a second time now so stop bashing it please its a really good movie
<START> dressed to kill understandably made a bit of a <UNK> when first released in 1980 you had police girl in a role that was mega erotic as angie <UNK> played a sexually frustrated housewife looking for good times in all the wrong <UNK> and there into apartment <UNK> plus nancy allen as a call girl michael caine as norman <UNK> sophisticated new york cousin and enough lurid imagery to last two movies of the period today it's slightly less <UNK> by standards and such though the <UNK> version has some of the most hot content of any of de palma's films at least in his quasi auteur period of the 70s and early 80s where he seemed to repeat themes over and over ideas taken right off the film <UNK> of hitchcock classics and given a <UNK> <UNK> it's a simple tale that one partly already saw in sisters and then again to an extent in body double and also in blow out <UNK> allen plays call girl liz blake who has to clear her name of suspicion of killing kate dickinson in full blown <UNK> mode after being found with a razor the murder weapon from dr <UNK> office michael caine stone cold performance most of the way br br from the start which de palma seems to do as a way of setting up a dangerous sexual fantasy scene as a way of <UNK> the opening scene of carrie which perhaps he does just in editing terms we get a series of technical knock out turns through the point of view of style itself the tracking shots in the museum meant to stir up more of a fascination with the process itself of following and wanting to be followed than any kind of tension the chase through the subway a <UNK> to carlito's way is done with a precise level of suspense meanwhile with a slightly exploitation bit thrown in with the black gang the character of peter <UNK> son keith gordon who plays what is essentially a younger version of the real life de palma as a kid science geek obsessed with hitchcock and <UNK> and it's all entertaining and <UNK> as hell as something that comes close to a real <UNK> of what makes de palma's thrillers so unique while being so self <UNK> <UNK> by a <UNK> attitude of film making br br on the other hand that same self consciousness ended up coming back to bite the director in the butt a few times in recent years and somehow in dressed to kill it starts to become very <UNK> and disappointing as the story has to wrap itself up as the psycho themes come together even more apparently man who wants a sex change doesn't even think he's killing as it is she who is doing it there is an <UNK> scene in the police station that makes the aforementioned <UNK> film look like an astonishing psychological revelation and the final scenes at <UNK> house also calling painfully into <UNK> a much more accomplished sequence in carrie are meant for a manipulation that even for de palma is asking for it the final shot especially albeit a <UNK> class in how to copy yourself yet there is a very deranged and within itself perfect scene at the mental hospital amid this confused denouement where the doctor does some work on a nurse to which all the other inmates act like animals in a <UNK> and an over head shot going up and up over the scene is one of the best shots of sexual general <UNK> ever captured on film br br a shame then that the film ends on such a strange and unsettling manner where up until then it is a remarkable piece of pulp cinema where class is all around in the technical aspects soft lighting intricate camera movements seemingly so simple amid subject matter that should be found in the mix of <UNK> for 25 cents it's no masterpiece but i'd certainly take it over most of the director's recent thrillers any day
<START> spoilers in first paragraph this movie's anti german sentiment seems painfully dated now but it's a brilliant example of great war time propaganda it was made back when cecil b demille was still a great director ignore all his later best picture academy awards he never made a very good sound film this movie lacks the comedy of most of <UNK> other films and really it was <UNK> movie not <UNK> the <UNK> of the germans can be compared to the way the <UNK> of 2000 did the same to the british the only good german in the film was a reluctant villain who had the ironic name of <UNK> they even had pickford take an ill <UNK> trip on a luxury ship that gets <UNK> by a german submarine so <UNK> get the americans more <UNK> up to war the sinking of the <UNK> or watching america's favorite canadian <UNK> sinking in it all throughout the film demille runs his protagonist from one kind of horrible <UNK> to another barely escaping death <UNK> <UNK> rape execution and explosions that go off in just the right place to keep her <UNK> the way she is saved from a firing squad is no more believable than the way the humans in jurassic park were ultimately rescued from the <UNK> if i was any more <UNK> to such propaganda i would <UNK> myself for having a part german <UNK> br br was it a good film aside from a humorous running gag about americans abroad thinking they're <UNK>  that was apparently a joke even back then  you might not be entertained you'll find it more than a little melodramatic and obviously one sided but the first thing that came to my mind after watching it is that it was years before <UNK> false portrayal of a massacre <UNK> the language of cinema as well as a movie's potential for propaganda it made me wonder what became of cecil b demille somewhere between the <UNK> of sound and the greatest show on earth he seemed to lose his ambition ben <UNK> looked expensive but not ambitious in a sentence this movie is for 1 film historians 2 silent film buffs 3 mary pickford fans or 4 demille fans if such a person exists
<START> <UNK> clutter wife bonnie and their teenage children <UNK> and nancy were much liked and respected in their tiny town of <UNK> kansas but in the early hours of 14 november 1959 all four were brutally murdered rather unexpectedly the crime made an impression on author truman capote who rushed to the scene and followed the course of the case to its conclusion the result was the book in cold blood controversial shocking and exceptionally well written it became an international best <UNK> and it remains a <UNK> for crime writers to this day br br the 1967 film version of <UNK> work is almost as remarkable as the book itself filmed in black and white in many of the real life locations it has a slightly documentary quality icy and detached and the overall cast is exceptional this is the film on which robert <UNK> reputation as an actor rests and deservedly so as killer perry smith blake traps you between a profound <UNK> and the shock of unexpected sympathy it is a masterful performance from start to finish as richard <UNK> scott wilson is no less fine br br like <UNK> book the film opens with smith and <UNK> as they travel to kansas and brings them to the clutter home only to suddenly flash past the crime to detail the investigation that finally resulted in their arrest and conviction the <UNK> of the film has always been the moment at which we at last see what occurred in the clutter home actually filmed in the clutter house itself it is a <UNK> sequence horrific and deeply disturbing br br director and writer richard brooks <UNK> the film with a very powerful sense of <UNK> <UNK> only in the sense that he allows the film to become slightly preachy given the overall power of the film however this becomes a trivial annoyance strong stuff and recommended br br <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> i wasn't expecting much and to be honest i didn't like this film the first time around but watching it again and i realised that it's kinda cool sure it's a one joke film but it's a funny gag br br someone posted that it could be better written and it could be i think this film had the potential to be a over the top my cousin <UNK> but with a horror host instead of a lawyer sadly it's a wasted opportunity with just a bit more writing it could be a classic the kids are underused there's no reason why they should <UNK> on to elvira apart from the obvious reasons it would have been great to see their relationship <UNK> i know it's a comedy but it's little differences that separate the good films from the brilliant br br elvira herself is always fun and engaging not to mention <UNK> every time she smiles you will too it's hard to knock a film when the main character is so charming and it really is her charm don't let her looks fool you into thinking that she's some sort of <UNK> well she is but she's a nice one the sort of person you'd let look after your kids wouldn't let her cook for them though br br i'd recommend giving it a go br br just don't expect too much br br she's more than just a great set of boobs she's also an incredible pair of legs
<START> if you're a fan of film noir and think they don't make 'em like they used to here is your answer they just don't make 'em in hollywood anymore we must turn to the french to remember how satisfying subtle and terrific a well made film from that genre can be read my lips is a wonderfully nasty little gift to the faithful from director jacques <UNK> featuring sharp storytelling and fine performances from <UNK> <UNK> and vincent <UNK> br br the basic plot could have been written in the 40's dumb but appealing ex con and a smart but <UNK> femme fatale who turns out to be <UNK> ambitious discover each other while living lives of bleak desperation and longing manipulate each other to meet their own ends develop complex love hate relationship cook up criminal scheme involving heist double crosses close calls and lots of money all action takes place in depressing seedy and or poorly lit locations br br <UNK> has fashioned some modern twists of course the femme fatale is an <UNK> office worker who happens to be nearly deaf and uses her lip reading ability to take revenge on those who <UNK> her and where you might expect steamy love scenes you discover that both characters are sexually awkward and immature add in a bit of modern technology and music and it seems like a contemporary film but make no mistake this is old school film noir it's as good as any film from the genre and easily one of the best films i've seen all year
<START> a stunning realization occurs when some sort of phenomenon takes place be it <UNK> going off witnessing a robbery a <UNK> <UNK> devastating everything in it's path or for that matter any other spectacular <UNK> in the case of the <UNK> family however <UNK> was something which was no more complex than their day to day lives montana in the early <UNK> century was an environment which was rough and <UNK> the <UNK> family was comprised of four people the father a minister who was <UNK> driven to raise his family properly his wife was god <UNK> and <UNK> the two boys were well boys what else can you say brad pitt starred in this film before he was really the brad pitt and his acting performance in this film was to say the least remarkable his brother norman was the cerebral type he was touched by emotions that were genuine and motivated by a set of values that <UNK> montana <UNK> with paul brad pitt was a <UNK> from the <UNK> and lived on the edge you would think that montana in the <UNK> had no such thing yet somehow gambling drinking and violent <UNK> were as much a part of paul as was his fly fishing rod fly fishing did i say that <UNK> this was the core of this movie's theme the recreation of fly fishing served as the cohesive bond which <UNK> the <UNK> spirits of the <UNK> brothers and to a lesser degree the father i would describe the acting in this film as incredibly believable and the cinematography went beyond sensational put it this way anyone who sees this film will want to live in montana breathtaking filmography of <UNK> than blue mountains and <UNK> captured the youth and <UNK> that the <UNK> brothers had for life seldom in a film do you witness <UNK> feelings immediately <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> to accomplish whatever it may be that someone wishes to accomplish the <UNK> brothers lived life to the <UNK> and for better or worse the father knew that this was going to be the only way the two of them could become men robert redford directs this film and tells the story of the <UNK> through the perspective of the older brother norman norman gets offered a position at the university of chicago at age 26 and marries the woman he will always be in love with what this film also points out is that the younger brother paul has <UNK> an accomplishment of his own by being the epitome of a remarkable fly <UNK> the <UNK> side of life <UNK> in the younger brother's existence and <UNK> an <UNK> form of <UNK> for the <UNK> family as most human shortcomings go the <UNK> family made light of <UNK> waters literally and thus established <UNK> as a family by putting necessary <UNK> on br br the end of the movie river runs through it presents an <UNK> of life through the eyes of the older brother for norman <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> to <UNK> in his <UNK> years such a fate is largely due to the fact that <UNK> on his life is <UNK> to yearning for people who have passed away the fond memories of his brother his wife his mother and his father must now be viewed <UNK> for norman his life has been <UNK> to stubborn facts that have determined his dubious <UNK> and <UNK> resolve something as simple as the statement this was your life and that is how you lived it is a somber <UNK> of the joy the sorrow the regrets and the love he gave as well as was the <UNK> of best put in the last <UNK> he heard his father give his father said we can completely love someone without completely understanding them whether you agree with what has happened in your life or not it happened nonetheless norman <UNK> must come to grips with the fact that his life has been <UNK> by <UNK> norman <UNK> has become a <UNK> <UNK> who is <UNK> by virtual conclusions to his life the murky waters of <UNK> <UNK> rivers serve as a vicious and <UNK> <UNK> to his years on earth without question the very prolific statement of what seems complicated is really very simple <UNK> a very <UNK> message in this movie more simply put the people and places which were important in <UNK> life are now only a bittersweet memory merely a painfully intellectual <UNK> of events which are <UNK> by the haunted waters of <UNK> beautiful <UNK> and rivers to which for the entire <UNK> family all things <UNK> into one and a river runs through it
<START> this movie isn't worth the film it was photographed on the dialog is flat filled with cliché <UNK> lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time the choppy shaky film style is a cheap imitation of the the ring style visual effects the characters do not even act like a normal person would for example the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door creeps around the house all frightened and <UNK> and she doesn't even once call out her sister's name to see if she is home what you would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her way too many flashbacks to her childhood too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director it is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street up the <UNK> around this corner over here over there oh a side view now a front view enough already you would think you are watching a tv commercial for the <UNK> terrible movie 0 out of 100 i really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it
<START> some not so <UNK> spoilers ahead br br why do people when they are <UNK> or sick or scared at a club cut through the middle of the crowded dance floor on their way to the bathroom br br who in their right mind would hide under a bed when someone breaks into their room br br how often do you knock on a <UNK> door and when they don't immediately answer you open the door walk in shout a few <UNK> and then start going through their stuff br br if you were being pursued by someone you just discovered was a murderer what would you do quietly sneak off and hide under a wooden platform or among metal <UNK> run quietly of course to a <UNK> old <UNK> or other <UNK> structure br br i could be talking about almost any thriller that's come out in the last few years but since this is the the return page obviously i'm talking about the return i saw it free because i work at a movie theater and make a point of screening all the scary movies i thought this one was tolerable aside from the well worn clichés sarah michelle <UNK> is really drab and looks kind of huh through most of the film the details of the plot are slowly given out as the movie progresses and it's almost enough to make it interesting except there wasn't enough explanation as it moved on and so i was almost lost until the last 2 3 of it br br if you're a die hard thriller fan it's worth seeing at least once if there's nothing better at the theater and you really want to watch a movie eh i guess it's worth a <UNK> ticket if you thought the trailer made it look like an interesting movie and you can't wait wait
<START> amazing effects for a movie of this time a <UNK> of the <UNK> of war and how war becomes a <UNK> of itself br br a wonderful thing about this movie is it is now public <UNK> and available at archive <UNK> no charge no sign up necessary watch it in one sitting and you will be <UNK> br br i plan to share this flick with as many people as possible as i had never heard of it before and i am a hard core sci fi fan br br i would like to see how others react to this movie br br watch it br br rate it br br tell us what you think
<START> robert altman shouldn't make a movie like this but the fact that he did and that it turns out to be a reasonably good and tightly wound thriller in that <UNK> tradition of <UNK> thrillers shows a <UNK> that is commendable in the <UNK> man he actually has to work with something that unfortunately he isn't always very successful at or at least it's not the first thing on his <UNK> as director plot there's one of those big <UNK> almost pot <UNK> plots where a sleazy lawyer gets caught up with a desperate low class woman and then a <UNK> figure whom the woman is related with enters their lives in the most <UNK> ways twists and plot ensues <UNK> <UNK> and it's surprising that altman would really want to take on one of these i saw that coming from back there endings or just a such a semi conventional thriller br br but it's a surprise that pays off because oddly enough altman is able to catch some of that very fine behavior or rather is able to unintentionally <UNK> it out of a very well cast ensemble of a small town <UNK> environment the film <UNK> with atmosphere if not total <UNK> <UNK> sometimes it's good and sometimes just decent for altman as <UNK> is possibly going to be hit by a big <UNK> and the swamp and <UNK> and rain keep things <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> so the atmosphere is really potent but so are performances from sometimes hysterical kenneth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> who lawyer <UNK> gets caught up with and robert downey jr when is he not good as the private detective in <UNK> employ did i neglect robert duvall who in just five minutes of screen time makes such an <UNK> impression to hang the bad <UNK> of the picture on br br as said some of the plot is a little weak or just kind of standard lawyer is divorced bitter custody battle <UNK> innocent and goofy kids but at the same time i think altman saw something captivating in the material something darker than some of the other <UNK> works that has this standing out somehow if it's not entirely masterful it still works on its limited terms as a what will happen next mystery southern noir
<START> tim robbins is oddly <UNK> here cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s new jersey who falls in love with a <UNK> blonde who turns out to be albert <UNK> niece although he's on screen much of the time robbins <UNK> out the inner <UNK> of his intense persona and fades into the background it's easy to forget he's even in the picture <UNK> romantic comedy with a gimmick that being walter matthau playing einstein who does what he can with a <UNK> conceived character otherwise it's <UNK> and sunny directed rather <UNK> by fred <UNK> who shows heart but no wit or brains meg ryan is her usual <UNK> self and the chemistry between she and robbins is charming like that of an <UNK> sister and her big brother from

<START> as always this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless tv told a lot of lies about <UNK> in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad and claimed we all made over 100 a day when 20 40 a day was much closer to reality when someone drove by where i held up a sign offering to work and offered me work i actually went and took the work if i was physically able and if i would been offered the 100 000 id damned sure invested in in apt <UNK> for at least 2 years and kept most in the bank and still left myself 10 <UNK> for <UNK> 1 2 and 2 5 cash games at the <UNK> i usually always win and could win decent if i just had a <UNK> instead i win about 1000 a month is all playing in always minimum buying in due to not wanting to risk losing it all i was only homeless cause i didn't wanna risk spending all my money and going broke sometimes i had over 1000 2000 in my <UNK> while i slept outside anyone wanting to talk contact <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> i admit i was different than most homeless people though due to the fact i never <UNK> smoke or took drugs im no longer homeless am now in <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> a month and getting <UNK> and spend most of my time winning at online poker mom and <UNK> <UNK> worked hard to get me <UNK> glad my days of hiding in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleeping worrying about getting caught by security are finally over had this tv crew picked me <UNK> been over a lot sooner its a shame how they don't better <UNK> who they pick
<START> whoever wrote the nice post about this must have been a friend of these guys this is bad even for backyard wrestling in fact this isn't even backyard wrestling really it's a few guys hitting each other on a <UNK> each guys is about 45 <UNK> wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment value in this it is just a few bored kids that even give yard <UNK> a bad name if that is possible if you want to see some entertaining backyard wrestling pick up backyard wrestling a pleasure for pain it stars the 2 biggest names in <UNK> <UNK> and josh <UNK> these guys are good they have actually went since <UNK> it and gotten <UNK> trained as real pro <UNK> they went <UNK> and have gotten better i recommend checking out those 2 guys <UNK> is insane and off the hook so don't waste your time or your cash on this crappy dvd there are better back yard videos out there
<START> in the early 1970s many of us who had <UNK> <UNK> acid alternative culture <UNK> had realised that mainstream society was not going to change in the way we thought it would for me this film defined the tension of now what that many of the people i knew felt at that time do we head for the <UNK> and create our own vision of <UNK> or do we <UNK> and push for change br br from the <UNK> gestures to police the radical <UNK> the music of pink <UNK> to the love making and the explosive images in the desert so much is in there it captures well a significant moment in time
<START> went to see this as me and my lady had little else to do on a sunday afternoon i like films that deal with sleazy loser characters and this is full of em after a slow start we get some good turns from the cast but it is the actual <UNK> that both makes and lets the film down the <UNK> is one of the funniest scenes i have seen in a film for a long while but is too short and could have made this a masterpiece overall <UNK> 2 out of 10
<START> one of my best friends brought this movie over one night with the words <UNK> watch the worst horror movie ever ' i always enjoy a good laugh at a bad horror flick and said yes i had expected your typical cheesy b slasher but this was beyond b this is z slasher the lowest of the low with obviously low budget extremely bad acting bad lightning no plot really bad so called <UNK> <UNK> shaky cameras and a horrible soundtrack this makes movies like house of wax look like oscar winning masterpieces the only good thing about it is about 15 seconds of one of the characters getting topless she had some very nice tits most of what i said during this film was along the lines of <UNK> this is actually so <UNK> <UNK> is the worst movie <UNK> and <UNK> not drunk enough for <UNK> so in conclusion don't waste your time or money
<START> really truly <UNK> <UNK> awful but actor <UNK> moore the movie lone ranger <UNK> himself competently as an actor he's the only one br br a rare treat for five minutes if you want to <UNK> the depths of <UNK> transparent special effects southern california as the moon again and again and again and acting so <UNK> inept that it may be a spoof except that it's clear that it isn't no humor here except unintentionally br br the dialogue may be worse than any of these other aspects and the costumes well enough said plot what plot bad guy well head bad guy and his henchmen including his <UNK> agent called <UNK> listen carefully or you'll suspect it's a spoof on the name of <UNK> <UNK> ray <UNK> and his unbelievably inept <UNK> who however have <UNK> that never need <UNK> as does <UNK> cody so there are numerous <UNK> <UNK> br br enjoy
<START> the biggest reason i had to see this movie was that it stars susan swift an outstanding and all too <UNK> actress time travel movies usually don't interest me and neither do movies about witchcraft but this movie was fascinating and creepy it didn't rely on outrageous special effects and it didn't focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer gets lost and confused this was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all
<START> this film screened last night at <UNK> paramount theater as part of the <UNK> film festival we were <UNK> with the presence of director mike <UNK> and stars adam sandler and don cheadle who took audience questions after the film it is a remarkable and powerful film about what it is like to lose yourself and begin to find your way back the performances are phenomenal and the story manages to be both tragic and funny in a way that is all too rare the trailer for the film tries a little too hard to emphasize the comedic aspects br br this is a <UNK> role for adam sandler while he has begun to transition to more dramatic roles with punch drunk love and <UNK> this role is a significant step forward for him as a dramatic actor he deserves an oscar nomination as he continues down to transition to more dramatic roles as tom hanks did and jim carrey is also doing in this role he seemed to be trying to channel dustin hoffman in rain man although playing an <UNK> man is certainly very different than <UNK> traumatized character both characters for different reasons are trapped in their own worlds of child like isolation and confusion br br don <UNK> performance is less surprising but just as good after hotel <UNK> and crash we've come to expect remarkable nuanced performances from cheadle he has the qualities of sincerity and honesty that comes through in this role but he too is also broken and struggling if not in the such profound ways as <UNK> character cheadle is struggling with difficulties in both his marriage and in his professional life as a dentist together the characters played by cheadle and sandler struggle to <UNK> each other in the way that true friends often do in a way that reminds me of matt damon and robin williams in good will hunting they are both searching for that part of the themselves that they have lost and trying to find again br br reign over me is one of the best major studio films to be released this year the soundtrack which is almost another character in the plot is wonderful the filming in the streets of new york a city that suffered a great tragedy and has also had to <UNK> itself is also quite beautiful the supporting roles by <UNK> <UNK> smith <UNK> tyler <UNK> <UNK> in a very odd role donald sutherland and mike <UNK> himself are all quite good br br writer director mike <UNK> has really delivered a story that so many will be able to connect with on numerous levels this is a story about grief family healing male friendship mental health and the meaning of love reign over me does not disappoint the film is almost hypnotic as it draws you into the lives of its characters hollywood would have a much better reputation if it made more character driven charming films like reign over me
<START> i should explain why i gave this piece of art 1 star rating out of possible 10 simply because it's hard or next to impossible to rate it <UNK> probably it would have been the same if i had given it 10 10 explanations anyway would have followed br br i am not fond of these pointless gore movies like hostel or so i think that's disgusting and pretty terrible in all the possible <UNK> meanings but as i found out after watching this movie there is a genre called historical drama and probably it would have been the case of 10 10 as it has plenty of it and tarantino would have been more than happier with it and made kill bill 3 to <UNK> even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible but the thing about historical drama genre is that it's a sub category of the trash movies where john romero is the undead gory emperor of the guts and so automatically it can't be rated as your <UNK> movie as these are movies that are made bad on purpose and you can't really tell whether the <UNK> bad moment was meant to be so or it was simply bad it's for the people who like to enjoy bad acting bad screenplay and bad everything else and by some turn of faith i am one of them too there are days when i have an urge of seeing a really bad movie and look up for some trash and here you go the day is saved but that's definitely an opinion of mine and doesn't have match with <UNK> else br br what i wanted to say is that if you want to watch some terrible movie then <UNK> <UNK> is definitely the choice but <UNK> my advice and don't rate it by <UNK> means
<START> i don't often go out of my way to write comments but for this i had to just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy this doesn't come close while the premise change in colour gender whatever is bad enough and has been done better many times before the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing <UNK> ever put on screen it would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks however the wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women as you will have guessed by now they fail completely i have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and make up people that hollywood can provide its appalling add to the mix a basketball player built like a building terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low and i like bad movies avoid like the plague
<START> my comments may be a bit of a spoiler for what it's worth stop now if you care enough br br saving grace should have been titled a paper thin excuse for old british women to get high on screen this film is dumb the incidental music is an annoyance as are the obvious hackneyed tunes that <UNK> pop up to comment on the narrative spirit in the sky for example oh i get it this is basically a cheech and chong movie made credible by its <UNK> english setting and brenda <UNK> overwhelming power to <UNK> emotion on an audience using her voice alone i could literally hear the folks over at high times magazine receiving their <UNK> over the enormous <UNK> that <UNK> this picture worst scene easy brenda attempts to <UNK> her <UNK> <UNK> on the street of london in a <UNK> white dress suit not funny not original not interesting not a good movie the 7 2 rating is the result of <UNK> over voting don't waste your time
<START> for a movie with a plot like this i would normally smell <UNK> in the first ten minutes and turn it off but this was very well made with emotional subtleties great acting and some genuinely funny moments it was also interesting to see a different culture a <UNK> one at that my wife and i both <UNK> it
<START> i saw this film awhile back while working on a trailer for the film's production company and it was terrible <UNK> is mediocre at best hopkins phones his performance in but still blows away <UNK> in their scenes together and alec looks bored trust me on this you should avoid this film like the plague if it ever gets released it seems to go on forever as the tired plot unfolds at a <UNK> pace it is relentlessly unfunny the cinematography is crappy and the direction is pedestrian alec baldwin should go to film school if he plans to direct again in terms of his acting his character is totally unlikable which makes it impossible to root for him dan <UNK> is pretty funny and the surprising makeup of the jury near the film's end is cute but this film is just plain awful
<START> in fact marc <UNK> off broadway adaptation of <UNK> was not so <UNK> as is generally believed br br i have a special interest in <UNK> my dad was part of the first full production in the us u of <UNK> theatre <UNK> did it around the end of ww2 <UNK> had been so nearly successful in <UNK> the play that they had to <UNK> the script and score from <UNK> in two different languages neither english a german <UNK> script and similar sources <UNK> adaptation not a translation which had the full <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> was a lot closer to the original than generally believed br br the problem is that the version thereof that most people know is the mgm cast recording recently available on <UNK> on cd which includes <UNK> arthur as lucy the big complete girl and can't i see her hands on <UNK> and shoulders thrown back on that line <UNK> was a major babe in the 50's paul <UNK> and john <UNK> was heavily <UNK> by mike <UNK> head of mgm records i mean 17 i think it was <UNK> s got cut to just damn br br at one time mgm also offered a 2 <UNK> set of the entire play <UNK> as heavily <UNK>
<START> blood legacy starts with the arrival of lawyer tom drake norman <UNK> to the dean estate <UNK> owned by the now deceased christopher dean john carradine upon his arrival he is <UNK> by mr <UNK> four children gregory jeff <UNK> his wife laura merry <UNK> victoria faith <UNK> johnny richard <UNK> plus leslie brooke mills her <UNK> carl <UNK> john smith drake plays a tape recording of they're late father's wishes after his death the estate worth <UNK> million dollars is to be split equally between his four children if any should die then the money would be split equally between the rest if all were to die the freaky servants <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> buck <UNK> the more <UNK> named frank john russell would pocket the lot well not satisfied with a quarter share of <UNK> million which is still almost 35 million back in 1971 which doesn't sound too bad to me someone decides they want it all for themselves it's not long before decapitated heads are turning up in the <UNK> br br co written produced directed by roy <UNK> blood legacy disappointed me on two accounts for starters this film's alternate much more common title is legacy of blood which is also the title of an obscure horror film directed by andy <UNK> back in <UNK> which i've always wanted to see both films are regularly mixed up as both have similar stories when i checked my on screen cable tv guide for legacy of blood i was excited because it said it was the <UNK> film even listed him as director so when i actually sat down to watch it i heard john <UNK> voice i then knew it wasn't the <UNK> film that i had wanted to see my heart <UNK> then of course there's the simple yet undeniably straight forward fact that blood legacy is a total utter piece of crap that is literally painful to watch at times the script by <UNK> eric <UNK> is slow boring extremely predictable the character's are absolutely bizarre in an annoying way the freak of a servant who <UNK> his sister to <UNK> him the strange set of brother's sisters who are just downright unlikeable so far removed from reality that any tension or mystery that the simplistic <UNK> story could have achieved is sorely missing then there's the awful twist ending that you can guess within the first 10 minutes it's boring to watch it's poorly paced it's just a chore to even think about it please someone save me as this is really bad stuff i could go on all day about how bad blood legacy is i really could br br director <UNK> was either working with a none existent budget or judging by this he shouldn't have even been directing traffic the entire film looks ugly it's poorly photographed there is no atmosphere or scares the blood gore is tame there's an axe in a head a decapitated head a scene when someone is <UNK> to death by <UNK> the best murder when someone's face is eaten by <UNK> however there are question marks over this scene so there's the victim right there's the tank of <UNK> right victims head is placed in <UNK> tank right <UNK> eat victims face right water remains crystal clear despite said victim having his face eaten <UNK> where's the blood br br technically blood legacy is terrible it looks awful the sound was obviously shot live it's <UNK> hard to hear which considering the terrible dialogue is maybe a <UNK> in disguise the acting was not going to win anyone any awards that's for sure the least said about it the better br br blood legacy is an awful film there really isn't a single positive aspect to it or if there is i can't think of it do yourself a favour don't bother with this one there are much better films out there
<START> i'd really really wanted to see this movie and waited for months to get it through our blockbuster total access account when it showed up in our <UNK> i threw it straight into the dvd player br br i was very sadly disappointed which in turn made me mad i'll give any movie a chance even if i want to walk out of the theater press <UNK> i watched it all the way through but didn't get anything from it but frustration br br the acting was very very good but that was about it nothing is explained while we understand that mathieu becomes depressed and lands in a <UNK> ward of some kind we're never given insight to his <UNK> while we understand that he and cedric break up again we don't see it happen or why it happened during an interview with <UNK> doctor cedric reveals that he'd cheated on him once but it was no big deal i expected to see this in flashbacks but no nothing we also gets the hints that cedric was the one to bring <UNK> to the hospital but again we don't see it br br i know some movies are a <UNK> it as it <UNK> basis but this movie honestly <UNK> me off when pierre <UNK> ex shows up in the club and starts trouble we don't see hide nor hair of him until near the end and it took me a good <UNK> of time to figure out that pierre was the ex his personality at the club and when <UNK> finds him are entirely different i might even be wrong saying this it was that confusing br br the film expects you to know everything and move along with its disjointed out of place and confusing pace i can keep up with films like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and other films that have flashbacks flash <UNK> left and right but <UNK> didn't capture and hold onto the style at the end of <UNK> <UNK> you know what's going on and discover the answer to the main mysteries <UNK> just leaves you hanging it has an air of <UNK> in its <UNK> not gonna tell you a damned thing figure it out for <UNK> presentation it's like reading a book with the chapters switched around and pages missing br br good acting like i said i liked the characters but the whole story was just too disappointing
<START> tashan the title itself explains the nature of the movie br br this type of movies are actually made for flop what a shame that <UNK> raj films produces such movies those are worthless than c grade movies or even some c grade movies have better and pleasing story than tashan the much hyped and over <UNK> promoted tashan poorly bombed at the box office which it certainly deserved br br in my view this is the worst movie ever made from <UNK> <UNK> raj <UNK> <UNK> how come they handled such a heavy project to new <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who has no actual sense of making action flick he tried to imitate <UNK> <UNK> ways of making like <UNK> but he suffered at last the action scenes are more like than comics or cartoon movies made for <UNK> the audiences br br the story also loses in its meaning and <UNK> to <UNK> win the <UNK> hearts in most scenes anil kapoor reminds me of southern <UNK> star <UNK> in his body languages and <UNK> expressions i am not a fan of neither saif nor akshay but the award of kareena should have finally gone to <UNK> hand instead of akshay just from the starting point i expected of it but at the end it <UNK> me with the climax truth saif is the main behind the whole adventure while akshay joins in the midst in any movie the final should be judged with the whole characters of the entire story and the award or say reward should be given to the one who deserves credit and tashan loses in this way and unexpectedly failed to become a hit br br <UNK> has nothing new to show off his comedian talent here but still reminds of his previous movies he seriously need to form a new image to his fans that would impress them again and again in between saif did a great job in race and now he returned again in his hilarious nature through this movie but he has fully developed himself in the acting field and last but not the least about kareena she looks really hot with bikini dress of which some complain as she became too lean but i myself don't think so instead she became slim yes slim it is a good factor for a female to attract the major people or say male beside them it is nice that <UNK> son <UNK> appears in the beginning last as young saif i hope now he too will lean forward in target of making acting as his career br br those who like this tashan they are either mentally <UNK> or still want to go back to childhood or say want to be admitted in an asylum thumbs down to <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> the project offered by <UNK> raj films in future he should experiment and study the script minimum of 5 years before going into practical directions br br sorry i don't like to rate good stars to this type of junk movies
<START> where do i begin i wanted to enjoy this movie and i did still i wanted to be able to enjoy it for being another zombie film that was worth my <UNK> and it <UNK> this was a different kind of enjoyment this was <UNK> a perverse glee that i <UNK> in watching one of the most ridiculous films id seen yet and i dont much care for whatever <UNK> excuses were there was no excuse for this film going how it went this was a bad film all the way around yet i still cant give it below a 4 out of ten which is what i gave it because well at least i was able to laugh at this <UNK> of a movie br br i had to imagine these zombies that were all over the <UNK> of these buildings everywhere had to imagine that they were either bored as hell so they <UNK> up on the <UNK> and <UNK> themselves high on stone <UNK> or they saw the <UNK> living <UNK> band of jerk offs coming around so they took it upon themselves to stage numerous <UNK> <UNK> hell what else is there to do when <UNK> dead br br i had to laugh at some zombies performing what looked to be martial arts <UNK> kicks and jumps and some <UNK> about like traditional <UNK> i <UNK> my eyes on a floating head that was never explained i watched in pure horrific delight as the land they were in the <UNK> was absolutely <UNK> in fog heavy doses of fog and that the <UNK> were as they were <UNK> castle <UNK> i had to even cringe when i saw that the design for a cure for this plague was <UNK> on a <UNK> as an <UNK> with lines <UNK> from each angle with dead one written in the middle i had to ask myself if the science of <UNK> zombies is that easy then i wonder if i could come up with a little something to start a zombie <UNK> here br br all in all the effects were overboard the dubbing horrid im sure the original acting as poor the story absurd the zombies inconsistent even in a bad way they <UNK> all been similar and the women ugly but i found myself enjoying this thing it was a fun watch it turned out to be a very very bad film and i would not recommend this thing unless one is into bad directorial exploitation films but still again i say it was worth a good laugh i <UNK> zombie films no matter what but when this had <UNK> name attached to it it <UNK> been much better let me dare say zombie holocaust was better
<START> i really must have caught a different film from the rest of the <UNK> on this site because at a screening of the film last night the audience was so <UNK> by the <UNK> that i'm not even kidding half walked out shot as if the filmmaker thought he were approaching some daring new territory by presenting a homosexual coming of age story the film <UNK> david lynch inspired visuals with fassbinder inspired acting the performances in this film are so dull and bored that i figured one of the actors was going to pass out by how uninspired they seemed to be by the script what's worse is that it's colored like an episode of miami vice i don't know who this director thinks he is maybe he has <UNK> of the surreal like <UNK> <UNK> etc but the problem is that all of the <UNK> mentioned directors display a level of <UNK> sensibility that is sorely lacking here i could understand the <UNK> of this film about ten years ago but when we've got masterpieces such as bad <UNK> mysterious skin and show me love why bother with this cinematic turd there is nothing new to be seen here
<START> tom <UNK> <UNK> br br aspect ratio 1 <UNK> 1 br br sound format <UNK> br br in late 19th century england young tom brown alex <UNK> is sent to the public school at <UNK> where he experiences the <UNK> of a radical new <UNK> stephen <UNK> and stands up to the <UNK> resident bully <UNK> joseph <UNK> br br already the subject of numerous screen adaptations most notably gordon <UNK> superior 1951 version thomas <UNK> <UNK> novel gets the early 21st century treatment courtesy of screenwriter ashley <UNK> tv's where the heart is and director david moore the <UNK> saga it's pleasant enough and watchable but it's also rather <UNK> and dull distinguished only by <UNK> sincere performance as the new principal determined to <UNK> away some of the <UNK> most dubious <UNK> and by the introduction of a possible new star in 14 year old <UNK> a talented kid with the kind of <UNK> charm and vivid good looks that should take him all the way to hollywood and beyond otherwise this is typical uk tv fodder the kind of stuff <UNK> by executives eager to fill the <UNK> with <UNK> product even one as thoroughly <UNK> as this the uk <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> described it as <UNK> odd and raised a <UNK> <UNK> over all of that <UNK> and brutality and a handsome <UNK> villain torturing the life out of sweet young boys quite
<START> not that much things happen in this movie but a lot of meanings the woman thought she had all that she can in life but that was indeed not true and she found out herself when she met this person who was <UNK> some research for his next job there really should be more types of movies like this im not even that old as considered mature im 13 by the way and i still got the idea and point of the film the main point is in my opinion don't think you can't have a better life just because you currently have this one br br though i got to admit i was thinking of watching another movie but after reading all the reviews and seen the trailer i decided on this one even though i knew not that much action would appear in the film i recommend anyone to watch this movie as it has very good points in the film and is a really good ending
<START> this movie is wonderful br br i was <UNK> i should say and surprised because of how uniquely it was done the cast the <UNK> the effects everything magnificent i mean it was a love story yes but what made it outstanding from the rest was that it was told in an entertaining wholesome manner br br for me it is the representation of modern fairy tale it's like the modern peter pan simply amazing br br i surely would buy a copy of this the moment it hit the market br br this movie is really a double must see one 10 stars for that
<START> steve carpenter cannot make horror movies first of all the casting was very wrong for this movie the only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from buffy the vampire <UNK> this movies has no gore usually a key <UNK> to a horror movie no action no acting and no suspense also a key <UNK> wes <UNK> is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that it's sad there were a few parts that were supposed to be funny continuing the teen horror comedy movies and no one laughed in the audience i thought that this movie was rated r and i didn't pay attention and realized it had been changed to pg 13 anyway see this movie if you liked i still know what you did last summer that's the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary and seriously this is to you steve carpenter stop making horror movies this movie makes scream look like texas chainsaw massacre
<START> i am a great fan of david lynch and have everything that he's made on dvd except for hotel room the 2 hour twin peaks movie so when i found out about this i immediately grabbed it and and what is this it's a bunch of <UNK> drawn black and white cartoons that are loud and foul mouthed and unfunny maybe i don't know what's good but maybe this is just a bunch of crap that was <UNK> on the public under the name of david lynch to make a few bucks too let me make it clear that i didn't care about the foul language part but had to keep <UNK> the sound because my neighbors might have all in all this is a highly disappointing release and may well have just been left in the <UNK> box set as a curiosity i highly recommend you don't spend your money on this 2 out of 10
<START> whoever wrote up <UNK> as a great car movie must be getting paid off by daniel <UNK> to promote this ultra crappy <UNK> steaming pile of amateur crap easily the worst <UNK> movie or any movie ever made this makes <UNK> look like citizen kane br br take every cheesy cliché out of an 80s action tv series put in some really crappy special effects and lame characters with no relevance and you have living proof that daniel <UNK> should not write screenplays and produce movies but should remain in the real estate business br br this is such a lame movie with such a lame plot and the most contrived action sequences ever what <UNK> me is not that the makers of this film are idiots but that they consider the movie going public to be idiots enough to fall for this crap
<START> near the closing stages of baby mama one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and <UNK> that it <UNK> all just a <UNK> i really couldn't say it any better than that and while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again the vast majority of what is present is too <UNK> to be considered relevant and too <UNK> to be worth anyone's time a <UNK> cast mundane script and vague caricature characters ensure that baby mama certainly isn't <UNK> on the ol' <UNK> but it never makes up for this through its <UNK> sense of humour <UNK> mainly of very routine cliché jokes based around an odd couple rich and poor trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world the film is far too <UNK> to deliver laughs outside its very thin <UNK> br br as a story on finding love it's not that bad but playing this plot line as a side story of sorts to work alongside the comedy <UNK> odd couple <UNK> characterisation is notably weak resulting in a <UNK> romance that never <UNK> as characters themselves both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their <UNK> so while we may eventually come to find the character's interactions with each other amusing at times the comedy never <UNK> beyond distant chuckles we don't feel for the characters and don't find them <UNK> interesting but rather their dynamic unfortunately however although this dynamic works best or at least better than the individual <UNK> as mentioned above it rarely <UNK> outside of the typical confines of the odd couple formula br br kate tina <UNK> is a successful business woman who has hired working class dumb blonde angie amy <UNK> to be her unlikely surrogate and after angie decides to leave hopeless husband carl <UNK> shepard both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences yes it's the typical odd couple premise and one that we have already seen in this year's what happens in vegas yet what baby mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi layered characters kate and angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air in fact the movie's only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of <UNK> <UNK> who gets <UNK> with playing a door man of the few times that i laughed during baby mama most of those moments were because of this man and the remainder usually fell to shepard br br it's a rare thing of course to find a movie which <UNK> its <UNK> themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera and yet director michael <UNK> goes from page to screen effectively enough yet for a film about babies multi million dollar business and cultural stereotyping this isn't necessarily a good thing baby mama is grade a hammy plastic <UNK> town with capital bore topped with sugar so not only did i feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two dimensional nature but i simply didn't care for the world they inhabited the dialogue along with sets costumes and the <UNK> general themes are painted in <UNK> blues and <UNK> so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director's <UNK> need to make his movie feel like a <UNK> fantasy these aren't characters and that isn't our world in any <UNK> so why should i care at the end of the day however a romantic <UNK> ultimate <UNK> of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests and the <UNK> of its laughs baby mama has little going on in any of these <UNK> of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair i'm sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings but anyone else will probably just feel <UNK> and probably bored in this respect baby mama avoids being unbearable but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience a comedic dud and a romantic <UNK> baby mama is too light headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining br br a review by jamie robert ward http www <UNK> net
<START> film starts in <UNK> japan in which a man <UNK> his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide it's a very gory bloody sequence then it jumps to present day well 1982 to be precise ted edward albert wife laura susan george and their annoying little kid move to japan for <UNK> work they rent a house and surprise surprise it just happens to be the house where the murders took place the three dead people are around as ghosts the makeup is hysterically bad and make life hell for the family br br sounds ok but it's really hopeless there's a bloody opening and ending and nothing happens in between there is an attack by giant <UNK> which is just <UNK> they look so fake i swear i saw the strings pulling one along and they're <UNK> there's a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes probably just to show off <UNK> body another one about 40 minutes later but that was necessary to the plot and a really silly <UNK> towards the end the fight scene between albert and doug <UNK> must be seen to be believed br br as for acting albert was ok as the husband and <UNK> was pretty good as a family friend but george as always is terrific in a lousy film she gives this film a much needed lift but can't save it i'm giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing that aside this is a very boring film
<START> corbin bernsen gives a <UNK> intense and riveting performance as dr alan feinstone a wealthy and successful beverly hills dentist who's obsessed with perfection when he discovers that his lovely blonde babe <UNK> wife has been cheating on him and the irs start <UNK> him about tax problems feinstone cracks under the pressure and goes violently around the bend director brian <UNK> working from a suitably dark witty and demented script by stuart gordon dennis <UNK> and charles <UNK> exposes the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> underneath the <UNK> clean well <UNK> surface of respectable <UNK> rich america with deliciously <UNK> glee moreover <UNK> further <UNK> up the grisly goings on with a <UNK> twisted sense of pitch black <UNK> humor bernsen positively shines as dr feinstone he expertly projects a truly unnerving underlying creepiness that's right beneath <UNK> <UNK> calm and assured <UNK> the supporting cast are likewise excellent linda hoffman as <UNK> bitchy <UNK> wife brooke earl <UNK> as smarmy <UNK> irs agent marvin goldblum molly <UNK> as <UNK> assistant jessica patty toy as <UNK> assistant karen jan <UNK> as jolly office manager candy <UNK> <UNK> as sweet <UNK> teenager sarah ken <UNK> as <UNK> no nonsense detective <UNK> tony <UNK> as <UNK> equally <UNK> partner detective sunshine michael <UNK> as <UNK> stud <UNK> pool <UNK> matt and mark <UNK> as on the make <UNK> steve <UNK> the first rate make up f x are every bit as gory gross and <UNK> as they ought to be the polished cinematography by <UNK> <UNK> boasts lots of great crazy <UNK> camera angles and a few tasty zoom in close ups alan <UNK> spirited <UNK> score also hits the flesh <UNK> spot an <UNK> <UNK> treat
<START> this film is advertised as a clever romantic comedy it is neither clever nor romantic and it is definitely not an effective comedy the <UNK> of the well meaning yet pathetic character tom <UNK> from one extremely embarrassing disaster to another the only saving <UNK> are the competent performance by toni <UNK> and the <UNK> with which we glimpse <UNK> pleasant face overall to be avoided
<START> this film was horrible the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real world the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film school br br i do not recommend this film to anyone who a knows any detail about the world of police or <UNK> <UNK> b knows any detail about film making or appreciation br br i do recommend this film to the average or below average mind i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber if you must watch this film on a full mind i highly recommend some kind of <UNK> br br it is a total waste of what little production value it has
<START> sometimes a film comes along that is unique the <UNK> <UNK> is one such film the <UNK> <UNK> is like no other film i have ever seen unfortunately for the <UNK> <UNK> myself it's unique for different reasons than what the filmmakers had originally intended read on all shall hopefully become clear the <UNK> <UNK> as it's <UNK> know although it was apparently filmed under the title the <UNK> starts with some extremely dull shots of an american town somewhere streets <UNK> that sort of thing as the opening credits play when the <UNK> <UNK> begins proper we the viewer that is are introduced to a real loser named joe <UNK> carl <UNK> who is in his 40's he lives on his own in a crappy little apartment where he watches t v eats <UNK> <UNK> dog food <UNK> to old <UNK> records as he dances with a blow up rubber sex doll joe likes teenage girls he has various porn magazines but enjoys the real thing even more however being an ugly <UNK> joe can't <UNK> any young ladies to go out with him or do anything else with him for that matter one <UNK> day an old homeless vietnam vet <UNK> <UNK> sees the agony pain that joe has to go through actually he sees joe being spoken to by the cops for <UNK> a teenage girl decides to help him out he tells joe about an <UNK> that he learned from the <UNK> in vietnam that will <UNK> <UNK> appearance into whatever he likes a process he calls <UNK> but at the same time he warns joe that <UNK> makes you crazy if you do it too <UNK> that night joe decides to give it a try in a public place on a <UNK> for some reason joe says a few words does an extremely silly dance starts <UNK> joe finishes off by <UNK> london bridge is falling down listen yeah i ain't making this up either at first joe is <UNK> disappointed when nothing significant happens to <UNK> himself joe tries to buy a porn <UNK> but is shocked when the clerk kevin <UNK> refuses to sell it to an <UNK> girl joe the bright spark that he is realises what has happened talks his her way out of it by claiming his her dad had sent him her to buy it joe who now calls his alter ego <UNK> ann <UNK> senses the possibilities heads straight for the local high school joe befriends four teenage girls jennifer armstrong laura <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tracy <UNK> <UNK> m <UNK> brenda <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> while under his disguise oh joe manages to become a <UNK> at the school simply by asking the sports teacher miss van dyke <UNK> <UNK> at first joe seems harmless enough he just likes to hang around the girls <UNK> stuff like that but things soon change as joe brutally murders brenda <UNK> dad vince armstrong edward <UNK> is a detective so along with his partner ed simpson clyde <UNK> walt spencer bruce <UNK> the <UNK> is determined to catch the <UNK> responsible for killing his daughter's friends but will they succeed before joe strikes again the imdb listing for the <UNK> <UNK> is wrong i watched it mere hours ago it clearly states that it's directed by mark <UNK> who was also a co producer definitely not patrick j <UNK> who was credited as a co producer the cinematographer not that it makes much difference i'd have though that <UNK> would have been more than happy for <UNK> to take the <UNK> for making this piece of crap no one involved in the making of the <UNK> <UNK> should be allowed to go anywhere near a camera again ever the <UNK> <UNK> is easily one of the worst films i've ever seen that's saying something it's absolutely terrible in every possible way imaginable the script by steven <UNK> is atrocious there's no narrative structure excitement tension drama character development the things that do happen are so mind numbingly dumb it's untrue the plot devices chain of events in the <UNK> <UNK> are totally incomprehensible the scene where joe finds out the prostitute steven andrews he hired is in fact a man joe starts to chase him around his apartment with two <UNK> <UNK> is simply jaw dropping stuff the subsequent scene when the <UNK> reports the incident to the police is hilariously written had me <UNK> laughing at the dialogue i hated the ending as well not only was it predictable but it leaves the door open for a sequel i <UNK> <UNK> at the mere thought on a technical level the <UNK> <UNK> is awful point hope photography bland inappropriate music forgettable locations poorly edited brenda is killed in the kitchen yet her blood <UNK> on the t v screen that was clearly in the opposite room some of the worst acting i've sat through very unimpressive special effects which consist of a few cut off rubber fingers a <UNK> throat a quick scene where joe eats some flesh it comes as no surprise that the cast crew who worked on the <UNK> <UNK> have virtually no imdb credits for anything before or after even at <UNK> odd minutes the <UNK> <UNK> is far to long really boring to sit through i could go on on all day long about how bad the <UNK> <UNK> is i really could one thing i can't quite work out is was all this intentional by the filmmakers the <UNK> <UNK> is indeed a unique film unique in it's awfulness incompetence in the the case of the <UNK> <UNK> i hope it remains unique too having said that it's still not the worst film i've ever seen but it comes close that's for sure definitely one to avoid
<START> riff <UNK> is a wildly obsessed fan of the rock group the ramones and so are most of the students in the school but a new <UNK> of a principal ms <UNK> thinks rock <UNK> roll is a bad influence on the students especially the music from the ramones so when riff finds out they're performing in town she <UNK> class for a couple of days to get tickets for herself and her friends but when ms <UNK> discovers why she really took those days off she <UNK> the tickets while this is happening tom roberts is totally love struck over riff but <UNK> friend kate <UNK> feels the same way about tom but riff has her eyes set only on the lead singer joe <UNK> and hopefully in getting to that concert to get them to play her song br br fun fun fun yep that's right <UNK> n roll high <UNK> doesn't drift away from it main <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> romp it wasn't what i was expecting that's for sure everyone <UNK> in this dandy project looks like they're having a great time and the relaxing nature of it shows on screen with the energy providing such a glowing spirit which makes it a priceless experience that's not to say i think its art and the plot is as pointless as can be but watching this <UNK> crazy ride that <UNK> into some good harmless high <UNK> i just couldn't wipe the grin off my face it's tacky very cheesy <UNK> chaotic but damn it's funky <UNK> br br this low budget b grade feature from producer roger corman and john <UNK> who was co writer and plus he co directed some scenes when director allan <UNK> was <UNK> on the last day shoot is basically a glorious homage on the <UNK> 1950s flicks by sticking with the <UNK> clichés and throwing into the <UNK> the teenage rebellion tag because of the generation gap between them and the adults who always know best these features might not be particularly fresh but they do rack up some appeal because of the <UNK> gusto treatment the film has just one thing on mind to go out on a bang and they manage to do that courtesy of 'the <UNK> who play themselves really you could say its one big trendy video clip since it's all about the <UNK> well most of it anyway i see a lot <UNK> towards the <UNK> acting ability these are musicians not actors which means it's not about their acting here it's the music we're suppose to dig they're here to perform which they deliver in that front with some kick ass tracks that <UNK> the film to create a totally upbeat vibe especially their flamboyant concert performances the <UNK> soundtrack also had some killer tunes from some other artists such as <UNK> the <UNK> underground <UNK> <UNK> mack eddie and the hot <UNK> and alice cooper but these jumping tracks <UNK> in well with the <UNK> feel and even the score was worked in rather well especially in the scenes involving ms <UNK> with the score <UNK> the right mood that <UNK> her mind set the playful mood of the film is pretty much like a roller coaster ride with such a <UNK> pace between the <UNK> tunes and comical segments ranging from scattered slapstick routines to it's sometimes clever tongue in cheek dialogue thrown in for good measure is a variety of light and heavy gags which i found very <UNK> and it gave it such a wider range to express itself br br what else gave the film an added boost had to be the divine <UNK> soles better known for her performance in halloween who gave such a bang up performance as the <UNK> riff <UNK> other <UNK> performances were <UNK> young as the extremely cute kate <UNK> vincent van <UNK> as the <UNK> tom roberts and the go to man <UNK> who's <UNK> played by clint howard also some top <UNK> corman <UNK> pop up with great send up performances by mary <UNK> who's excellent as the demanding ms <UNK> who's pushing her unfair reign on the students paul <UNK> as mr <UNK> and a small support role from dick <UNK> towards the end the enthusiastic acting is pretty campy but that goes down well with the material and there's a certain <UNK> <UNK> from these characters but we totally despise ms <UNK> and her hall <UNK> <UNK> br br there's no beating around the bush here when i say <UNK> <UNK> roll high <UNK> is an <UNK> hoot of a <UNK> time
<START> this is quite a dull movie well shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from depardieu as a <UNK> and bad boy with realistic locations mood and art house <UNK> all over it fails because the director takes no position stand or critical commentary on the topic he <UNK> one of <UNK> <UNK> and regular working partner on films with depardieu i believe they made 7 together <UNK> fails to engage it seems to be a <UNK> on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good hearted husband around isabelle <UNK> who plays the <UNK> with <UNK> distinction offers <UNK> answers like i don't know i like his arms i like the way he makes love to her <UNK> husband who tries to kick her out of the house but <UNK> and <UNK> because i assume he loves her so he accepts and hope for what that she will one day wake up and come to her senses things like this are not answered in <UNK> condescending <UNK> drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that don't add up i know the answers do not add up but please take a stand jules et jim this is not the final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a <UNK> and headache only to the most <UNK>
<START> br br i saw this on the sci fi channel it came on right after the first one for some reason this movie kept me interested i don't know why stop asking br br spoilers okay it was cheesy how this guy got involved with the making of the movie in the first movie he had a reason to kill people but in this <UNK> half of the killings attempted killings were <UNK> for no reason stanley killed the director due to creative differences he captured the co writer due to creative differences but what was the deal with trying to kill off the cast no cast no movie he wanted it to look real when they died if this was supposed to be such a high budget movie use the special effects man of course like the first one the captured girl gets away and stanley ends up getting messed up and <UNK> <UNK> sarcasm this movie had potential and the saddest thing of all the really sad part i would watch a cabin by the lake 3 only because i like judd nelson and he's the only good part about this <UNK>
<START> when people ask me why do i like movies so much i usually respond have you seen the art gallery sequence in de palma's dressed to kill that scene alone pretty much represents everything i want to see in a film if i was a film director that would be the kind of thing i'd like to do pure cinema is one way of describing that sequence and it is truly amazing to see how director de palma's entire movie works at the same high artistic <UNK> of that scene it is a dream like movie clever as hell and with more <UNK> and intelligence than a dozen films put together i think the movie raises an important point that will always be a topic of <UNK> discussion could a movie rely solely on technique and still be considered an artistic success the film has no message to speak of acting is great but it is at the service of the style and the script is short on logic de palma's movie makes a really good case that style when handled properly can sustain a feature length film sure michael caine angie dickinson nancy allen and keith gordon give <UNK> performances but this is a director's movie all the way to the <UNK> it is a sensational <UNK> of the possibilities of the film medium i won't tell you what hitchcock movie the film pays homage to i don't want to spoil any surprises but i think de palma <UNK> the story's arc and he manages to create a film that pretty much <UNK> his entire career not for the faint of heart
<START> there will be a time where kids will have grown up without ever seeing the one and only bugs bunny kiss technically another man on the lips there will be a time where it won't be duck or rabbit season there will be a time where the <UNK> devil will be dubbed politically incorrect br br but so help me now is not that time br br nobody really wants an <UNK> version of our beloved loony characters whoever it is in marketing who comes up with corn nuts corn gone wrong and extreme <UNK> and evidently this <UNK> turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or whatever doesn't mean they know jack about kids br br i think that they're doing a <UNK> to children <UNK> them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows of all time this show <UNK> me and it's not just the dated artwork or terrible dialogue they <UNK> good voice talent like phil <UNK> michael clarke <UNK> <UNK> milo and so many others it lacks style humor character development and most importantly heart br br the show like it's <UNK> characters slam <UNK> <UNK> runner ace bunny is but a shadow of it's former timeless and beautiful self
<START> a pleasant surprise i expected a further <UNK> along the line the rock 9 con air 7 <UNK> 4 especially for such an <UNK> film perhaps that's the reason so few <UNK> of this new type of bruckheimer fare clever dialogue instead of snappy one liners decent background motivation instead of shake n <UNK> stereotypes and when the chase came you really <UNK> for it <UNK> expecting an <UNK> <UNK> stay away this is one for the more intelligent action fans it didn't even bother me jolie appeared so little
<START> i saw this movie during a <UNK> themed <UNK> class during my <UNK> year of college i was <UNK> unfortunately close to the screen and my professor chose me to serve as a <UNK> boy everyone else was laughing but they weren't within constant <UNK> br br let's get it out of the way the peter jackson <UNK> of the <UNK> films do owe something to the bakshi film in jackson's version of the <UNK> of the ring for instance the scene in which the black riders assault the empty <UNK> <UNK> is almost a complete <UNK> copy of the scene in bakshi's film shot by shot you could call this <UNK> or homage depending on your agenda br br i'm sure the similarities don't stop there i'm not going to do any research to find out what they are because that would imply i have some <UNK> of respect for this film i'm sure others have <UNK> the similarities look around br br this movie is a complete train wreck in every sense of the metaphor and many many people died in the accident i've decided to list what i can remember in a more or less <UNK> fashion if i've left out anything else that offended me it's because i'm completely overwhelmed confronted with a wealth of failure and at high points mediocrity br br due to heavy use of <UNK> <UNK> is no longer a gentle wise wizard but a wildly <UNK> prophet of doom whose hat inexplicably changes color once or twice during the course of the film br br <UNK> the white is sometimes referred to as <UNK> during the film without explanation he wears purple and red for some mysterious reason br br sam is flat out hideous the portrayal of his friendship with <UNK> is strangely <UNK> and unsatisfying yes <UNK> are small like children but they are not children br br merry and <UNK> are never introduced they simply appear during a scene change with a one sentence explanation the film is filled with sloppy editing like this br br <UNK> sam <UNK> and merry are singing <UNK> as they skip through along the road one of the <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> at least twice as large as he is from behind his back which was not visible before and begins <UNK> in typical fantasy <UNK> fashion as they all break into la la la s awful br br <UNK> apparently is a native american dressed in an extremely stereotypical fantasy <UNK> no pants complete with huge square <UNK> belt <UNK> he is arguably the worst <UNK> in the entire movie <UNK> he gets one <UNK> swing in before being knocked flat on his ass br br the black riders appear more like <UNK> than menacing <UNK> of evil they limp everywhere they go at a painfully slow pace this is disturbing to be sure but not frightening br br the scene before the black riders attempt to cross the ford of <UNK> in which they stare at <UNK> who is on the other side on <UNK> goes on forever during which time the riders rear their horses in a vaguely threatening manner and do nothing else the scene was probably intended to illustrate <UNK> <UNK> decline as he <UNK> to his wound it turns out to be more plodding than anything else br br <UNK> the dwarf is just as tall as <UNK> the <UNK> he's a dwarf there is simply no excuse for that he also looks like a <UNK> david the <UNK> it's a crude but accurate description br br <UNK> appears to have <UNK> elmer <UNK> golden <UNK> armor from that bugs bunny opera episode he looks ridiculous br br despite the similarity to <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> is <UNK> inducing and the least threatening villain in the entire film it looks like someone wearing pink bedroom <UNK> and it's barely <UNK> than <UNK> <UNK> may prefer this <UNK> but i'll take jackson's version any day br br the battle scenes are awkward and embarrassing almost none of the characters display any level of <UNK> with their <UNK> i'm not asking for action packed scenes like those in jackson's film but they are supposed to be fighting br br <UNK> makes a very short appearance and i was sorry he bothered to show up at all watch the film you'll see what i mean br br alright now for the good parts of the film br br some of the voice acting is pretty good it isn't that <UNK> sounds bad he just looks kind of like the jolly green giant br br <UNK> is somewhat interesting in this portrayal like tom <UNK> she seems <UNK> to the <UNK> powers of temptation and her voice actress isn't horrible either br br <UNK> death isn't as heart wrenching as in jackson's portrayal of the same scene but it's still appropriately dramatic and more true to his death in the book though i don't believe jackson made a mistake shooting it the way he did br br as my professor pointed out between <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> mainly at <UNK> deep if i'm correct resemble the war <UNK> corpses of soldiers a political statement that works pretty well if you realize what's being attempted br br while this isn't really a positive point about the film bakshi can't be blamed for the majority of the failures in this movie or so i've been told the project was on a tight budget and late in its production he lost creative control to some of the higher ups who i'm sure hadn't read the books br br let me be clear i respect bakshi for even attempting something of this <UNK> i simply have a hard time believing he was happy with the final product br br overall i cannot in any way recommend this <UNK> adaptation of <UNK> classic trilogy even for laughs unless you've already read the books and have your own <UNK> of the characters places and events i'm sure somebody somewhere will pick a copy of this up in confusion if you do keep an open mind and <UNK> what good you can from it
<START> note i couldn't force myself to actually write up a <UNK> review of prom night it just can't be done instead i went through what i thought about while watching the movie br br things that i thought about while watching prom night br br i'm so tired of those dreams where these elaborate deaths will take place only for the main character to wake up right before she bites it of course when i say elaborate deaths i mean off screen throat <UNK> or stabs in the stomach didn't the whole it's just a dream thing get ruined by dallas speaking of which i wonder if a couple stabs in the gut will cause immediate death br br the film is only ten minutes into and i can already count the horror clichés on two hands not a good sign br br even after just meeting the <UNK> boyfriend i'm convinced he will die anybody want to place <UNK> br br the killer in this movie is a teacher that is obsessed with the main character donna by the way does anybody think that donna is a horrible name for a main character in a horror film he spends three years in a maximum security prison before breaking out and finds donna celebrating her high school prom while there is no <UNK> for taste i seriously wonder who would take all that time to stalk somebody as dull as donna br br high schools allow <UNK> to take place at <UNK> and doesn't keep track of the students apparently students are perfectly able to buy a hotel room and go in and out as they please i suppose if this plot point wasn't in place the movie would be 90 minutes of people being bored out of their mind and randomly biting the dust whenever they go to the bathroom i suppose the trade off for their excitement is my utter boredom with everything i've already played count the pieces of <UNK> bubble <UNK> under the seat and guess how much money i have in my <UNK> and i'm only in the 20 minute mark how else will i entertain myself br br note to self don't forget milk and bread on the way home br br dear screenwriter you've used up enough false scares to get through this movie and every other horror remake this year br br the 1980 version of this film wasn't that good but compared to this remake it was like citizen kane or at least the godfather it had jamie lee curtis in one of her many post halloween horror flicks and it did have a little twist at the end i miss jamie lee i wish she'd act more br br apparently at prom there isn't much dancing going on instead the girls get in fights with their boyfriends over where they plan to attend college i hear all these <UNK> being brought up by name and i can't help but wonder who these girls have to cheat off of on the entrance <UNK> to get in br br the killer must carry a bag of really effective cleaning supplies and <UNK> up his mess between scenes that's the only logical explanation for why he could stab somebody to death on the carpet or in the bathroom and by the time somebody goes up to the hotel room there is no trace of a struggle on another side note this is a very lazy killer michael myers went hunting after his victims just saying br br it's official the entire audience in the theater is rooting on the killer what <UNK> it was it whenever donna went back up to her hotel room while <UNK> were going off <UNK> everybody to exit the building was it her constant dreams and how even after going through something dramatic in said dream she insisted on <UNK> her steps to a <UNK> or was it <UNK> <UNK> unconvincing performance i'll have to say it was all of the above br br okay who had he dies off screen in the third act you win the pot br br finally the movie is over my friend turns to me and says donna wasn't too smart that's the understatement of the week kind of like saying that a <UNK> is a small <UNK> of wind or a week long power <UNK> is a slight <UNK> br br i can't wait to get on rotten tomatoes and see if anybody gave this move a <UNK> review br br i can't recommend this i refuse to recommend this this is as lazy of a horror film as any and the only way to enjoy its cheese <UNK> plot is if you are under the influence of at least ten beers and unfortunately for theater <UNK> alcohol isn't served br br rating out of
<START> as a another reviewer states <UNK> war is an outstanding film about an outstanding person <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who would become the jewish joan of arc unfortunately i <UNK> in opinion not <UNK> that miss <UNK> as the lead is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter in truth for me her performance is not held back by her beauty but makes it all the more stark in the terror of the sadistic brutality as a <UNK> she faces <UNK> <UNK> performance is brave poignant heartfelt or understood and totally believable in other words for me in the zone from the opening credits if you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something they believe in and be <UNK> entertained give <UNK> war with <UNK> <UNK> a try my hat is off also to ellen <UNK> as <UNK> mother a much well known and famous actress who could have made effort to walk off with the film in that it is a team effort perhaps of two <UNK> but not an all about eve situation
<START> there are three movies with this animation style that i <UNK> remember from my youth this movie the last <UNK> flight of dragons and the <UNK> i own copies of both dragons and the <UNK> both excellent and i hadn't seen the last <UNK> in more than a decade that was until today and now i wish i hadn't what bothered me the most was the script it was incredibly choppy and often inane things would happen for no reason and other things would happen without explanation we're not just talking about little things here either we're talking about key plot points the story itself isn't that great to begin with but it could have worked had the script been decent not even close on top of that the music was awful i know that music in movies such as these rarely have what one would call classic pieces but the music in this movie made me want to knock myself unconscious with a <UNK> ball this was one of those films that i was going to show to my kids some day but it just got cut i don't think i could ever sit through that crap fest again disappointed is putting it mildly
<START> a series of shorts <UNK> dumb tv shows groove tube hits and misses a lot overall i do really like this movie unfortunately a couple of the segments are totally boring a few really great clips make up for this a predecessor to such classics like kentucky fried movie
<START> i am a huge fan of simon pegg and have watched plenty of his movies until now and none of them have <UNK> to make me laugh neither did how to lose friends and alienate people br br this movie is essentially about a man good as <UNK> people off however he has an <UNK> set of <UNK> that <UNK> him from doing things that might just make him famous but in the end he ends up doing them the culture of life br br the movie is well toned with humor romance good acting and also a bit of a lap dance its one of those movies where you could just be happy when it ends
<START> this film is like an allegory of the <UNK> it has such direct honesty and innocence you can not possibly believe it was made after the world war when italy was <UNK> and <UNK> and was filled with a huge homeless <UNK> population it is a <UNK> to the best qualities of the human spirit as well as to the endless creative resources of that land of inspiration br br <UNK> is a character like <UNK> idiot a modern christ finding his way in a big city he is goodness and <UNK> <UNK> by love and his acts change the people he encounters as much as the miracle working <UNK> the story is told in a natural manner and simple style yet <UNK> with a magic that is almost a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> fantasies it is one of the most inspiring uplifting movies ever made
<START> i also having endured hundreds of children's movies in the past consider this to be one of the worst i have ever seen br br 1 i <UNK> in this day and age having to explain to my children that russia is not the bad guys also that mocking russian names like <UNK> is inappropriate br br 2 the grandfather <UNK> birthday party scene contained a quasi sexist joke in which he implied that males drink beer and women talk on the phone two other flies also needlessly use the word crap twice br br 3 the whole movie largely <UNK> of 1950's stereotypes and propaganda that i thought we as a nation were proud to have <UNK> above br br in all it's just crude badly animated even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to view
<START> the pros of this film are the astonishing fighting scenes absolutely incredible sword moves and martial art show off a true john woo masterpiece the story tends to be a bit week though but it never <UNK> the overwhelming display of <UNK> martial art action if you are into martial art movies you are going to love this one
<START> beautiful and touching movie rich colors great settings good acting and one of the most charming movies i have seen in a while i never saw such an interesting setting when i was in china my wife liked it so much she asked me to <UNK> on and rate it so other would enjoy too
<START> sometimes it takes a film making master like kubrick to bring that extra little something that unique <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> that transforms a great movie or a great script into a masterpiece one for the ages br br it's not just that stephen king's story has enough meat and <UNK> making it difficult for even the most <UNK> of directors to miss heck even king himself didn't fare so bad it's how kubrick <UNK> king's universe how he transforms the page into screen time that <UNK> the shining both a visual feast and a <UNK> <UNK> in directing br br kubrick's miss en scene is as usually terrific the movie progresses with a <UNK> sharp lively pace even though it's neither fast nor heavily edited and it <UNK> at no less than <UNK> minutes the camera <UNK> through the lavish corridors of the overlook hotel like it is some kind of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for exploration linear tracking shots exposing the <UNK> <UNK> interiors in all their <UNK> there's a <UNK> and <UNK> approach in how kubrick <UNK> space that reminds me very much of how japanese directors worked in the sixties as if what is depicted is <UNK> to how all the different elements are balanced inside the frame br br certain images definitely stand out the first shot of jack's <UNK> accompanied off screen from the <UNK> of a ball like drums of doom coming from some other floor or produced by the <UNK> itself as though it is an <UNK> of doom all by itself later on proving to be nothing short of just that a red river flowing through the <UNK> <UNK> in slow motion jack hitting the door with the axe the camera moving along with him tracking the action as it happens instead of remaining static as though it's the camera <UNK> through the door and not the axe the ultra fast zoom in the kid's face <UNK> us inside his head before we see the two dead girls from his <UNK> and of course the bathroom scene br br much has been said of jack <UNK> <UNK> overacting his mad is not entirely successful because well he's jack nicholson the guy looks half mad anyway playing mad turns him into an exaggerated caricature of himself shelley duvall on the other hand is one of the most inspired casting choices kubrick ever had coming from a streak of fantastic performances for robert altman in the seventies 3 women thieves like us <UNK> she brings to her character the right amounts of <UNK> and emotional distress a terrific and very underrated actress
<START> in a time when the <UNK> and principals the united states were <UNK> on are <UNK> <UNK> by an administration desperate to distract attention from its own internal problems where the <UNK> convention human rights and foreign <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> a thriller about the state taking illegal action that far <UNK> that of the terrorists they are <UNK> might seem appropriate however if you want to see a film about that try ed <UNK> flawed the siege instead because <UNK> is one of the most <UNK> <UNK> thrillers ever made like robert altman's <UNK> a porter the director has taken on a subject he seems completely ignorant of and <UNK> his ignorance on almost every frame br br his terrorists are a wildly unconvincing group of stereotypes <UNK> <UNK> dresses as if he were <UNK> for mad <UNK> <UNK> vs <UNK> strip michel <UNK> behaves like an absurd kids in the hall send up of the <UNK> professor from hell <UNK> <UNK> a cardboard middle class revolutionary wannabe who behave at every unconvincing plot turn as if they want to be caught the corrupt authorities fare a little better but are still painted in <UNK> broad <UNK> br br it is possible to make a smart film about dumb people <UNK> election but this is a moronic film about dumb people made by people who think they're <UNK> who are talking down to the masses in truth were one to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> with jim <UNK> johnny <UNK> and shannon <UNK> the result would actually be to raise the intellectual content of the film not lower it br br <UNK> might just have got away with his characters and events if he took them seriously but his staging is so inept the fight scenes would embarrass a <UNK> class while the shooting of the kidnapping is more inept than the kidnapping itself and his inability to get his cast to perform with at least some <UNK> of <UNK> human behaviour so blatant that it is actually embarrassing to watch special mention must be made here of <UNK> so very good in <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> he is stunningly bad here in a performance that is so far over the top it's back again br br <UNK> has made some fine films but you would never guess it from this amateurish mess a newcomer to his work would never want to see another of his films after this which would be a great shame utter drivel and a sad waste of a potentially interesting material one star out of ten and that's being very generous
<START> i agree with those reviews i have read here and i have no words to define such a turkey like this but despite everything i still can find a reason for movies like this to exist do you <UNK> those happy days in which video was a <UNK> business and a lot of movies were made with the only reason of filling the shelves of the video stores this movie comes from that period and i can imagine that was the only reason for which it was produced and the same happened with many many many other <UNK> do you remember rambo <UNK> and so many slashers of z grade i still feel nostalgia for that period about this movie i can say i <UNK> waste my time watching it because i pressed the fast forward button after the first fifteen minutes just to find a very funny scene in which a guy was pushing an axe against heads which <UNK> because as you perfectly notice they were made of plastic and about the end well it was so badly filmed i could not understand what happened <UNK> the same i had not followed the non existing plot at all but boy video age was a great age despite movies like this
<START> this movie was terrible to say the least i was hoping for a lot better after seeing high school musical the whole entire movie was a complete rip off of the simple life only it wasn't a reality show br br the acting was not good at all amanda <UNK> had her moments when she wasn't that terrible on the other hand <UNK> <UNK> was bad all the way through chris <UNK> who played the love interest of amanda was playing a french guy but had an awful accent one good thing about this movie was the completely adorable michael <UNK> who played <UNK> love interest just something to keep in mind if this movie had been aired before high school musical it probably would not have seemed as bad but it was no comparison br br overall i give it a 2
<START> there are so many stupid moments in <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> of death <UNK> that you really wonder if it's a spoof at times it felt like i was watching a sequel to kung <UNK> rather than a bruce lee film br br to be honest this film has <UNK> all to do with <UNK> of <UNK> if anything it's more a sequel remake of <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> many elements of that film particularly the actual footage bruce lee's character billy lo apparently <UNK> the sudden death of his friend and encounters a piece of film that was left with the man's daughter when the body is stolen during the funeral billy is also killed and it's up to his <UNK> brother to avenge both men's deaths br br <UNK> long stars as brother bobby lo and doesn't really have the sort of charisma to carry the film his fighting abilities are very good however bruce lee obviously turns up thanks to no longer deleted footage simply to cash in on the legacy saying that on the whole the footage is actually edited in better than in <UNK> of <UNK> but it doesn't stop the film from being a mess br br ok so the fights are actually very entertaining dare i say mind blowing and make the film at least watchable but there are so many <UNK> elements to this film that it really <UNK> your patience first off there's the supposed villain who lives on his <UNK> estate or is that mental institution seriously the <UNK> eats raw <UNK> drinks <UNK> blood carries a monkey on his shoulder and owns some <UNK> and lions this attempt to make him look tough and intelligent just makes you feel sorry for him you half expect someone to <UNK> him back to his room br br in fact this middle section is awful and when the scene involving a naked hooker and a lion suit arrived i turned it off however i did finish the film and was kind of glad i did because the fight scene towards the end much like <UNK> was the whole reason for watching while the story is an embarrassment the action is very good and contains excellent choreography br br but even the finale disappoints if the premise was anything to go by what we were told was that the <UNK> of <UNK> was a <UNK> that was upside down and underground this sounded great like a twist on bruce lee's original idea with different styles of fighting on each level could this be the <UNK> of <UNK> that was originally planned no the film should have been named <UNK> room of death because thats as far as the tower goes of yes there were indeed one or two <UNK> styles there were foil clad <UNK> <UNK> skinned henchman and stupid monk it's as though enter the dragon had never been made with the plot being a poor imitation br br worth watching once for the fast paced fight scenes but so stupid sometimes that it hurts if this was intended then fine thumbs up however for <UNK> that <UNK> room scene from <UNK> the <UNK>
<START> i'm giving this movie a 1 because there are no negative numbers in imdb rating system this movie was horrible it was very badly acted the story was poorly written the action was unbelievable i doubt even the salvation army could battle as poorly as the troops did in this film i won't even write any plot spoilers because the movie just isn't good enough for plot spoilers to write comments on the plot would be pointless if i were to compare this movie i'd have to compare it to reign of fire however although i didn't like reign of fire either that movie at least was better than this one br br some of the people in the theater left before the movie was even halfway done the only reason i didn't was because i simply didn't think to do it i was hoping for a feast of cgi and fighting masterfully done but that isn't what happened the martial arts lasted all of 30 seconds and that was from an exercise routine done during the flash back scene very disappointing the cgi was not done well either one scene comes to mind during one of the earlier tank battles the troops are firing away at nothing someone forgot to cue the animation guys on that bit of film so the street was totally devoid of bad guys i'm also thinking the bad guy's voice was dubbed by the voice over of <UNK> from the mummy movies had that same <UNK> <UNK> thing going on someone <UNK> some <UNK> here since i mentioned the fight scene i'll say yeah that might be considered a spoiler but only to the <UNK> i suppose br br don't go see it don't buy the dvd when it comes out either you have been warned
<START> typical thriller has been done many times before simple plot outline cop liotta becomes obsessed with <UNK> wife and he tries to <UNK> off good ol' kurt so he can have her this is beyond predictable it doesn't even try to make you guess the plot is the plot and there's no thinking outside the box here i guess then the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops but nothing is done originally or interestingly there's not really anything to say about this film it's not particularly bad but there's no good points either russell plays russell and you know what you're gonna get when you see him in a film <UNK> liotta <UNK> has an annoying cher <UNK> voice i read the plot outline and i could see the film in my head it was so obvious and basic i watched it and it rolled out in front of my eyes exactly as i had imagined i felt not a drop of emotion throughout i have no feeling towards this film it's as if i never even watched it considering this it's a pretty pointless film isn't it still i'll give it 3 10 for some reason
<START> i'm the sort of person who went down to the local library and read books on <UNK> difference engine whilst my <UNK> were playing football etc so if there is any such thing as a target audience for this film then i guess i'd probably be included in that br br maybe i just need to watch it again a previous reviewer mentioned not to watch this film whilst being tired maybe that was my mistake br br i tried my best to enjoy this film and there are aspects of it that i do like but overall i found it amateurish and quite plodding br br being somewhat of a self <UNK> computer nerd i just can't help but pick up on the exact time frame when the movie was actually made and how the employed graphics reflect that time i e 1997 having played games of the era c f mind <UNK> to <UNK> one example this film cannot escape that 16 bit colour low <UNK> <UNK> explosion of that time now thankfully this has somewhat <UNK> in more recent years in the <UNK> world at least in favour of actual game play br br having to resort to watching this movie via a german <UNK> satellite channel as i don't think it's ever been aired on uk <UNK> tv well not recently anyway i was mildly amused to see the end credits note <UNK> god dog had 4 people working on it's design maybe it's mean spirited of me to be amused by this given that ten years have <UNK> since the movie was made nevertheless the end result makes movie graphics from the eighties look good by comparison br br but as for the main story i agree that the format isn't the best idea like others i agree that <UNK> deserves a film without the sci fi angle and a more straightforward <UNK> approach would perhaps be better suited to covering the life story of this remarkable lady br br there are fundamental mistakes that <UNK> my enjoyment of this movie first of all the underlying idea that somehow lost real world information from the past can be accurately <UNK> through some sort of <UNK> via <UNK> based intelligent agents seems somehow ludicrous br br also the theme running through the movie that a <UNK> device can indeed predict the <UNK> of all things through the course of time e g the winds is now known not to be the case br br ok so the <UNK> may have held this view but the 20th century works of <UNK> proving that no <UNK> system can be complete <UNK> works on the limits of <UNK> not to mention chaos theory and quantum <UNK> have all completely <UNK> these ideas which seem central to how the modern day <UNK> <UNK> is supposed to work br br finally the <UNK> of the mouse in the air to mean programming is also just plain wrong as previously mentioned br br this film maybe could have been ok but at least some technical and scientific <UNK> would have given the film some much needed credit in the believability stakes br br i won't forget the film though as like <UNK> it is clearly a unique work but with too many fatal mistakes for me to truly enjoy it 3 10 from me
<START> this was the worst movie i have ever seen molly molly hall could not act at all she had no emotion it was all blah blah blah like she was reading out of a boring text book the smart kid and the kid who loves food there names weren't worth remembering were so annoying it drove me crazy when ever the talked it was about some scientific thing or food <UNK> dad didn't show enough emotion about his daughter missing the police officer and <UNK> dad said the same thing like four times it was just horrible everything was repeated way to much <UNK> should have had something bad happen to her for being so mean i just wasted a moment in my life by watching this movie
<START> the first <UNK> may not have been a great movie but at least it was original there is no such novelty to this one the acting is worse in my opinion and the story is slower and nothing special i also didn't like the dialogue and the special effects are no better than in the original this is movie is inferior to the first one in all ways the only thing different about it is that it is loud and chaotic at times but that doesn't make a good movie if they had done something better with the story and made it interesting this could have been a decent movie i actually couldn't get through it all without fast <UNK> through it to me this is a forgettable movie and not much more despite all that there are worse movies being in a generous mood i'll give <UNK> 2 a 4 10
<START> this appalling film somehow saw the light of day in 1988 it looks and sounds as if it had been produced 20 or 30 years earlier and features some of the worst songs ever included in a major motion picture i <UNK> for the parents and children who paid top dollar to see this
<START> whenever a columbo story <UNK> from the familiar plot colorful killer commits crime columbo <UNK> out killer columbo becomes a <UNK> in the process the writers somehow are never able to match the quality and interest of most traditional episodes this episode <UNK> in the extreme and the result is a major flop br br would you believe columbo never faces the villain till the very end br br frankly i was tempted to turn it off about two thirds through br br oh the sacrifices we self <UNK> reviewers make
<START> christopher <UNK> must have been taught by a <UNK> awful nun because he just can't let go of the concept the play sister mary <UNK> explains it all for you was presented at least in hollywood in precisely the same tone as diane keaton's lecture scenes here sister mary was an exaggeration a lampoon a bitter satire of a <UNK> confident <UNK> and highly <UNK> nun and as played by <UNK> redgrave she was hilarious but the movie insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously while as mentioned maintaining the same tone in the explains it all scenes the two approaches clash <UNK> and in the last twenty minutes the movie goes off the track <UNK> into the <UNK> and explodes there are no survivors it could have worked if the tone of the scenes with the four former students and their encounter with sister mary been pitched the same as the sister mary scenes or if the sister mary scenes been presented more realistically this way simply doesn't work at all
<START> 1st watched 8 26 2001 3 out of 10 <UNK> tobe hooper scary yet sadistic which makes sense portrayal of a relative of the marquis de <UNK> carrying out the same sadistic acts and enjoying it that supposedly his predecessor did this tobe hooper film really doesn't do a whole lot different than his similar in style freddy krueger movies with the same star freddy himself robert englund playing a <UNK> role the marquis de <UNK> and his relative it is also seems like it wants to really poke at christianity but then loses that in the end much to my <UNK> but leaving an inconsistent feel to the movie could have been much worse if <UNK> were taken in sex and violence but they try to keep this at a minimal despite some disgusting scenes my final thought is why would hooper want to make this movie it obviously took awhile to actually get distributed then it has to be advertised <UNK> and with <UNK> name in the title to hopefully make some money on his name and his gore it's obvious this didn't work
<START> being a fan of the manga and anime of go <UNK> devil man devil lady violence jack etc i was looking forward to this one i'd seen neither the manga nor the anime so i had no <UNK> notions going in good thing too what we have here is a series of silly <UNK> movies of the type that used to turn up with <UNK> <UNK> on cable channels late at night while it's tame compared to what gets <UNK> down the throats of regular cable viewers our hero's naughty bits are either <UNK> <UNK> away behind a <UNK> glued on <UNK> or <UNK> with a ridiculous <UNK> effect there are prolonged scenes of bondage and torture that lend the proceedings just enough <UNK> to make it <UNK> for the <UNK> while i have nothing whatsoever against nude female heroes i do dislike <UNK> made movies there are at least four in this series on the plus side there's at least one stunningly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes i saw it's no wonder <UNK> <UNK> boy never made it
<START> this a rip roaring western and i have watched it many times and it entertains on every level however if your after the true facts about such legends as <UNK> cody and <UNK> jane then look elsewhere as john ford suggested this is the west when the truth becomes legend print the legend the story moves with a cracking pace and there is some great dialogue between gary cooper and jean arthur two very watchable stars who help to make this movie the sharp eyed amongst you might just spot <UNK> hayes as an indian <UNK> also there is a very young anthony quinn making his debut as <UNK> warrior he actually married one of <UNK> daughters in real life indeed its <UNK> character who informs cooper of the massacre of <UNK> told in flash back the finale is well done and when the credits roll it <UNK> the american west with american history so please take time out to watch this classic western
<START> this is a wonderful movie with a fun clever story and the dynamics of culture differences and the running theme of what's important in life make this a very under appreciated movie don't let the <UNK> of the world <UNK> you from seeing this keaton has wonderful moments and i wonder at the fact that comedy is never appreciated because actors like keaton make going from humor to serious bits look tremendously easy great movie all around
<START> the only thing that an <UNK> truth proves is that al gore is still an idiot these <UNK> experts are <UNK> because a response to their inane <UNK> is generally beneath real science this is mostly false science folks the greatest source of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is people we <UNK> it and unless you're willing to start <UNK> your <UNK> to save the world there's not a darn thing to be done we've heard how the world was going to end as the result of man for more than 50 years fools <UNK> a time line for their <UNK> and when the time passes nothing has happened an <UNK> truth is just another vehicle with which a <UNK> <UNK> of american society can <UNK> their <UNK> br br and as to al leaving the <UNK> business because of his sister's death from cancer that is a load too al couldn't run his farm any better than he could run the country he was losing money on the operation because he didn't care to farm when he could make more on speaking <UNK> the only global warming that is <UNK> is the hot air produced by this <UNK>
<START> while i would say i enjoy the show i expected something completely different from when i first saw <UNK> i like about <UNK> i expected to find something along the lines of <UNK> <UNK> i am not sure if it is going on anymore but i have to say i do like the show and while i don't <UNK> it as a breakthrough show it is very charming and i do like the chemistry between the characters as well including the supporting cast br br i would definitely say that it is great to see wesley jonathan back on the screen because i really loved him in city guy i had also seen the woman who plays <UNK> friend in popular and while i think that was an okay show i do not really like her character in this show because she's just not my cup of tea but she rounds it out pretty well
<START> i myself am a kid at heart meaning i love watching cartoons still do i remember watching bugs bunny when i was a kid he was my favourite still is i thought man this was a great new show on tv and than my dad said bugs bunny i remember watching him when i was younger and i'm like dad bugs didn't exist when you were younger so i guess he's definitely pleased more than one generation possibly 3 i love the show it's great for kids and adults ok everybody it's very funny me and my husband both in our <UNK> love watching the shows and we don't mind the re runs either this show brings back a lot of memories happy ones i love the christmas special too with <UNK> as tiny tim it's cute i can't pick my favourite looney <UNK> character because they've changed over the years when i was little it was bugs of course and <UNK> pig <UNK> is cool i always loved him actually i have to say there all my favourite i'm giving this show a 10 out of 10 because it's a great show for all ages very funny voice acting is incredible the only flaw is that unfortunately it came to an end 2 decades ago but the re runs are great
<START> writer director co star adam jones is headed for great things that is the thought i had after seeing his feature film cross eyed rarely does an independent film leave me feeling as good as his did cleverly written and masterfully directed cross eyed keeps you involved from beginning to end adam jones may not be a well known name yet but he will be if this movie had one or two named actors it would be a box office sensation i think it still has a chance to get seen by a main stream audience if just one film <UNK> takes the time to work this movie regardless of where it ends up if you get a chance to see it you won't be disappointed
<START> this movie is simply wonderful it's got it all laughter sorrow beauty poetry truth all in a simple yet intense story like life you won't get distracted for a second br br 10 10 br br p s somebody tell hollywood you need a good story to make a good movie and there are so many good stories out there
<START> when i heard that the dukes of hazzard was going to be remade with current actors and a solid script i was like alright i'll give it a chance it's not going to be better than the first but we'll see what happens well i saw what happened i saw a great late 70's 80's show that was a classic basically <UNK> by hollywood it's so sad to see that hollywood <UNK> cannot come up with something original these days they are seeming to take a great show that had a great target audience and try to remake the classic show heads up hollywood it ain't <UNK> anyway more about the show i think they could have casted a better actor than sean william scott <UNK> from american pie to play bo i'm sure that john schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and taken advantage of also get for real johnny <UNK> as luke duke how low can you go a crappy jackass actor to play lovable luke this <UNK> me also i'll give jessica simpson is a beautiful woman but her acting sucks catherine bach who played the original daisy was smart sexy strong <UNK> and a good <UNK> southern girl she was every little girls role model growing up i owned the doll and the <UNK> thank you very much anyway jessica simpson played a smart ass 2 bit slut as daisy duke daisy never was blonde why did they have to cast her jessica alba would have played a great daisy duke she can speak with a great southern accent and she is gorgeous and would have done a wonderful job anyway i'd like to say that this movie blew something fierce i feel like i got ripped off by paying 8 50 for tickets and they should <UNK> my money if you like the dukes of hazzard the original series don't see this movie it'll just upset you <UNK> country music television plays the reruns of the dukes all the time later at night so set your <UNK> and go with the real thing not the imitation on the big screen in hollywood
<START> apart from the usual stereotypes of the thirties eugene <UNK> as the gruff police detective jack la <UNK> as the <UNK> italian and of course james lee as the chinese cook this film is the great mystery of a murder in a locked room for an early 1930's film this step by step <UNK> of the <UNK> of the mystery is similar to the columbo series except in this film you don't have the advantage of knowing who the killer was in advance
<START> the film gets my <UNK> of <UNK> the scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue this is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of film <UNK> character kate is very well developed and her performance is felt throughout the entire film the best work angie dickinson did since point blank
<START> contrary to most reviews i've read i didn't feel this followed any of the other rock movies spinal tap etc the story was more unique although i feel most people wanted to see the sex drugs rock and roll <UNK> that the band kept <UNK> to br br as an american i knew a few of the actors <UNK> <UNK> rea surprised to find out brian bruce robinson was in <UNK> <UNK> classic romeo juliet guess i'll have to rent that next br br the flame still burns my wife who <UNK> from mexico didn't follow the english british language too well missed some of the jokes which i <UNK> explained but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene she loves the song so much now br br funny that amazon com has the soundtrack for 30 <UNK> when i bought the dvd in the bargain bin at wal mart for 5 <UNK> price non <UNK> i first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since
<START> and this is a very disturbing film i may be wrong but this is the last film where i considered burt reynolds an actual actor who transformed the role and delivered a message br br jon voight and ned beatty are also excellent they are <UNK> and unaware <UNK> wanting to enjoy the country little did they know what would happen next br br the photography and sets are realistic and natural this was before the days of wes craven br br what is most disturbing about this film is the fact that places like this still exist in america country folk still <UNK> city people it is almost a century and a half since the civil war br br you will enjoy this film it was filmed in the rural sections of south georgia which still exist just don't drive past that to mobile <UNK> that area still has not been <UNK> since <UNK> <UNK> 10 10
<START> its not braveheart thankfully but it is fine entertainment with engaging characters and good acting all around i enjoyed this film when it was released and upon viewing it again last week find it has held up well over time not a classic film but a very fine and watchable movie to enjoy as great entertainment
<START> watching it now it's still as <UNK> and sexist as i remember comes from a time when girls were <UNK> birds and basically men's <UNK> it's hard to take in that it is from the hammer studios and the fact it's available on dvd when good films are not our nations shame where the working class are portrayed as work shy <UNK> or worse trouble is you can't help feeling nostalgic for a <UNK> on a bus try to hold your stomach <UNK> when you see <UNK> in a <UNK> blue <UNK> <UNK> or something similar like shirley <UNK> used to wear for a concert in 1972 warning this film shows the illegal practice of <UNK> a motorcycle <UNK> by a red double <UNK> bus which i've been informed is not a <UNK> but a <UNK> br br look just don't bother watch something decent instead like <UNK> or <UNK> army or a fly <UNK> up a wall
<START> i really looked forward to this program for two reasons i really liked jan michael vincent and i am an <UNK> nut and have a serious love affair with <UNK> i don't like this program because it takes fantasy to an unbelievable level the world speed record for <UNK> was set at <UNK> <UNK> by a <UNK> <UNK> several years ago the only <UNK> that was ever faster was the experimental <UNK> <UNK> in the 1960's it hit over 300 and was a compound helicopter which means it had a <UNK> <UNK> at the end of its <UNK> providing thrust br br in short no helicopter can fly much over <UNK> because of the principle of <UNK> wing flight and the bell <UNK> the actor that portrayed <UNK> wasn't very fast even by helicopter standards and it didn't stay in production very long br br there was a movie that came out during this time period called blue thunder that was much more realistic
<START> in order to stop her homosexual friend albert perry king from being <UNK> back to <UNK> stella meg foster decides to marry him the only other problem with that is that stella herself is a lesbian the two have their separate lives when one night after <UNK> birthday party they fall into bed and then into love later in the film after falling in love stella suspects albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing what she finds will leave the viewer stunned this is a great film very original perry king and meg foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here very controversial upon its release in 1978 the r rated film is now pg in this much more liberal time br br recently released on dvd the disc contains a making of segment on the special features and in it it's stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not real are mistaken everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved
<START> this is real character and story driven drama at a level that <UNK> most of what we see on tv at the mo br br i was impressed right from the start don't be put off if your not a sci fi nut like me this could be happening on earth the fact that its in another galaxy just makes the show more interesting there are no space ships or laser guns none yet anyway so far i've seen up to <UNK> <UNK> and i'm <UNK> and wondering whats going to happen next as there are so many possibilities br br the cast play there roles with <UNK> eric <UNK> is especially strong br br this show really stands alone well it doesn't matter if you watched bsg or not in fact they are quite different i've read some negative reviews from sci fi <UNK> who expected less drama and more aliens and ray guns etc but i would say ignore them br br this is a really positive start to a show lets hope they don't <UNK> it after 1 or 2 seasons like they normally do with good shows these days
<START> what i hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written these women have no self respect or dignity the entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys amanda <UNK> talent is completely wasted she was brilliant on all that and her own show why they would write her and jenny <UNK> as vapid <UNK> desperate men chasing old maid <UNK> is beyond me br br their plots and dialog remind me of the <UNK> homer says whenever his cartoon character <UNK> is not on screen everyone should ask where's <UNK> all the talk centers on whining about some guy and then whining to some guy sometimes they change it up and the guy <UNK> instead then they get back together or break up at the end the 2 women are either shallow stupid or sex <UNK> the only word i can think of is sucks
<START> watching this was like getting a large <UNK> slapped in your face over and over again even when you thought that <UNK> surely can't be coming around again slap there it was i'm not sure what they were thinking this is the sort of pilot i watched and wondered did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series not only black stereotypes but swedish and indian ones as well and while blazing <UNK> made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and <UNK> these stereotypes were just downright offensive there was no plot line the ending was slapped on and the jokes aren't still if you are a student of comedy watch this pilot to see what you shouldn't do
<START> as gently as i can i sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time i did not find it the <UNK> emotionally <UNK> film others did i found it boring with music that distracted from the film the story was thin the characters <UNK> and the direction pedestrian br br <UNK> br br now i'm going to write some more about this movie so i make the 10 line minimum there really isn't more to be said and <UNK> is important but imdb has its <UNK> so here goes br br young eager kid finds <UNK> talent seeks time with aging <UNK> mentor in spite of father's cartoonish <UNK> aging <UNK> mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little conflict <UNK> while i don't think this is a spoiler i've added the warning in case someone feels this much information is too much br br mostly i just found the film boring and pretentious a waste of my time i honestly don't understand what little fuss there seems to be mostly on this web site about the <UNK> quality of this movie i think it's really worth avoiding but as dennis miller used to say maybe i'm wrong
<START> a rating of 1 does not begin to express how dull depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is
<START> pathetic worse than a bad made for tv movie i can't believe that spacey and freeman were in this flick for some reason morgan <UNK> character is constantly talking about and saying <UNK> when referring to <UNK> boy's girlfriend morgan freeman calling women <UNK> is just awkward what the hell were the people behind this film thinking too many plot holes to imagine combined with the horrid acting confusing camera angles a lame script and cheap background music made this movie absolutely unbearable br br i rented this flop with low expectations but well it really sucked
<START> aaron spelling produced this made for television western that gets awfully <UNK> for a <UNK> three minute film it plays like a <UNK> failed series pilot br br handsome clint walker is u s <UNK> dave <UNK> who wanders into <UNK> arizona territory in time to kill one of the brothers of the local <UNK> <UNK> who is out on a trail drive br br walker takes the other brother to jail walker also meets a cute homeless mexican kid who sleeps at the <UNK> one night <UNK> is <UNK> when a villain and another man dressed in army blue take the remaining brother into the street and kill him <UNK> the murder on walker not good for your first twenty four hours on the job walker visits the local army <UNK> and <UNK> the chains of the commander the <UNK> hears of his <UNK> deaths and rides back to town in time to get his chains <UNK> as well the local native population who get short changed by the army on their <UNK> also get <UNK> in the chains area with all these chains getting <UNK> walker still has time to woo the local hotel owner the army guy involved in the murder ends up dead the local cattle <UNK> is <UNK> the indians do a lot of <UNK> <UNK> and the climax brings about an unlikely showdown as walker must prove to the town that the villainous cattle <UNK> had a boss someone we have suspected as being too helpful all along br br there is a semi subplot involving the death of <UNK> family at the hands of army <UNK> and i think this would have been the force behind the series had it been picked up instead the film ends abruptly and i kept waiting for scenes from next <UNK> exciting episode because of the fade outs for nonexistent commercial breaks the pacing is all off on this and its story jumps in fits br br walker is handsome rugged and has a voice deeper than a well the rest of the cast is full of television actors you have probably seen in other television movies much of the action is pretty lame and the violence is tepid the first brother killed gets a shotgun blast <UNK> and falls without a scratch on him i did not expect <UNK> dogs but this is the wrong film to use to teach children about the evil of guns speaking of children the mexican kid here goes from cute to <UNK> inducing annoyance very quickly br br if you dislike westerns then you will dislike <UNK> if you like westerns then you will still dislike <UNK> i cannot recommend it br br this is <UNK> but contains physical violence and gun violence br br
<START> i pulled down a vhs box from my vast collection many unseen and picked out a movie based on the box art i thought would be fun and yes bad prison had that 80s cheesy look all over that box i sat down and watched and lo and behold found that sometimes we do indeed sit down to a movie with <UNK> expectations in mind fortunately i <UNK> mine quickly and soon realized i was sitting down not just to an okay film but a rather good movie in total prison tells the story of an old <UNK> prison being <UNK> to save on <UNK> concerns it looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners the prison used as a set is incredibly atmospheric and easily the most important character in the film the story using the prison as its central setting tells in a prologue of a man being killed via the electric chair we see lane smith as a guard <UNK> away a <UNK> before sending the man to his maker we then go to present day first with a government board at a meeting deciding to open the prison and send a beautiful doctor in to make sure that conditions are acceptable as she <UNK> <UNK> against re opening the old prison then we see the new warden lane smith haunted by a nightmare in bed and given the new job of opening a prison he has not been to in years well the rest follows suit prisoners and guards arrive with plenty of stereotypes <UNK> we are given some character depth and several of the prisoners are interesting characters the acting is better than one might expect with lane smith doing as always a <UNK> job viggo <UNK> as a very different prisoner being solid tom everett tiny <UNK> and <UNK> kane really exploring the boundaries of their stereotypical characters <UNK> field is okay as the female lead the best performance is by lincoln <UNK> an underrated character actor as <UNK> a prisoner who had been in that very same prison years ago when the man had been executed with some kind of terrible secret prison is not the next best thing to <UNK> bread or anything like that but it is definitely worth a look and definitely better than most would expect from it i was pleasantly surprised at the way director <UNK> <UNK> created a story so visually atmospheric the film has a tense taut pace and <UNK> knows how to build his scenes there are a few <UNK> shot gore scenes the one with the <UNK> wire was a bit much as was the one with all the <UNK> but these scenes are visually creative and interesting the acting is uniformly decent the script actually much more cohesive than one usually gets from films like these that may in part be credited to irwin <UNK> who wrote the story you may remember he came up with the idea of making halloween scary as a holiday here he makes <UNK> a hell of a lot more scarier than it already is give prison a break get it
<START> i thought it was pretty interesting my social studies language arts teacher was the police chief guy that was holding the <UNK> on the water barrel part d i was excited my teacher is in some commercials he was in a gas coffee phone play station commercial its nice seeing him on tv he was also on everybody hates chris except he always get the small part la la why do we have to right 10 lines thats so stupid i think i'm done never mind i'm still not done what is this a joke why do we have to go all the way to line ten really what's the point of it i will just right random words for now <UNK> story is fun i love my friends
<START> this film was so disappointing from the <UNK> that made me decide to see phantom love why is it called this i had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery it did have some interesting images but these often seemed random and made no sense in fact they seemed like they were inserted to fill in time in the end the effect was <UNK> br br i believe the film was meant to be atmospheric but it just wasn't the lack of a coherent plot did not help matters you might say it was mysterious but i think it was just incoherent with no atmosphere br br the main character seemed to be disturbed but the plot did not draw me in enough to care about her situation without looking at the cast list i would not have known that you see the main character as a child the film has very little context for the time place or character i am not a <UNK> but the sex scenes there were several seemed pointless and confused me further i <UNK> <UNK> but i was not sure if it was the same man different men a lover her husband or was she a prostitute it was only when i saw the credits that i discovered the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover this film did manage to make what should have been shocking dream sequences involving <UNK> mother seem a bit boring br br the nail <UNK> actually made more sense as it did give some indication of <UNK> emotional state i will not fault the actors as i don't they had a lot to work on br br i do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of <UNK> or because it was pretentious but the end result was dull br br i can't be bothered talking about it anymore
<START> return to the lost world was filmed back to back with the 1992 version of the lost world br br in this sequel the same five people lead by <UNK> return to the <UNK> where a group has started <UNK> for oil which is threatening to destroy the land <UNK> has something to do with this they manage to defeat the <UNK> and the <UNK> is saved much to the delight of the natives br br like in the lost world what few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a t rex and <UNK> br br john <UNK> davies and david warner <UNK> their roles as <UNK> and <UNK> and three of the other actors are also back br br despite reading several bad reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs i enjoyed return to the lost world br br rating 3 stars out of 5
<START> it's a bad season for bollywood with all the big releases with a massive hype surrounding proving to be <UNK> at the box office london dreams is no exception to that let's <UNK> it it's all about chasing your dreams and how far will you go to achieve it sounds impressive right but unfortunately the film is not br br <UNK> ajay <UNK> is an aspiring musician who wants to make it big someday his dream is to perform in <UNK> stadium in front of a cheering 90 000 audience calling out his name he is joined by two brothers <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> roy <UNK> and a ravishing <UNK> <UNK> together they form london dreams their dream band after <UNK> the chief of a record company they become overnight <UNK> <UNK> is secretly in love with <UNK> which he doesn't want to reveal till he achieves his goal <UNK> then brings his childhood friend <UNK> <UNK> aka <UNK> salman khan a <UNK> <UNK> guy who has got no ambitions in life to join their band <UNK> is a trained musician and a real talent for whom later <UNK> become <UNK> for <UNK> superior skills and his affair with <UNK> <UNK> with the help of <UNK> plans to <UNK> <UNK> what happens next forms the rest of the movies br br coming to the technical aspects we feel only the shadow of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whom we have admired in <UNK> london felt like he simply <UNK> the screenplay to cut it short a <UNK> cameraman screenplay by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even though it has its moments defined in a predictable fashion the screenplay bore you to stiff camera work was awesome in capturing the beauty of london it's the only entertaining part while watching songs br br few songs are <UNK> while others are passable <UNK> fare ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character salman is monotonous and he <UNK> you <UNK> is forgettable and i don't that she will make it big in bollywood <UNK> roy is impressive while <UNK> is strictly ok <UNK> as the bitch is what we have seen in <UNK> movies <UNK> is ongoing with the proceedings i don't want to pen down about the flaws as it will be a <UNK> task br br finally let me put it simple and straight london dreams is a soulless movie which you may better enjoy on dvd
<START> people forget that there have been several king kong <UNK> <UNK> king kong vs godzilla king kong 1976 they all ripoff one another but yeti stands on its own it only borrows one element from king kong and that is the <UNK> attraction with one female br br the yeti myth is based on bigfoot not like king kong and <UNK> have been fascinated it at one time they did exist but there is no scientific data to prove it br br this movie is hard to find but its worth watching it the first time i watched it was on <UNK> mistress of the dark shows in the early 1980's it sent chills down my spine as a kid especially when the yeti got mad i saw it again around 1 <UNK> on abc about 2 to <UNK> ago seeing it again made me appreciate it more it has some overall good effects for its time and the story involves a mute boy and his dog and an evil businessman person who wants to kill the yeti for his own purposes also the music is pretty cool its very yeti like br br <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> creates a great monster like atmosphere br br vote 7 and half out of 10
<START> alright normally i am not as harsh on sequels especially if the first film is done well and was ultimately a good movie as for 1999 i feel that one of the top five films was cruel intentions it had everything a great movie should have except for an original story being adapted from a novel it was still damn good on to cruel intentions 2 which was supposed to actually just be the opener for a series based on the film called <UNK> <UNK> which must not have happened actually after seeing this <UNK> of a film i can understand before the thing started i was like at least the writer and director roger <UNK> did this one also well 1 minute into this movie i was disappointed it starts off with a rehash of the opening of the original with a different twist sebastian instead of putting the <UNK> daughter's naked picture on the net he puts the schools principals wife in the school <UNK> naked this would have been alright if the lady was not like 50 and basically the rest of the movie is a wannabe <UNK> copy of the original which i understand the if there is nothing wrong with it leave it the way it was but you can not do that with a movie this actually being a prequel i gave it a chance just to see how they turned out like they did in part 1 but with sebastian being more or less just a <UNK> and kathryn being a herself and turning sebastian into the sexual predator he was in the real story this movie had no foundation to it whoever did the casting on this thing was way off they could have at least tried to get people who looked like the original cast but no they just hired a bunch of not even really good looking actors i am using this term although i dont know why they for sure didnt do any in this movie br br all this movie is a bunch of one liners that dont even match the wit that the original had well some of them did but that was just because they were from part 1 another bad point was in part one you could understand the need for them to act out for attention because there was no involvement from <UNK> parents this one had them in it and they were poorly used as if to show why the kids are like this it didnt work though the best thing though about the original was that the cast had chemistry they took you into this world the on screen tension that was there made the film what it was this thing really ruins the experience of the first one stay way from this
<START> going into this i was expecting anything really good but after the damage this <UNK> on me i'm just happy to think <UNK> it's hard to think what the film makers ha this was a good movie the stories and i use the world loosely are incoherent and do make any sense at all there just stupid things that happen at random the acting if can be called acting is horrible i've seen <UNK> acting in toy ads i know it's a low budget video bin <UNK> but still even it's not like they tried will after <UNK> thought it i feel very sleepy and still <UNK> do i'm going to go lie down br br <UNK> do not <UNK> to drive walk read or do any after watching <UNK> other side <UNK> may <UNK> lose of any or all metal <UNK>
<START> kurt russell whose career started when he kicked the real elvis in it happened at the world's fair will probably never top his performance as the king in this biopic <UNK> by slash and shock <UNK> carpenter there are times you feel that you're watching elvis until something <UNK> you back to reality perhaps memories of a hapless don johnson in elvis and the beauty queen all the performances here are excellent season <UNK> as <UNK> pat <UNK> as the colonel even shelley winters brings the right level of nerves and <UNK> to her rendering of <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> dad bing is here playing <UNK> father <UNK> and there's a fine understated performance from robert gray as <UNK> buddy and bodyguard red west br br a must see for rock n roll fans
<START> i get tired of my 4 and 5 year old daughters constantly being subjected to watch <UNK> disney and the like it all seems to be the same old tired cartoons <UNK> over and over again when my daughters couldn't go to the fair this afternoon because one of them was sick i wanted them to just relax and rest for a while i <UNK> the tv on and in searching for something different i <UNK> the channels my finger stopped channel surfing the moment i heard <UNK> voice i adore every single <UNK> thing this man has done and when i saw that he was doing voice over work for a little duck well i couldn't change the channel my daughters were instantly <UNK> by the cartoon and the more we watched the show together the more i grew to love it along with the message that was being portrayed it's not necessarily a <UNK> for gay rights but rather for anyone who has ever been <UNK> as a child for anything i had friends who were picked on for one thing or another too fat too skinny too feminine being a bully not being smart enough only having one parent you name it kids as a rule can be very very cruel to one another so i was happy to see an entertaining cartoon that actually conveyed a life message to its audience my girls already accept others as they are and don't pick on others for being different my older daughter actually stands up for her friends if they're picked on one happens to have a single mom and that little girl is picked on quite often it <UNK> my heart when <UNK> stands up for her br br so those of you who are <UNK> this show because you feel that it's an <UNK> for gay rights or are being forced to accept certain views you clearly and completely missed the point of this poignant little cartoon br br and if you need it explained to you well you need more help than any television show could ever offer
<START> a beautiful piece of children's cinema buried in a world of <UNK> <UNK> setting the story around the famous book of <UNK> believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of <UNK> off the western coast of scotland br br telling the tale of a young <UNK> apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of <UNK> <UNK> the fierce <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> mythology in hopes of recovering a lost <UNK> br br the films true beauty lies in its' animation cell <UNK> in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity <UNK> much from the artistic style of the brilliant cartoon network series <UNK> <UNK> for its genius use of mark making and background depth the secret of <UNK> creates a consistently <UNK> <UNK> world living under the shadow of <UNK> invasion br br the history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is as she <UNK> from branch to branch appearing and disappearing like a mysterious <UNK> with qualities resembling the legendary <UNK> cat from alice and wonderland br br the secret of <UNK> is an absolute treat for all <UNK> all ages it's a lovely piece of family cinema br br don't expect to be <UNK> but instead pleasantly impressed
<START> i never wanted to see this film then one day for a joke i watched it to see how bad it was my <UNK> were confirmed br br for starters i'd like to question the politics of the film it hides behind of mask of women <UNK> it big in the <UNK> but the only way that women can make it big is through using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills these women are nothing more the <UNK> are slightly less attractive girls not allowed to be successful this is not the only right wing message of the film there are hundreds of shots of american <UNK> and huge <UNK> of cash a fine example of how the only powerful thing in america is capitalism and anything of spiritual moral or artistic value is not even given a look in of this film money is depicted as the only important thing to young people br br the <UNK> of the bar states that she does not allow drug users in her bar and then she goes on to poor <UNK> of hard <UNK> down her own neck and then the <UNK> of her staff and customers any one who knows anything about <UNK> will know that <UNK> can be just as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs br br and finally why are scenes in which the lead character is a point of sexual interest to the audience when she is getting <UNK> or with her boyfriend is her father always involved we watch get her <UNK> with the camera virtually <UNK> her legs while she is one the phone to her father she <UNK> her father just as she <UNK> her boyfriend i find this most strange br br in conclusion this film is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to women and frankly disturbing but what else do you expect from jerry <UNK>
<START> i loved watching <UNK> hunt <UNK> back in the day i was in <UNK> school and would get home do my <UNK> and by 4 30 would be ready to watch <UNK> hunt <UNK> and mike nelson in his underwater adventures i loved it he took to you a place not very accessible at that time under the great blue sea pre <UNK> <UNK> or even before <UNK> became common there was mike nelson <UNK> the imagination of kids i'd be willing to <UNK> that more than a few kids developed their passion for <UNK> or <UNK> or one of the <UNK> from watching this show underwater photography also progressed the fascination for exploration is easily <UNK> thru watching this show watch and enjoy
<START> first things first the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed now actress wang zu <UNK> the one who played <UNK> <UNK> in the movie is <UNK> years old and well aged it's always good to review these glorious times when seeing old school <UNK> productions like this br br the movie is one of the most influential titles made in 1980s the art set decoration and other aesthetic <UNK> are all mesmerizing more fantastically the movie had a total black humorous <UNK> in it it feels like a horror movie but ultimately it's not <UNK> but only fun br br i had the experience of <UNK> the second script of a chinese <UNK> story and i thought that script was a decent write however when i saw the movie i firstly was disappointed in seeing the movie different from the script like in a smaller scale and involving more comic roles however it turned out to be better executed in terms of being entertaining br br if you have seen the lord of the rings you will notice the similarities in this movie to lotr the climax is like a mirror of miranda otto fighting with the ring witch it's definitely a laugh out loud bravo
<START> an actress making a movie in africa is kidnapped and taken into the jungle where she is held for <UNK> the producer hires some one to go and bring her back <UNK> everything are the cannibals in the jungle who worship a really ugly looking god who likes to eat naked women br br this is a gory sleazy movie there is <UNK> amounts of nudity and violence not to mention violence against nude people its an exploitation film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being and if the movie wasn't so boring this film would be a classic lets face it despite the gore the nasty sex and abuse and the ugly monster this movie is a <UNK> the pacing is all off <UNK> and it puts you out there are multiple plot lines that all seem to be happening <UNK> from each other even though its ultimately all one story worst of all almost no one says anything most of the minimal dialog concerns the cruelty or one characters <UNK> that i'll do what i want its such a quiet and dull movie that if it weren't for the frequent screams of the victims i'd recommend this as a sleep <UNK> br br this is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep or unless you need to see every euro cannibal movie br br an aside <UNK> just released this as part of their terror tales series their print is oddly letter <UNK> which looks to be the result of taking their print from a japanese source there is <UNK> that was <UNK> to remove the subtitles their print also has no opening titles
<START> set in japan <UNK> is the story of demons taking over the earth the premise is far more complicated but the <UNK> storyline should not be forgotten japan is in turmoil with demons <UNK> human form <UNK> the lands generally speaking demons look and act like humans but are evil the japanese word they use is not just demons but rather the classical form of <UNK> which is a <UNK> creature of some historic stature we're talking about creatures that would appear more like gods than simple ugly child eating monsters br br however in human form all that remains is the green eyes and green teeth which appear when put under any sort of stress in order to save the world from demons there are demon <UNK> trained and skilled warriors who can spot and defeat most every kind of demon and who guard the passage way between the realm of hell and that of the real world these are the basic premises br br the story begins with a festival in a local town amid these <UNK> 3 men ride in dressed in all black seemingly intent on doing harm the villagers run <UNK> those which are demonic in nature who turn green eyed and try to kill them the demon <UNK> end up killing off the majority of the demons from here the story gets interesting the whole essence of the story begins when at the gate to hell a fortune telling demon appears before the 3 gate <UNK> revealing the arrival of <UNK> with it comes the end of the reign of man and begins the reign of demons <UNK> however requires some form of <UNK> process the first step of which occurred during the opening battle but which won't be revealed to you until you see the film the 3 demon <UNK> are a wise old man a powerful yet <UNK> man and a skilled and compassionate warrior immediately you can see the split between them the old man wanting to stop the demons the powerful one wanting to bend them to his increasing ego <UNK> wishes and the third looking to stop the second along the way he meets a woman who he begins to take fancy to and believes himself to have a special relationship with she in turn is a <UNK> who is good natured sought after by authorities when the two finally meet face to face he places his hand on her shoulder and suddenly she is <UNK> by a mark on her shoulder needless to say the mark is not a good sign what ensues is a battle for earth a battle between both good and evil as it should be but also between good and good itself br br the point for me of this film became something other than what i thought it would i came in thinking it would either be a fast paced action style film with demons or a horror film with macabre evil and foul creatures the likes of which would be seen in <UNK> and <UNK> on i was however mistaken in the best possible way the story it seemed to me is an adaptation of a very old japanese play and it plays itself out as such combining the essentially action driven <UNK> scenes with a great concept an amazing narrative and a style which makes you compelled to think rather than just sit <UNK> in gore many scenes are painted with <UNK> dialogue between two characters the likes of which will never be seen in a hollywood film it becomes a practically theatrical experience which takes your breath away br br the film makes use of some <UNK> scenery and camera work comparable to many great samurai films of our days but adding to it a well thought and classical plot with great acting great music and thoroughly stunning scenes its a must watch in my book br br that being said it does need the <UNK> that it is not for everyone its not cheap thrills horror its not balls to the wall action its a horror style play thats been filmed it has very much to say and takes the time to do so flying in the face of the conventional one liners like japanese plays the <UNK> between the characters can last for many minutes before they come together for a quick yet marvelous battle scene if you can enjoy such a thing this is a masterpiece if your idea of a good film is slasher flicks with little plot and excessive nudity then you can easily watch something else br br overall this film to me is a unique and amazing one which keeps you <UNK> and amused it has good writing good acting and good direction it is all in all a <UNK> great film
<START> this is a really good film and one that i've enjoyed watching several times michael <UNK> awesome as always michael caine has received kind of a reputation for taking any role in any movie no matter what the quality or lack of same but he does a good turn in playing sidney from the start it's so well written who would have thought that ira <UNK> who wrote such creepy stuff as the boys from brazil and rosemary's baby could write something this witty let's face it michael caine chris reeve <UNK> cannon henry jones how are you going to go wrong with a cast this good directed by sidney lumet br br i'm really <UNK> to go on because if anyone were to give away anything about this film it would be a crime just watch it and adore it
<START> steve carell plays dan burns newspaper agony uncle and dedicated single father to three girls at a large family <UNK> dan meets his perfect woman only to find out that she is in a relationship with his brother br br what's a man to do br br i rather liked dan in real life but i would imagine the success or otherwise of this flick is going to be down to whether you are willing to accept steve carell playing a part relatively straight and restrained rather than going through the broad comedy moves that have made him so successful if you cannot accept it fear not get smart will be along later in the year but for the record i thought he was very good br br dan in real life starts off like your typical incidentally amusing family drama but it gets funnier and funnier as it goes along and <UNK> frustration with his situation grows it's not <UNK> original but if you only saw movies with original ideas cinematic <UNK> would be very <UNK> indeed wouldn't they but dan in real life is entertaining and a good cast who wouldn't fall in love at first sight with the <UNK> juliette <UNK> make the most of an insightful enough script that contains many a <UNK> on the meaning and passion of love br br i hope that steve carell pushes himself and does something as interesting again
<START> this is indeed a funny show done in a creepy sort of way much like a tim burton film it's worth a look as it's far more creative than most of the shows this season best of all it's not a reality show i'm wondering why the viewing public is so ready to accept shows like that which lack creativity and ignore wonderful shows like this that actually have a creative bent br br while some <UNK> the premise i think it's really unusual much more enjoyable than ghost <UNK> and medium i think it's the funniest thing on the tube since my name is earl br br oh and the narration and music are wonderful if you enjoy shows that are a bit off the beaten path i'd recommend it it's not as strange as twin peaks was but it's got a serious <UNK> to it
<START> where's michael caine when you need him i've seen most of the many seasons of mst3k but this rare pre 1st season flick <UNK> k 20 is easily one of the worst movies ever made three stars lee <UNK> chris <UNK> and burgess meredith struggle through the worst <UNK> of cinematography ever delivering lines which must have been written by a secret dick <UNK> style <UNK> composed of <UNK> and <UNK> lawyers trying to cut funding for mass <UNK> and energy <UNK> research looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness possibly on super 8 makes <UNK> run look like the cinematic <UNK> <UNK> crossed with shakespeare i can't imagine watching it without the commentary of crow and <UNK> since it's unwatchable even with it clearly what's needed in hollywood is some sort of <UNK> which <UNK> the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care with its rights to <UNK> and drive theme by the end i'm half expecting to see a charlton heston cameo where he delivers his cold dead hands speech lee i could have forgiven you for this in 1989 but 1981
<START> <UNK> girls <UNK> lawrence and dorothy west receive some terrific news at the local post office unaware they are being stalked by <UNK> charles <UNK> meanwhile father david miles receives a message from young robert harron which <UNK> daddy leaving home so when the young women return they can <UNK> home alone as the vulnerable pair bed down for the evening the local grand ball of the black and <UNK> gets <UNK> and a dark skinned <UNK> <UNK> additional danger for d w <UNK> dynamic <UNK> br br mr <UNK> has one of his better <UNK> roles stealing the film from the girls and daddy ironically director griffith appears as one of the black faced extras at the black and <UNK> ball <UNK> girls lawrence and west are suggestive of later griffith girls <UNK> and dorothy <UNK> especially in <UNK> of the storm <UNK> and they are <UNK> <UNK> in bed the racist tone is unfortunate since the story of a <UNK> redeemed by saving his potential victims from a greater danger is intriguing br br the girls and daddy 2 1 <UNK> d w griffith <UNK> lawrence dorothy west charles <UNK>
<START> unless somebody <UNK> me i really have no idea what this movie is about it looks like a picture with a message but it´s far from it this movie tells pointless story of a new york press agent and about his problems and <UNK> basically all when that agent is played by pacino one must think that it must be something important but it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is to one of the best actors in the world al pacino this is the second movie of the year the other is <UNK> that deserves the title the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year so <UNK> going on al
<START> this film has to be the worst i have ever seen the title of the film <UNK> the audience into thinking there maybe hope the story line of the film is laughable at best with the acting so poor you just have to cringe the title <UNK> <UNK> implies a <UNK> of zombies when in fact there are six in total this cannot be <UNK> as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy 80's music when the zombies <UNK> the zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a la <UNK> video if you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so then burn the copy
<START> anyone who doesn't think bill and ted's bogus journey is one of the greatest movies of all time needs their head checked it somehow manages to be both completely inane and no <UNK> but also terrifying knowing and clever at the same time one of those rare films that actually <UNK> upon it predecessor bogus journey can be enjoyed again and again notable highlights include the duel with death and the ending which is highly emotional keanu wants to forget all that matrix rubbish and get down to doing what he does best ted theodore logan in bill and ted the return
<START> this is an <UNK> and <UNK> piece of garbage that no doubt wants to be a friday the 13th 1980 clone the poster for this movie makes it look like there's going to be some sort of a cross between jason and freddy which is likely to attract movie goers there is nothing good or entertaining about this movie about this movie it just makes me sad just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon <UNK> camp ii unhappy <UNK> 1988 on video or dvd and waste their time with this sad cynical depressing movie br br angela baker pamela <UNK> is a camp <UNK> at camp rolling hills who hopes that the other <UNK> are as nice as she is and that they stay out of trouble meanwhile the other <UNK> are realizing that people are disappearing one by one with angela making up the excuse that she had to send them home could angela be the killer who was once a man who <UNK> a sex change operation years earlier who knows who cares br br the 1980s was home to a lot of movies that made the cross between the mad slasher and dead teenager genres in which a mad killer goes <UNK> some have a plot some don't but they're all about as bad as this one <UNK> camp ii unhappy <UNK> is 80 minutes of teenagers being introduced and then being stabbed <UNK> <UNK> chopped up burned alive and <UNK> that's all this movie is it is just mindless bloody violence br br watching this movie i was reminded of the friday the 13th movies in which the message for its viewers was that the primary function of teenagers is to be <UNK> to death the filmmakers of <UNK> camp ii have every right to be ashamed of themselves imagine the sick message that this movie offers for its teen viewers the world is a totally evil place this movie tells you and it'll kill you it doesn't matter what your dreams or your hopes are it doesn't matter if you have a new boyfriend or a new girlfriend it doesn't matter what you think what you do or what your plans for the future are you can forget those plans because you're just going to wind up dead br br and the <UNK> thing is and by not giving too much away the movie simply sets up room for a sequel well why not they've probably and already taken the bucket to the <UNK> by making three or four of these movies i missed out on the original <UNK> camp 1983 and after watching its first sequel i will hopefully stay away from the other sequels as well as the original and for parents if you know kids who actually like this movie do not let them date your children
<START> the great vincent price has done many fantastic horror films some of which range among the greatest genre gems of all time <UNK> greatest achievements were <UNK> his films in the 60s with films such as roger <UNK> brilliant poe cycle still the greatest horror cycle of all time michael <UNK> <UNK> general 1968 or <UNK> <UNK> the last man on earth 1964 <UNK> the ultimate highlights of this brilliant man's career the films that made the man famous and thereby made him the immortal horror icon he is however date back to the 50s with house of wax 1953 <UNK> his rise to stardom the mad magician of 1954 follows a plot that is very similar to that of its successful predecessor this is not to say however that this film isn't an original delightfully macabre and absolutely wonderful gem itself as the lines above may suggest vincent price is my favorite actor and while i personally would not allow myself to miss anything the man has been in none of my fellow fans of the man may miss this little gem br br price stars as don <UNK> aka <UNK> the great an underrated master magician and <UNK> of magic devices whose boss a sleazy businessman stole his wife eva <UNK> from him when the boss takes away one of <UNK> ingenious <UNK> and gives it to his rival the great <UNK> john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a murderous spree of revenge begins br br don't we love vincent price when he's out for revenge some of his most famous and greatest films such as the <UNK> dr <UNK> 1971 or theater of blood 1973 were about absurd and delightfully macabre revenge murders and this earlier film in his horror career is another proof that no one takes revenge as vincent price does this film provides a wonderfully eccentric leading role for price who as always delivers a brilliant performance and <UNK> 70 minutes of outrageously entertaining and macabre fun for every horror fan another must see for my fellow price fans
<START> the story concerns a <UNK> <UNK> mel harris who is hired by her <UNK> <UNK> like <UNK> queen aunt her aunt by marriage we are left to presume is trying to track down her long lost family in europe all they have to go on is a photo of a young girl standing by an <UNK> music box the <UNK> heads to europe and <UNK> her search in places like <UNK> <UNK> and vienna the scenery is the real thing and is actually shot on location unlike a murder she wrote where jessica is supposed to be visiting a far <UNK> locale and lansbury never left <UNK> anyway she meets a young man who is also searching to solve a family mystery of his own and they team up to track down clues and menace bad guys the dialogue particularly the romantic dialogue is terrible i watched this because of the scenery but the script was so bad that i stayed on just to see if it would get worse it did acting was also off i can see why mel <UNK> career never really took off after <UNK> but she is adequate seems too old for her co star though but the supporting players are straight out of the community <UNK> i also lost count of how many times they say <UNK> to each other yes it is <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> we know okay i realized halfway into the film that this had to be one of those <UNK> movies and sure enough it is guess that says it all
<START> isabelle <UNK> is a wonderful actor the director of la <UNK> understands this providing the viewer with long takes of <UNK> face and these are a pleasure to see <UNK> is not an animated actor she <UNK> emotion with the smallest lift of an <UNK> or <UNK> of a smile br br other than the enjoyment of watching an experienced actor <UNK> in her profession there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it well if you enjoy self <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and bizarre behavior la <UNK> might work for you other than these attributes i could not find any redeeming value in it br br buried in all this strange material there is a <UNK> of truth people who compete at the very highest level <UNK> <UNK> whatever begin as strange people and are shaped into stranger people by the <UNK> environment br br not worth a trip to a movie theater to <UNK> this life lesson br br
<START> the movie starts quite with an intriguing scene three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar all of them are making up a bit outrageous stories as the movie unfolds it turns out that the most outrageous story is true however beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed this revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly not much is left to be seen the rest of the time director is lingering in a god <UNK> russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies sure these are fascinating and a bit shocking images but <UNK> them goes on way too long <UNK> any possible plot or character development i found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy movie making where instead of trying to make an interesting story movie makers concentrate on <UNK> fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories case in point meat <UNK> story to leave the <UNK> to figure out all odds and ends on a surface it has artsy appearance but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent
<START> i read all the reviews here after watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that somebody else didn't think that this <UNK> unfunny montage wasn't the <UNK> of humour in the 70s or indeed in any other era if this isn't the least funny set of sketch comedy i've ever seen it'll do till it comes along half of the skits had already been done and infinitely better by acts such as monty python and woody allen if i was to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film it would still not get close to <UNK> up just how mindless and drivel ridden this waste of 75 minutes is <UNK> comedy only in the world where <UNK> really does mean <UNK> <UNK> humour only in a world where <UNK> is actually <UNK> <UNK> jokes only if by that we mean that this is a <UNK> of how not to do comedy tits and <UNK> and the odd <UNK> nice if you are a <UNK> boy with at least one hand free and haven't found out that playboy exists give it a break because it was the early 70s no way there had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior the only way i could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at <UNK> retro hardly sketches about <UNK> subtly <UNK> children may be cutting edge in some circles and it could actually have been funny but it just comes off as really quite sad what kept me going throughout the entire 75 minutes sheer belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end i gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score and i can only recommend it to <UNK> or coma patients or perhaps people suffering from <UNK> their jaws would finally drop open in disbelief
<START> i can't believe the likes of <UNK> del toro and kim <UNK> got involved ins this piece of garbage the script is so poorly written and the directing so weak both by the same person that its hard to find more one dimension characters in a film the dialogs are so lame that this so called thriller got laughs out of the few fools that got into the theatre the setup it's <UNK> <UNK> you to believe you are going to watch a chilling thriller and suddenly it turns out into the most stupid <UNK> film <UNK> character is so dumb that she actually stops to scream to god where are you so the people after her can follow and then takes a <UNK> and then she apparently got into the smallest wood in the world i mean she runs all over the place and the killers never loose track of her and this happens in the middle of the night it really makes me wonder is that really the best writing people in hollywood can find that they spend millions producing it
<START> yes the southern star features a pretty forgettable title tune sung by that heavy set <UNK> matt <UNK> it pretty much <UNK> the tone for this <UNK> and rather dull feature stunningly miscast with george segal and ursula <UNK> as an adventurous couple in search of a large diamond add in harry andrews with a strange accent no less chasing an <UNK> tons of stock footage of <UNK> and poorly composed and dull photography by <UNK> <UNK> and you end up with a thoroughly <UNK> romp through the <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> yesterday i saw the movie <UNK> and my girlfriend told me it was the worst movie she's ever seen since i thought it was pretty awful as well it got me thinking which film was the worst film i had ever seen and this was the only film that came to mind br br unfortunately it was a couple of years since i've seen it but i remember the horribly miscast dean cain as cocky military man pretty boy cain doesn't do cocky very well the strange deal with the cgi helicopter when it would probably be cheaper to rent a <UNK> than to hire some cgi guys to make it but my guess is that they found the <UNK> as a free <UNK> for some cgi program or the <UNK> son liked to play with his new computer and how did it look awful and when the dragon charges through the corridors of the complex then <UNK> the same shots over and over looks very cheap br br avoid this movie it is truly awful
<START> i watched this series when it first came out in the 70s i was 14 years old and i watched it at my best friends house as my dad didn't want to watch it it became a weekly ritual every sunday and as anyone will tell you for two <UNK> year olds to watch a documentary in almost <UNK> silence must mean that this was something special br br the broad <UNK> of the events of world war 2 makes for a difficult subject to document so the makers broke it down into what they considered to be the most significant key happenings and devoted one episode to each some episodes covered long periods such as <UNK> <UNK> which covered nearly all six years of the battle of the atlantic while the battle of <UNK> had one episode to itself br br this documentary could not be made today quite simply because most of those interviewed are dead the list of significant players appearing gives an amazing insight into the thinking at the time anthony <UNK> the foreign secretary carl <UNK> head of the u <UNK> albert <UNK> pet architect confident and later <UNK> minister for hitler in one of the later episodes we see <UNK> <UNK> hitler's secretary who was with him in the <UNK> and it was to her that he <UNK> his last will and testament she left the <UNK> after hitler's suicide and escaped through the russian lines these and many others play a major role in the realism of the events portrayed br br if i have any criticism of the series it is that the code <UNK> of <UNK> park are not included but the revelations of their part in the war only emerged after the series had been made so i cannot blame the programme makers br br the opening titles and music are magnificent and lawrence <UNK> narration lends a natural gravity to the script br br the best documentary series ever made without doubt <UNK>
<START> it is a superb swedish film it was the first swedish film i've seen it is simple deep what a great combination br br michael <UNK> did a great performance as a famous conductor who seeks peace in his hometown br br <UNK> <UNK> was great as his inspirational girlfriend to help him to carry on never give up br br the fight between the conductor and the <UNK> priest who loses his battle with michael when his wife confronts him and <UNK> michael's noble cause to help his hometown people finding their own peace in music br br the only thing that i didn't like was the ending it wasn't that good but it has some deep meaning
<START> a true dark noir movie and a very graphic film nice storyline of a man pursuing redemption that may have just left it all too late visually there are some really nice scenes artistically amazing as to what can be done with a minimal budget full marks to <UNK> <UNK> roberts and team i look forward to the next project with new ideas although hopefully more british actors would be great lisa ray looked lovely not seen her before and hope to see her again in the future subject all interesting sex drugs and violence bring it on i would definitely say to rent this one and check it out if you're in the mood for a semi moody noir
<START> in the tradition of <UNK> and <UNK> try a shameless ripoff of not only those two films but 'the evil <UNK> and 'the <UNK> as well ' that said they really don't make bad horror movies like this anymore and that's a shame 'cause it's a gas br br <UNK> <UNK> is the <UNK> substitute here and although she barely does more than <UNK> her lines and occasionally scream you're ugly ' into her haunted mirror she's <UNK> way before it's <UNK> so you have to respect her and she's quite creative about it too <UNK> with black leather <UNK> and a kind of black <UNK> painted <UNK> punch guy hat eat your heart out cher br br karen black overacts a bit but she's not totally without dignity and you can't help but sympathize with her unless you're a certain friend of mine who asked who is that horse lips from <UNK> a s <UNK> ' the first time she came <UNK> br br there are decent supporting performances by <UNK> <UNK> as the square chick who befriends <UNK> ricky <UNK> <UNK> in his <UNK> <UNK> hunk role and william larry <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as some kind of pet undertaker or something but it's sad to see the once <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> reduced to playing what can only be thought of as the charlotte <UNK> part br br the eighties were the <UNK> for hilarious <UNK> dumb horror movies like this and mirror <UNK> was one of the last of its kind definitely worth a look
<START> this movie is about <UNK> a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to <UNK> <UNK> a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead <UNK> we learn after about an hour is also called <UNK> this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our <UNK> about identity psychology and ourselves br br the spirit of <UNK> <UNK> his little to do list killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin by <UNK> the body of a college guy he uses a magic mind control helmet to do this which the college boy willingly puts on his head and then at several points in the movie takes off and puts back on br br maria performs <UNK> sex on a poor man's sean <UNK> scott and <UNK> wears the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has his own green <UNK> for no reason and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient <UNK> tunnel for centuries like this utter misfortune br br this movie is empty and will hurt you see it
<START> this is a bit long 2 hours 20 minutes but it had a a lot of the famous pearl buck novel in it in other words a lot of ground to cover br br it was soap <UNK> at times but had some visually dramatic moments too <UNK> off by a <UNK> attack at the end of the film that was astounding to view considering this film is about 70 years old the special effects crew on this film did a spectacular job br br paul muni and <UNK> rainer were award winning actors in their day and they don't disappoint here both giving powerful performances the only problem is credibility as all the <UNK> are played by <UNK> and some of them like walter connolly just don't look real i'd like to see a re make of this movie with all asian actors not for pc reasons but to simply make the story look and sound more credible
<START> even if it were remotely funny this <UNK> <UNK> of a film would still be <UNK> <UNK> stopping just short of digging up the <UNK> corpses and re <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK>  but only just  producer larry <UNK> and the director of the <UNK> <UNK> films use holding the <UNK> as an excuse to crap all over stan and <UNK> legacy <UNK> <UNK> does a fair ollie <UNK> but bronson <UNK> wouldn't reach <UNK> place in a stan <UNK> contest even if they were both spot on the film would be no less <UNK> the less said about the surrounding catastrophe the better makes <UNK> look like a <UNK> <UNK> song
<START> that shall be a documentary i saw it which is forbidden in germany and i have to say that it was the worst documentary i've ever seen it is nothing but one big lie from the beginning to the end who can doubt after this trash that all jews were supposed to be killed in the concentration camps
<START> here's a rare gem for those of you that haven't seen or most likely not even heard of this during the 80s dennis quaid was a hot <UNK> but in the early 90s dennis quaid disappeared from the scene in 1993 he burst back onto the big screen with three movies all of which unfortunately bombed two of those films i liked very much and let me elaborate on one of them br br wilder <UNK> is a crazy flick about two brothers wallace quaid and wilder <UNK> howard whom are fire starters yes they have the power of <UNK> br br wilder has decided not to use his power anymore for anything not useful anyway after a fatal incident during his youth where he and his brother blew up an abandoned house which killed a man who was inside <UNK> to them nowadays wilder is a <UNK> and is married to the wacky <UNK> debra <UNK> who is under house arrest for guess what <UNK> see the movie to understand this better wilder also hasn't spoken to wallace in 5 years because wallace set his hair on fire during his bachelor party br br wallace loves his <UNK> power and uses it for amusement he also runs a carnival and is the head clown when the carnival comes to <UNK> town wallace decides to reunite with his brother and also to see <UNK> whom which wallace has been in love with <UNK> house arrest sees its end but wilder is <UNK> so wallace steps in and the fun begins brother vs brother fighting fire with fire br br some great <UNK> throwing in this flick eat your heart out drew barrymore br br the film also has some really weird yet funny elements like <UNK> fire unit sings songs <UNK> during <UNK> and after <UNK> jim <UNK> <UNK> known as <UNK> pops in as <UNK> redneck carnival buddy wilder <UNK> is brilliantly shot and cleverly put together very off the wall and avant guard br br give this one a look
<START> honestly the concept behind masters of horror had something going for it big time horror directors that are now left aside by the industry being given a chance to direct horror again i was all for it from the start that is until i watched some episodes oh boy it's really bad tv not only does it seem like the directors are being given very little budgets to direct their skits but there seems to be <UNK> as well like shooting in <UNK> for example to make a long story short it's bad both for artistic and reasons financial reasons i cannot help but compare to the tales from the crypt and the m o h episodes really don't stand the comparison <UNK> was good <UNK> is bad according to me here are a few keys to explain it <UNK> was shorter around 25 minutes for each episode than <UNK> 50 minutes per episode i believe it allowed <UNK> screenplays with good ideas <UNK> more often better <UNK> of an episode less chances to let the plot be confusing or boring duration might have been also the reason why the budget was better spent on <UNK> directors got to have real film music <UNK> <UNK> on <UNK> are if <UNK> very bad real actors whereas on <UNK> it's nothing but unknown actor after unknown actor real directors of photography and it can help sometimes real film cameras while <UNK> is shot on <UNK> cameras with very wrongly chosen lens pieces the result of which being that the episodes of <UNK> looked and felt cinematographic in the sense that there was real actors being casted ranging from michael j fox to tim roth to kyle <UNK> to kirk douglas but there were also film <UNK> behind it of the range of alan <UNK> great directors of photography like dean <UNK> high end screenplay writers and in that sense each tale was a little movie of its own true kind compared to <UNK> the masters of horrors is quite a lame approach to tv horror it's very hard to stand looking at it if your standards regarding cinematography are just a little above average because it looks the same as any ugly tv serial if not worse it gets boring and even annoying incredibly fast within the first 10 minutes usually the actors are never heard before <UNK> except for <UNK> <UNK> robert englund angela <UNK> and a few but even there they are the only famous actors of their episodes the director base for <UNK> was good in the beginning but it's getting worst and worst with every episode now if even the directors are unknown to the world what remains nothing and it's funny how they are starting to have complete unknown directors while they haven't even had say stan winston dick <UNK> william <UNK> sam <UNK> eric red robert <UNK> william <UNK> jim <UNK> stuart gordon russell <UNK> if even masters of horror cannot bring dead directors back to life who will maybe a <UNK> of tales from the crypt will
<START> the title should have been the walker that was only he did walk br br there was nothing on the movie that was good the description of the movie doesn't really <UNK> with the plot br br the only thing that i can get from the movie is that he was a good son but a low life terrible person br br i'm sorry that i <UNK> my money and time on this movie i saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie i stayed hoping that it will better what a mistake i got worse br br if there is a suggestion that i can make to he producer is to re direct his life to another field because making movies is definitely no his cup of tea
<START> this show is awful no comedy no plot no good characters america are you blind give the award to real shows i hate this show along with 30 rock honestly i'm so glad they canceled this show thank you cbs keep two and a half men keep christine keep rules of engagement keep how i meet your mother which really isn't funny but a lot funnier than this this show is a rip off of friends with the same director so thats okay but keep this show gone and never bring it back never ever ever ever the only reason i didn't give it a 1 rating is because it keep my awake instead of asleep those are the types of movies or tv shows that i give a one the only reason i was still awake was because of the audiences laughter and i was looking forward to the next show i really wish this show was funny sorry but my opinion stupid very stupid i don't see why everyone loves it my opinion again but i also find big bang theory kinda stupid my bad smart the class bye bye now i have a smile and it is not from watching your show
<START> every movie critic and metal head hated this movie but i enjoyed it i saw this as a child on tv somewhere and was amazed by the scene where sammi comes on stage and plays trick or treat by <UNK> br br the movie itself was typical 80's guy gets pushed around by bullies and <UNK> supernatural help to beat up the bullies but goes to far and has to be destroyed br br matt from <UNK> place picks on <UNK> from family ties so <UNK> gets a record of tony fields from gene simmons to comfort him and all hell breaks lose the highlight being where tony sings lip <UNK> and dances to a metal song before the <UNK> hits the fan br br there were a lot of errors and stuff but the music and the overall imagery was enough to keep my <UNK> <UNK> 8 out of 10
<START> i love westerns i could watch them all day the good the bad and the ugly is my all time favorite i watched <UNK> for probably the <UNK> time just the other day because it was being featured on <UNK> however this movie <UNK> falls is without a doubt the worst western i have ever watched the acting was terrible all around they explain nothing at the end of the mysterious <UNK> looking thing the only good part i can think of is the good looking <UNK> girl the very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length this movie wasn't even worth the new rental <UNK> i paid at our local movie rental store i felt like i was robbed and deserving of a rental <UNK> if there was such a thing only reason i finished it was because i hate to not see a movie through to the end i turned it off half way through because it was so bad to the director please do a better job if you decide to make another this is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to westerns
<START> like most people i was drawn to buy this film because of the pictures of the mighty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> all over the box and the <UNK> from the aforementioned pictures and the title of the film that this film is all about the beast from the east <UNK> ass for 90 minutes br br however to my disappointment chinese <UNK> is to <UNK> <UNK> what no <UNK> no surrender was to jean claude van damme and <UNK> tiger was to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> maximum exposure on video box minimum actual screen time oh well br br the storyline is pretty basic stuff but it was well done peaceful kung fu fighter played by <UNK> <UNK> min accidentally kills a man and promises never to fight again he then runs away to work as a <UNK> on a <UNK> where he <UNK> his co workers with his heavy sack <UNK> <UNK> causing them to suspect him to be a <UNK> fighter dont quite know how that works but never mind meanwhile the corrupt boss of the <UNK> does a deal with gangsters giving them <UNK> use of the <UNK> as a result the workers are thrown out on their ear and forced to live on the beach where they <UNK> against their boss the gangster boss and his <UNK> henchman <UNK> <UNK> br br while the film was quite watchable mainly through waiting for the next glimpse of <UNK> i had a few problems with it firstly the bad dubbing but of course thats a given in old kung fu films but also the film tended to drag between the various fight scenes and as for the fight scenes themselves i found them to be over long badly choreographed apparently by jackie chan badly shot and at times performed by people who didn't seem to have any martial arts ability in fact most of the fights in this film weren't <UNK> at all just people getting beaten up without offering any resistance br br finally the hero played by <UNK> <UNK> min i've never seen any other films with this guy in but at no point was i rooting for him not only did he look <UNK> and on the verge of tears at all times but i found his <UNK> on not fighting <UNK> i understood his reasoning but he could have saved a lot of people a lot of pain if he had done earlier what we all knew he was gonna do eventually and fight a bigger mystery was why this entire community of people were <UNK> their hopes on a guy they've never even seen fight br br really the big saving grace in this film was the presence of <UNK> <UNK> not only is he as huge and brutal as ever he has some great funny lines and gives the rest of the cast a master class on how to fight on film the guy <UNK> screen presence and you can easily see how he became a star the guy scares the life out of me but i'm sure i wasn't the only person to have watched this film who was rooting for <UNK> all through the end fight br br all in all then a below average kung fu film lifted several huge <UNK> due to you know who i've never met a person who didn't think <UNK> <UNK> was great the man's a legend
<START> with a special <UNK> dr <UNK> rukh boris karloff successfully proves that years ago a <UNK> landed in africa containing an unknown but extremely powerful element dr <UNK> bela lugosi form an expedition led by rukh to locate the element unexpectedly rukh discovers <UNK> x even more powerful than <UNK> and very <UNK> and karloff becomes <UNK> and can kill anyone by just touching them the sparks really fly between lugosi and karloff in this classic science fiction film during the post world war ii era director <UNK> used a few standing sets from flash gordon series which was being filmed at the same time and also inserted some footage of <UNK> machines from frankenstein universal kept the public unaware of the special effects being used in this great classic film karloff and lugosi were at their very best and they both enjoyed working together and will be enjoyed by future generations
<START> i have things to come on d v d and it's very clear compared to my vhs version the audio is fair but can be hard to understand at times br br i liked the movie so much that i searched for a copy of the book and found it it gave details of why some things happened the best things about the movie are the small things that i didn't notice at first such as john <UNK> playing with a toy airplane at a <UNK> party like it was a dive <UNK> out <UNK> sea power by <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> ships sunk by air power an <UNK> enemy sneak attack by <UNK> swept flying wing planes strong rolls for the women through the entire movie br br there are more see the movie to enjoy them
<START> i have never seen the 1973 older highly rated version i am a nicholas cage fan by the way fine acting as usual this movie probably took all of five minutes to hammer out the whole plot i can see it being done on a cocktail <UNK> at a dinner party if you can't figure out the ending of this <UNK> in the first thirty minutes you will probably find this movie entertaining this is of late the terrible <UNK> that hollywood seems to have <UNK> for itself with the horror mystery thriller genre unable to give the audience enough credit and write a fresh smart and <UNK> screenplay they dish out some creepy music and throw in a couple of things to make you jump a little and then send the final print off to your local theater at least it didn't have the <UNK> hand held camera syndrome
<START> netflix should mention this short feature on the info for <UNK> <UNK> superior in every way to that over produced fluff this had much better cole porter songs and lots more energy <UNK> <UNK> turned out to be a big disappointment fred was getting too old for this sort of thing though the dances and <UNK> are lovely i will be on the watch for the garbo melvyn douglas version of <UNK> was peter lorre ill during the making of <UNK> <UNK> he seems to be very passive in the more active numbers and with less lines very glad that i ran across <UNK> <UNK> by pure accident made the whole experience a lot more enjoyable bob hope as a simple song and dance man' is pure joy
<START> i actually have a <UNK> for christopher lee but this just wasn't up to his other performances and he was one of the better actors br br the film does not live up to its premise it's not that scary it's overly melodramatic and it <UNK> every time i thought oh here comes the good part the good part never quite arrived br br the evil ones aren't at all convincing most of the other characters were also lacking in depth br br perhaps if i'd been in the proper frame of mind i might have enjoyed some <UNK> <UNK> at this film's expense but <UNK> didn't really seem to be worth the effort it wasn't really very good it wasn't really very bad it was just mediocre
<START> okay here's what i think about jack frost i looked at the <UNK> box for the vhs tape and i thought to myself this looks interesting i rent it and i take it home boy was i right it is interesting they put serial killer's spirits in dreams in walking corpses and inside every day machines but this has got to be the most unique place to put the spirit of a serial killer inside the body of a snowman i liked all the friendly snowman images <UNK> the landscape the pot <UNK> the snow globe etc i like the actor who played jack he put some fun into a killer really not seen since freddy <UNK> that's right i said it freddy <UNK> it's that level of cool i wish some of the puppet effects were better the mouth movements could have matched better but i <UNK> that up to a small budget the cast does a great job there are some great one liners and scares to make any hardcore horror fan jump all and all a great story good effects great dialog and a great cast i give jack frost 9 stars
<START> this movie appears to have designed as a fred astaire ginger rogers film the plot outline dance numbers <UNK> music and the entire formula is there except for ginger whether it really was originally intended as a re pairing of the team is uncertain but it sure has the look of one of these films instead of the usual <UNK> for fred such as eric <UNK> or edward everett <UNK> burns and allen are used probably since despite being known as a comedy team they could sing and dance quite well this actually shocked me but the team were a welcome addition and some of the traditional fred and ginger numbers were done with either fred and <UNK> or these two along with george only once at the very end does ms fontaine dance with fred but it's very brief and with a distant camera shot br br and speaking of burns and allen i think i owe it to the team to talk about them in the film i have never been a fan of their show or their movies in general i find <UNK> idiot act very annoying and i have given some poor reviews to their movie shorts and full length films however in this film i must admit that they were great not only dancing competently but i actually thought they were funny and filled the hole left by edward everett <UNK> very nicely they were on top of their game and the writers did a wonderful job in this department br br now as for the rest of the film it's all a lot of fun and is entertaining the problem for me though was that joan fontaine was not a particularly good choice for the movie not just because she was acting outside her range after all she wasn't a singer or dancer but because she had the screen presence of a ball of <UNK> because of this the usual balance and great boy girl dialog was lacking there was also a very charming performance by harry watson as a <UNK> little boy who did everything he could do to play <UNK> all because he wanted to win a bet and finally i loved the fun house and tunnel of love sequence it is too hard to describe but is so much fun to watch overall i did like the film quite a bit it had a lot of charm and excellent writing unfortunately it also featured a bland performance by ms fontaine that knocks off a point bringing my score for this film to 7
<START> two movies back to back which dealt with indian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> although <UNK> <UNK> was a love story of a guy who gives everything up for someone <UNK> focuses on the main subject itself it is not hidden that many indian <UNK> are rotting in <UNK> <UNK> for years for whom neither indian <UNK> has time or sympathy nor the other side i'm sure some of <UNK> <UNK> are in india as well but let's focus on the movie full of actors some were stage actors like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc amitabh bachchan who plays the role of a major acted well <UNK> <UNK> did his part well there was nothing for amrita <UNK> to do than a few <UNK> and couple songs i think <UNK> <UNK> role was most solid even though it wasn't too long he acted really well here and his dialog delivery was also impressive if you compare it to <UNK> which was nothing but a day long movie with story going in all directions if it had a story <UNK> is a well directed movie that keeps a good pace and does justice to all actors 7 5 10
<START> it's beyond my <UNK> that so much rubbish from <UNK> has been <UNK> for dvd release and still gems like this don't get a shot at <UNK> their past glory i give this a 7 not because it is very good but because it is one of the few scifi films made for norwegian television this film is nothing less than a film historic gem that in so many ways <UNK> the first alien film and my word <UNK> was first did <UNK> scott or anyone in the crew see the mini series however unlikely the fact remains that the scenes are extremely similar okay the budget is much lower in the norwegian film but given that it's a really well done piece of work from the desolate age of norwegian movie making which incidentally lasted until the 90s
<START> i have given this film an <UNK> rating of 2 stars as i personally appear in minutes <UNK> and <UNK> of the film the road side bar scene in russia in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line 50 dollars you drink and talk but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could so i <UNK> to take this speaking part on i was slightly <UNK> as this was my first film experience and who knows these lines could have ended up there with lines such as i'll be back and quite frankly my dear i don't give a damn had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> instead of the name of <UNK> <UNK> br br as time goes on i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film br br even though i spent a whole day on the set in south <UNK> hot spot barry island no one could tell me what the actual storyline was the <UNK> and the wardrobe lady all <UNK> that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it things could certainly have been worse if i'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films br br still on the positive side i got <UNK> to rhys <UNK> during one break i had no idea who he was as <UNK> hill was yet to be released and not an <UNK> that he might be <UNK> made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production
<START> cedric <UNK> films have been character based rather than action based i'm thinking of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> so it is jarring to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with some plodding attempts to give character to <UNK> i don't find <UNK> <UNK> to be an interesting actor he reminds me of pro <UNK> who are <UNK> into movies like <UNK> <UNK> that blank stare looks like a really vicious deer caught in the <UNK> a real actor would have forced us to reflect more on <UNK> personality rather than <UNK> his skill at <UNK> br br the little acting there is comes mainly from <UNK> le <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> takes by storm the interview at the police office is a marvel of bland <UNK> with a little fear of the future <UNK> in le <UNK> apart there is little to recommend this film
<START> this movie has <UNK> horrible ratings from just about everyone who has voted here but i am here to say if you like movies like dude <UNK> my car and dumb and dumber this movie is for you if your into movies like citizen kane and casablanca id have to <UNK> you in a different angle yet i still love this movie and everything about it even if it is kind of <UNK> this is one of the few movies me and my <UNK> have been able to keep watching over the years and quote whenever possible great movie this movie should the <UNK> number 1 because its so <UNK> high class the only problem with this movie is you may have trouble seeing it because it was a made for tv movie on a channel that no longer exists so i dont know how to get this movie id like to buy it for dvd but i cant find it anywhere i still have it taped from when it was first on you can come over if you want and watch it <UNK> i might be sleeping this movie rocks and thats <UNK> all you need to know
<START> i was excited to hear that <UNK> <UNK> had decided to make a movie in the <UNK> language not <UNK> as most <UNK> will <UNK> refer to it as as <UNK> and <UNK> are as <UNK> <UNK> as french and spanish are to each other but i was greatly disappointed when i saw this movie being a canadian of <UNK> parents i was optimistic about the revival of the <UNK> film industry when i heard about this film i was further excited to hear that it wasn't another stupid action movie or melodrama as <UNK> love these types of movies but alas i was short changed br br <UNK> serves as an ego trip for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of course plays the hero of the movie and when i say <UNK> i mean in the most stereotypical of manners his function is to win the heart of a girl and lead the <UNK> <UNK> to victory against the japanese his character has no depth or complexity he just fits the hero mold the rest of the characters are one dimensional they all fit their cookie cutter roles br br i'm all for slow moving <UNK> movies but this movie was just slow moving it didn't really <UNK> on anything just because a movie is historically themed a drama and slow moving doesn't make it a well made film br br particularly annoying is the american actor philip anthony his performance was embarrassing br br if <UNK> wanted to revive the <UNK> film industry he should have really thought this through he said he wanted to make <UNK> movies that could compete at cannes and toronto etc but really this movie would have been <UNK> and <UNK> at at such festivals to get <UNK> films into the mainstream consciousness he should have at least made a movie that would have attracted audiences even if it meant <UNK> quality obviously he didn't think about or get information on what kind of movies garner awards at cannes so an audience <UNK> movie would have been at least a foot in the door br br i'm afraid now that <UNK> movies will not be made for a long time again because of this movie if ever i said to a <UNK> that i want to see more <UNK> movies of course i'd get an answer like <UNK> don't make good movies didn't you see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of course this is ludicrous as it is one example of a <UNK> movie and probably the only example that anyone nowadays would be likely to see br br an example of movies that are <UNK> not just slow moving are the <UNK> film <UNK> or david lynch's the straight story i hate to promote the <UNK> language as it is endlessly and unfairly promoted and shoved down the throats of non <UNK> <UNK> but for the sake of calling a spade a spade i say that <UNK> is a very good movie these movies rely heavily on what hitchcock called <UNK> <UNK> images without words are used to convey the story but i bend the definition a bit for the sake of these two movies in that these movies use images without words to convey the mood of the movie and they do it very well <UNK> thinks that if they simply take sweeping shots of the landscape then they have established the mood br br and what's with so many <UNK> movies featuring a dying mother or grandmother
<START> i just watched this movie by mistake what a little gem this film made in 1956 looks and feels like a late seventies movie and is in fact better more restrained and correct than say blue soldier the <UNK> <UNK> undertones are way ahead of its time the understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic much more than dances with wolves the last hunt manages to convey the look and feel of the buffalo killing fields of the late <UNK> probably because those in the movie were real killing fields the movie was shot during legal <UNK> directed buffalo <UNK> so the animals you see are really being shot the bones are real in conclusion a very under rated western masterpiece superbly acted directed and shot
<START> first let's get it out of the way yeah this film steals a lot from <UNK> <UNK> 2003 the plot for <UNK> <UNK> goes something like this the tooth fairy a murderous woman who hides her face due to <UNK> kills people who look at her out of revenge in 'the tooth <UNK> 2006 the <UNK> tooth fairy who yeah hides her face <UNK> her furious vengeance on just about anyone a little too similar to be coincidence br br but what must be asked is this if you're going to directly steal the exact plot from a movie why choose something as mediocre as <UNK> <UNK> sure it made a few bucks at the box office but that was strictly for the fairly okay theatrical experience the film delivered a low budget straight to video movie will not have that same effect and it didn't br br as i watched the opening 15 20 minutes of the film my expectations actually rose there seemed to be at least some production value the story didn't seem terrible just blatantly ripped off past the first scene we get an okay cast of characters including an ex doctor with secrets played by that guy who looks like a busey and some hot <UNK> student <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> of horror <UNK> after those few minutes however the film just slowly goes down the drain it serves all the basic horrible clichés including but not limited to some crazy old person with an <UNK> warning the buff dumb jock the psychic and the stripper with the heart of gold br br one of the biggest problems this film had was its inability to stick with a target audience it's kind of like the filmmakers wanted to change the tone for whatever character was on screen at the time when the adults were on screen it had a more mature feel when star the stripper and <UNK> the jock were on screen the dialogue went down to a more stupid <UNK> immature level when the kid was on screen it felt like an episode of <UNK> you afraid of the dark ' only less scary br br technically the film is all over the place the visuals range from fairly good to plain boring the writing is <UNK> as is the acting for the most part on the plus side there's some excessive gore at parts including a fairly cool yet painfully predictable <UNK> scene and a pretty vicious <UNK> scene also if you're looking for a bit of the sexy stuff there's a brief topless scene but if you want to see this chick topless there are better films to do that other than that there's not much to bother with when it comes to this film br br if you're a huge fan of <UNK> <UNK> do those exist maybe you can check it out to see the story done in a different way but that's about the only reason i can find to see this one br br final verdict 3 10 <UNK>
<START> red eye starts in texas where hotel <UNK> lisa <UNK> rachel mcadams is about to catch the last <UNK> <UNK> flight back to miami where she lives works while waiting for her plane lisa meets the handsome charming jackson <UNK> cillian murphy they both seem to hit it off then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are <UNK> next to each other once the plane takes off they are in the air jackson reveals who he really is that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to <UNK> the <UNK> security secretary charles <UNK> jack <UNK> they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in miami jackson tells lisa to phone the hotel make it happen or her father will be killed br br directed by wes craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as the last house on the left 1972 a nightmare on elm street 1984 the <UNK> and the <UNK> 1989 the people under the stairs 1991 the scream trilogy of teen slashers a short <UNK> fast paced little thriller like red eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film craven usually makes the script by carl <UNK> makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that i must admit i really enjoyed at only 85 odd minutes in length it's a very quick moving <UNK> straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots some may like this approach like i did while other's may not but i think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick fast without the film <UNK> down any giving you a chance to relax i really liked the plot for red eye sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell it's a film made to entertain for me that's what it did i really liked the two central character's lisa comes across as very likable while jackson <UNK> an obvious play on the name of the notorious victorian serial killer jack the <UNK> is a suitably slimy villain with a cold <UNK> only doing my <UNK> type mentality another plus point is that i didn't think anyone <UNK> overly stupid here everyone actually seemed like human beings the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion i really liked this it's one of craven's better more recent films br br craven turns in a good solid tense tight taught fast paced thriller with an attractive cast some good action a gripping plot he certainly doesn't hang about once he starts the action tension he never lets up far away the most effective part of the film is when <UNK> is holding lisa hostage on the plane once the film switches to miami <UNK> fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but it's still good a special mention goes to rachel mcadams who is absolutely gorgeous in this i could probably watch red eye again just because she is in it looks drop dead stunning those who see wes craven's name attached to red eye expecting a horror film should think again since there's no horror in it at all despite the imdb listing <UNK> as red <UNK> genre i am not sure about the ending on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see lisa kill him in some way br br <UNK> apparently gave red eye an initial budget of <UNK> 000 000 but reduced it to 25 000 000 although it's still a very well made film with glossy production values actually shot in los angeles florida in california the film was supposedly written with husband wife sean penn robin wright penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers <UNK> for younger leads as i have already said rachel mcadams is pure eye candy is a total babe in this worth watching the film for on her own oh she puts in a decent performance too br br red eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that i enjoyed immensely i didn't think i would enjoy it as much as i did i am glad i decided to watch it this definitely gets a recommendation from me rachel mcadams really is hot stuff in this
<START> with the sun shining brilliantly on a quiet sunday that is just about to fully wake up love can be felt in the soft <UNK> that <UNK> past my feet and can be seen in the smiles of the people i walk alongside it is the perfect day to stop off for <UNK> and a <UNK> o <UNK> before heading off to the city of lights and love of course a flight to paris is not reasonably in this humble film <UNK> budget so i had to <UNK> for the next best thing paris je t'aime a collection of 18 short films by a variety of international directors each piece is named after a different <UNK> neighborhood and is a reflection on love careful not to over <UNK> the most powerful and <UNK> of all human emotions paris je t'aime explores love at the many stages of its own game the results are <UNK> romantic and surprisingly consistent and truly what better way to express the fleeting nature of love and how a moment can change your life than with a collection of filmed moments br br the beautifully poetic quote above is taken from tom <UNK> <UNK> saint denis true to form <UNK> run lola run uses time <UNK> photography and <UNK> to demonstrate the entire cycle of love from <UNK> to <UNK> originally shot in 2004 and paired down for this anthology <UNK> stars natalie portman as <UNK> an american actress in paris for a part in a film and <UNK> <UNK> as thomas a blind man she falls in love with here the blind leads the blind through the most unstable of <UNK> where two people <UNK> each other to a point where their lives nearly lose their own <UNK> as love seems to go from dazzling to <UNK> <UNK> reminds us of the tricks it can play on our minds and the <UNK> it can create when we stray towards doubt br br perhaps the most <UNK> romantic offering comes from <UNK> <UNK> tour <UNK> choosing the city's most <UNK> attraction for its title <UNK> les <UNK> de <UNK> gives us a little boy who tells the story of how his parents met and fell in love his father a <UNK> paul <UNK> finds himself falling into one surreal scenario after another and eventually lands himself in jail this is where he meets the woman who will become the love of his life <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has become something of a dying art if it isn't already dead yet by nature it is dreamy and <UNK> <UNK> points its silent finger at the <UNK> of human behaviour and what but love can make people act more absurd we might find someone special in the least likely of circumstances if we could just take ourselves a little less seriously br br paris je t'aime keeps the flow lively by not always focusing on love between lovers three memorable shorts focus on the love between a parent and a child walter <UNK> motorcycle <UNK> has <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> singing lovingly to her child before she leaves him to sing the same song with a distant longing to the child she watches over for her living <UNK> <UNK> un couple <UNK> has juliette <UNK> trying desperately to overcome the <UNK> she feels after losing her son <UNK> says very little yet not surprisingly given her immense talent her struggle is evident in her face as she learns that love sometimes means letting go and <UNK> <UNK> children of men <UNK> in with one continuous shot of a father nick nolte and his grown daughter sara <UNK> walking together for what must be the first time in a long while we see them only from across the street and we only get close to them as the distance between the two characters <UNK> to a place of comfort and accepting br br the last short to screen is alexander <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as usual payne <UNK> takes an ordinary person and shows us what makes them extraordinary carol <UNK> <UNK> is another american in paris she is there alone and for less time than she would have liked as she has dogs waiting for her at home she is a plain person with an <UNK> life who finds herself in a city that is rich and lush in beautifully delivered <UNK> french she <UNK> about the sights and how being there makes her feel this woman spends so much time trying to be happy despite life's numerous <UNK> and as she sits in a city made for lovers she realizes that she is in fact happy and loves herself more than she knew she falls in love if only for perhaps a moment with life and love itself br br the characters that appear but <UNK> in paris je t'aime find themselves at the romantic center of the universe the moments they share with each other be it helping someone up after a hard fall or reaching out your hand to another person without touching them or without their knowledge are the moments that give love its <UNK> and <UNK> outside the city of lovers it can be easy to miss moments such as these but we must remind ourselves of their significance it takes but a moment for love to shine through a <UNK> sky you just have to keep your heart open to see it and if one city can be so <UNK> with love one has to believe it can find its way one day to your door
<START> i have a severe problem with this show several actually a simple list will suffice for now i'll go into more depth later on superficial characters a laugh track and boring humour br br if you don't wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior as if you see anything in this show i didn't to a frequently <UNK> teen from canada i'll <UNK> friends sucks not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the tv audiences for new good shows arrested development <UNK> etc friends is as much to blame for reality tv two and a half men and the king of queens as the television executives now then on with the review br br these characters have no soul they are exactly the same in every way outside of gender and hair colour they react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it why isn't rachel <UNK> out on monica after monica starts hanging out with <UNK> enemy why doesn't joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously oh right cause he's the dumb one and he's comfortable with that this is the curse of having perfect characters lasting conflict and god <UNK> personality becomes an <UNK> br br the laugh track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny how can i make such a broad <UNK> when a show that claims to be comedy requires laughter from someone besides the audience it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it <UNK> destroy humour by <UNK> quick <UNK> humour becomes a <UNK> rather than a free flowing <UNK> see the office arrested development br br this leads to my next point the humour is boring there is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous without a laugh track apparently simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws so what if monica dated a 17 year old she immediately <UNK> that what she is doing isn't right and breaks up with him there has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up <UNK> him that would be great it would be like a custody battle so now i've provided evidence for my position many of my friends love this show because they haven't heard of <UNK> your enthusiasm or arrested development many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching <UNK> your enthusiasm or arrested development br br i have watched very little of friends in my life but i have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show in my opinion completely unwatchable if you've read this far thank you and i hope you at least start watching some of the shows i have mentioned
<START> i'll be honest with <UNK> i was a junior in high school when this sitcom first aired on abc i didn't think i would like it at all but with john ritter in it i felt that it had a little potential in it plus their was something else with it i liked the acting was great not a lot of horrible 2nd rated comedy lines john ritter always brings his a game when it comes to comedy this was a great show to watch and i'll tell you why it was a great show my father who never watches sitcoms at all he just watches movies sports and law order he actually sat down with my 3 brothers and 2 sisters my mother and myself and watched the show i think because john ritter was in it i honestly think this show would still be running if john ritter god rest his soul i wish he hadn't passed away
<START> i had initially heard of tears of <UNK> a while back and it sounded like something i'd be into but with all the films i have coming in on a regular basis it kinda fell off my radar while <UNK> around the local <UNK> i spotted the box for this one and grabbed it up i have to say i'm pretty glad i did tears of <UNK> is a strange gory sometimes downright creepy film which is somewhat <UNK> by it's obviously low budget but is still an entertaining and worthwhile watch br br tears of <UNK> centers around the fictional india based taylor <UNK> cult group that practices <UNK> and other <UNK> in the pursuit of facing and <UNK> the <UNK> inner demons but apparently these techniques work either all too well or not well enough depending on your viewpoint as dark forces are not only <UNK> but also unleashed upon hapless victims br br the film is told anthology style with a short but memorable and eye opening intro sequence and then <UNK> into the three stories that make up the bulk of the film br br the first <UNK> is about a journalist who visits one of the cult members who is being held at a mental hospital the journalist goes in under cover of wanting to research the taylor <UNK> cult but we find that her true motives may hit a little closer to home when the interview takes a violent turn the journalist finds that she may have gotten in over her head br br the second part <UNK> concerns a violent young man who is sentenced to psychological <UNK> in <UNK> of a prison sentence for beating a young man into a coma we find that the treating doctor in question is actually a taylor <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> methods are far from the norm br br the closing story <UNK> revolves around a <UNK> faith <UNK> and his assistant who perform <UNK> for a <UNK> when the <UNK> <UNK> helps one of his <UNK> and actually <UNK> a force which had been <UNK> her the demon is now free to <UNK> and looking for a new host br br i gotta say i really enjoyed tears of <UNK> there are some faults with the film that keep it from being truly excellent but it is an original and ambitious film for what it is my biggest <UNK> with the production is the poor and uninspired over dubbed dialogue the dubbing is sub par and i would have much preferred to have a subtitled option with the original language track some reviewers have said the acting is poor which i don't necessarily agree with i think that the dubbing is so lack <UNK> that it makes the performances seem <UNK> which isn't really the case in fact a few of the performances are pretty damn chilling the doctor in the second segment and the client in the third readily come to mind and notable the gore fx are very well done for a low budget film with some graphic scenes of <UNK> <UNK> via <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> in the throat suicide some decent but <UNK> shaky self <UNK> and a few other <UNK> thrown in for good measure not as rough as some of the more extreme gore films out there but definitely stronger than your average horror fare i also found the story concerning the cult group to be intriguing and a welcome change to the typical horror story nonsense there are plenty of scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension the likes of which i haven't come across in a while although flawed in some fundamental ways i still think tears of <UNK> will appeal to most underground horror viewers some scenes may prove too much for the more mainstream viewer definitely recommended 8 5 10
<START> i <UNK> what the hype around this is this is really a bad movie it did nothing to me the only descent scene is where everyone comes together at the party and a nice song is playing uplifting beat and nice cinematic shots that make you move that was the best part of the movie otherwise this film lacks everything to suck the viewer in there's no story there's nothing to think about like some people say there's no <UNK> between the different stories it was more of an attempt to re do <UNK> <UNK> which was brilliant but it fails blatantly okay it's light and easy to watch but that are <UNK> too maybe first write a story before you make a movie 4 10 one of the worst <UNK> movies i've seen
<START> this movie was very very mediocre and very very gory everyone left their acting lessons at home and totally forgot how to act i mean it was so bad and had no real plot and <UNK> could have written a better story plot wait what story plot not at all scary
<START> so much has been written about the film's plot the wonderful acting performance the script the melancholy bittersweet atmosphere the superb direction what can i add just watch for one of the most heart warming beautifully acted poignant scenes ever filmed it is christmas eve and frank <UNK> character the owner of the shop mr <UNK> is recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt as each of his employees leave he invites them to a christmas dinner each and everyone of them <UNK> turn him down they all have plans for their own christmas eve at this stage there is a deep sadness to this moving scene frank morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears thankfully we have a happy denouement to this very special scene the new employee the <UNK> boy is the last to exit the shop into a beautiful snowy street scene desperately mr <UNK> approaches this boy and asks him how he would love to spend the evening with him he will treat him to all the wonderful christmas food that this <UNK> boy has probably never seen the <UNK> is overwhelmed he too is obviously as lonely as mr <UNK> and together they can have a wonderful christmas meal every time i see this scene it moves me if you manage to get the delightful dvd look at the great trailer with frank morgan introducing himself as mr <UNK> and an appearance by the director of the film the talented <UNK> lubitsch this film is a joy from beginning to end
<START> if you are a fan then you will probably enjoy this if you don't know who misty <UNK> <UNK> caine ruby <UNK> or seduction cinema are this is not the movie to start out with it's very cute silly the girls are hot and it's fun to watch there's no sex whatsoever until the very end of the 45 minute film but the score is cheesy <UNK> and the <UNK> not a total bore misty <UNK> makeup is bad in this movie and her hair is in awkward <UNK> so she's not as hot in this as she has been in others but her <UNK> in this are quite cute you'll just have to see the movie for that to not sound really weird if you do like this one you will probably enjoy that 70's girl vampire <UNK> or erotic survivor which is a bit more sexually graphic if you prefer watching misty or <UNK> in less sexual more horror exploitation based but lower budget movies check out the factory 2000 website
<START> it should be against the law not to experience this extremely funny stand up show with eddie murphy i have never seen anything like it br br murphy goes on for almost 70 minutes about <UNK> <UNK> tits and <UNK> so many famous people including his own family among the people who gets it by murphy are elvis mr t michael jackson <UNK> wonder mick jagger <UNK> <UNK> and james brown i have seriously never laughed so hard of anything my entire life i mean when a person doesn't know who mr t is but still laughs so hard of murphy as mr t there's something about it at the time i saw the show i couldn't remember who mr t was but still laughed now i know who he is and that just makes it so much more funny because that's what eddie do he can make those impressions so good that it don't matter who the hell he's trying to do it's still hilarious and on top of that we learn that murphy actually is a very good singer please watch it
<START> i watched elephant walk for the first time in about 30 years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior rebecca as others have said you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the <UNK> only to find her marriage threatened by the <UNK> memory of a larger than life yet deeply flawed relative you have the stern and <UNK> servant a crisis that will either <UNK> the couple together or tear them <UNK> apart <UNK> by the fiery destruction of the lavish <UNK> br br meanwhile elephant walk also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to the letter the bette davis love triangle set on a <UNK> rubber plantation rather than a <UNK> <UNK> tea plantation br br <UNK> gives elephant walk just two stars and imdb readers aren't much <UNK> but i enjoyed it despite its predictability elizabeth taylor never looked <UNK> and peter <UNK> does a credible job as the basically good man unable to shake off the influence of his overbearing father dana andrews a favorite in laura and the best year of our lives is wasted as <UNK> frustrated admirer the real star is the <UNK> one of the most beautiful interior sets in movie history
<START> if only all animation was this great this film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects story and character the characters in this film are beautifully <UNK> i felt for all of the characters and human animal relationship in the movie works perfectly the beautiful animation and 3 d computer animation hasn't worked better in any other film this is a great movie for kids and for adults who want a classic hero's journey 8 of 10
<START> i've seen this film more than once now and there's always someone complaining about the obvious construction of the plot afterwards but then this is part of <UNK> game he plays along with the rules of genre br br it's very nice how the highly improbable story of how the two girls <UNK> <UNK> meet is again <UNK> in another even more improbable story that the girls make up for a casting this film is a journey between fact and fiction it's more about <UNK> things that might have happened in the past or might be happening in the future than it is about actual <UNK> it's a <UNK> sorts of so apt enough there are a lot of motives <UNK> might have found interesting for his dream analysis like all the <UNK> <UNK> br br also i think <UNK> might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current asian cinema of the uncanny <UNK> everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an <UNK> strangely familiar way this film is not about the obvious to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers or as the story of an <UNK> mother who <UNK> europe for her lost daughter clearly doesn't say much about the nature of <UNK> at all
<START> second feature concerns a young woman in london desperate for a job happy to accept live in <UNK> position with an elderly woman and her son thrillers about people being held in a house against their will always make me a little uneasy i end up feeling like a prisoner too but this rather classy b film is neither lurid nor claustrophobic it's far fetched and unlikely but not uninteresting and our heroine nina <UNK> is quick on her feet <UNK> this in 1986 as dead of winter proved not to be wise as the plot elements are not of the modern day julia ross is extremely <UNK> too short at <UNK> minutes but it stays the course nicely until a too rushed climax which feels a little sloppy from
<START> any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake alex baldwin trying to imitate the late steve mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn't work while baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish mcqueen had charisma never try to compete with a star as for kim in the role of ali <UNK> enough said mcqueen looked dangerous menacing and believable as doc the film had excitement and suspense baldwin and company made this into a comedy i laughed the one and only time i saw this miserable film and that dreadful <UNK> for michael madsen who is one of today's more exciting and believable actors did the makeup people have it in for michael what were they thinking if you wish to see movie making the way it was under sam <UNK> direction get the original
<START> if this guy can make a movie then i sure as hell can make one too br br in fact if you hire me to make a movie for you i promise to do the following br br 1 i will add more naked women this movie had none i think cheesy b class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body i wouldn't want to let my viewers down br br 2 i will <UNK> from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it's only a dream i think <UNK> had about 4 of these scenes and considering the movie was only like an hour long the dream to movie length ratio was quite high and if i do decide to do a dream sequence i will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on i mean who sleeps in leather pants br br 3 i will not rip off any movies like star wars or the matrix because i will know that my budget is small and i will not want to mask my contempt for big budget hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine br br 4 and finally i will not mix modern technology with the undead i mean a palm pilot can only be so scary at least they turned it into an evil <UNK> polly monster before the screen blew up or something br br so if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production count on me wanna b movie director <UNK>
<START> fred astaire and ginger rogers hollywood's premiere dance team were usually dressed to the <UNK> and <UNK> through <UNK> exaggerated art <UNK> sets in the 1930's however they go a bit more <UNK> for this 1936 outing the fifth of their ten musicals together this time astaire <UNK> his top hat white tie and <UNK> to become a <UNK> chewing sailor named <UNK> baker and rogers plays dance hall entertainer <UNK> martin who was <UNK> partner dancing and otherwise before he <UNK> consequently unlike the mistaken identity <UNK> and romantic <UNK> prevalent in most of their previous <UNK> they are already a couple from the film's outset br br directed by mark <UNK> who guided five of their <UNK> the film bears a narrative similarity to <UNK> <UNK> in which they are but one of two couples featured in the storyline in fact randolph scott plays the other male lead in both films this time as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> smith he is <UNK> with not irene dunne who understandably turned down this follow up but harriet <UNK> just married to <UNK> nelson in real life and decades before <UNK> harriet <UNK> plays <UNK> <UNK> sister connie who falls hard for <UNK> in the silly plot she is given a <UNK> by a young <UNK> blonde lucille ball and there is s classic three way shot of <UNK> ball and a <UNK> doll adorable betty <UNK> in front of a mirror br br speaking of the story what there is of one is credited to allan scott and dwight taylor and goes something like this <UNK> and <UNK> are on shore leave in san francisco where they end up in a dance hall with their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> finds <UNK> working there while <UNK> runs into connie first when she comes in as a <UNK> <UNK> and then showing up as a <UNK> girl romance <UNK> for both couples connie and <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> from their father but they need money to keep it <UNK> multiple <UNK> occur in both relationships but it all works out when they turn the <UNK> into a theater and put on a <UNK> musical <UNK> it's about as silly as it sounds but it does provide a good excuse for some memorable irving berlin tunes and a trio of astaire rogers dances br br the first two are casual in tone a dance contest set to the <UNK> let yourself go where they show off mercilessly to win and a physical <UNK> comedy routine set to the toe <UNK> i'm putting all my eggs in one basket however their last dance is a classic return to <UNK> with a melodramatic piece beautifully set to a stunning <UNK> of let's face the music and dance <UNK> this movie contains not only an astaire dance solo but the only time rogers ever had a dance solo to herself in one of their movies an energetic tap routine again set to let yourself go dressed in a <UNK> <UNK> sailor outfit she also sings the same song most <UNK> near the beginning of the film br br acting wise astaire and rogers are in typically <UNK> comic form here while scott plays his role with his trademark <UNK> eyed <UNK> <UNK> is an extremely dull presence and as a former band singer she performs two berlin love songs in a <UNK> <UNK> manner regardless the magic generated by astaire and rogers in their prime make this essential viewing the 2005 dvd has several good extras beginning with a thirteen minute <UNK> follow the fleet the origins of those dancing feet about how astaire and rogers started to work together there is also a live action <UNK> called melody master <UNK> <UNK> and his dance orchestra a <UNK> themed cartoon called let it be me and the original theatrical trailer
<START> oh my god i bought this movie and i watched the whole thing okay it's going to be alright <UNK> know i'll be okay in a month or two some time soon i hope to be rid of the flash backs i was going to eat something after the movie but i just can't seem to get up the courage to try and hold any food down at the moment bad yes bad very bad bad bad bad bad bad wait bad doesn't seem to get the message across in quite the right way hmm there isn't a word to describe just how awful not awful hmm <UNK> horribly casted acted filmed directed written now i don't know what to do but throw it out possibly burn it i wouldn't want it to end up at the bottom of an <UNK> dig a thousand years from now the worst movie ever since hey happy
<START> spoilers spoilers released in 1956 and considered quite <UNK> at the time douglas <UNK> over the top candy colored melodrama is still a wonderful thing the plot concerns the goings on in an oil rich dysfunctional texas family that includes big brother kyle who is insecure weak wounded very alcoholic played by robert stack in a very touching <UNK> performance and his <UNK> sister <UNK> played in an extreme manner by dorothy malone ms <UNK> performance is <UNK> to us via her eyes which she uses to show us her emotions which mostly consist of lust for rock hudson and jealousy for lauren bacall malone is the only actress i've ever seen in movies who enters a room eyes first now don't get me wrong her performance to say the least is an absolute hoot and is one of the supreme camp acting jobs of the 1950's but it is also terrible because as likeable and attractive as malone is she's not a very good actress and she's not capable of subtly or <UNK> her <UNK> is of one note she does get to do a wicked <UNK> and in a great montage as <UNK> daddy played by the always good robert keith falls to his death climbing a <UNK> sirk mixes it up with an almost mad malone doing a <UNK> dance as she <UNK> stack who should have won an oscar malone who won the award but shouldn't have are the real stars of the film the ones who set all the <UNK> both sexual otherwise in motion while the real stars of the film hudson bacall fade to grey brown which are the colors that they are mainly <UNK> in hudson who was a better actor then given credit for plays the childhood best friend of <UNK> and the stalked love interest of <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> over rock through most of the film but hudson wants no part of her and instead is in love with bacall who is married to stack no one is very happy no one is happy for very long the stack bacall marriage falls apart big time after a year and stack pretty much drinks himself into oblivion because he thinks he is <UNK> and can't give bacall a baby to prove that he's a man sirk who was a very intelligent man and had a long fascinating career both in films and theatre in germany ended his hollywood career at universal in the mid 1950's with a series of intense vividly colored women's movies or <UNK> although they were mainly adapted from <UNK> or trashy source material in <UNK> hands they became masterpieces of the genre sirk had a wonderful sense of color design which he brought to play in these films filling his wide screen spaces with characters who played out their emotional lives among weird color <UNK> lighting make believe shadows and lots of <UNK> <UNK> in written the characters are always <UNK> out of windows listening at doors or <UNK> around so in the end after much violence an accidental murder a <UNK> more sirk ends the movie with a final startling scene of a <UNK> and <UNK> malone in a man <UNK> suit sitting at a desk <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is a sublime piece of film making it flows at just the right pace throughout the accompanying music fits perfectly and is very pleasant to the ear the humorous parts are hilarious and made even more so by the largely <UNK> tragic nature of the film br br however despite much comment about the inherent tragedy of the storyline it was anything but depressing for me to watch i thoroughly enjoyed it in a way that i haven't experienced for a long time that is to say it is superb and yet without all the common <UNK> of modern films such as sex violence and unnecessary special effects br br <UNK> in real <UNK> lacks nothing for being without the regular <UNK> it has a fully <UNK> plot that just doesn't require and indeed would be ruined by any further <UNK> at the same time the theme is entirely adult it's a piece of art in and of itself that <UNK> you entirely and you want for nothing more than it already offers br br there are some scenes that feel a bit <UNK> but these actually make perfect sense in the long run as they contrast the more dysfunctional moments the <UNK> makes way for the tragic which then gives over to the <UNK> which turns to the darker etc this <UNK> landscape of emotional cinematography creates a perfect balance and keeps the viewer in a state of <UNK> like <UNK> the peaks and <UNK> are gentle but more than adequate in the pleasure they <UNK> br br i highly recommend watching this film regardless of what genre you normally enjoy put aside any prejudices because this is a must see
<START> i love this show as it action packed with adventure love and intrigue well some times love it's so good see a show where all the characters work well together and they treat each other with respect it's also very good to se dick van dyke in a television role as i have only seen him in mary <UNK> the mixture of the main characters mark amanda jesse and steve is very capturing to the audience this is a show you have to watch
<START> what a poor excuse for new <UNK> movie making i'm ashamed to call myself a new <UNK> when this movie exists and is currently playing on new zealand satellite tv <UNK> 2006 the cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars the ship in real life is one of the inter island <UNK> that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> still all over the set including on the <UNK> <UNK> the ship is supposed to be a cruise ship ferry between the usa and mexico it has obvious signs of <UNK> and old age all over the place yet is supposed to be a luxury ship on it's maiden voyage one of the scenes shows the snow <UNK> peaks of new <UNK> south island in the background for god's sake must have been a very cold time on the usa mexico area the story is weak the acting is weaker and the new zealand american accents just don't work i expect the new zealand tax <UNK> contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a waste of money better spent on a real production i know high school kids in new zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones goof there is a truck in the hold with <UNK> on it and they stuck a <UNK> company sign on the door of the truck presumably to make it look like it was american but some of the sign is over the top of the <UNK> you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before <UNK> it i'd love to go on but it just isn't worth the trouble in any way
<START> i am not a very good writer so i'll keep this short world at war is the best wwii documentary that i've seen i've seen different wwii documentaries not only english north american and this documentary seems to be the most complete wwii documentary that i've seen i think it could talk a bit more about the great depression and why how hitler got to power but it does a very good job at covering the war it seems to be complete and objective fair to everyone it does not <UNK> or <UNK> roles of different nations it has a lot of original footage including color footage and many eye witnesses it was made in 70's when a lot more were alive it has great music and narrator all in all i gave this one 10 10 because it's that good i haven't seen <UNK> in dvd version so i cannot comment on those
<START> <UNK> speaking irving berlin gave fred astaire and ginger rogers another <UNK> musical after top hat if that was possible although in this case like that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that they were in follow the fleet <UNK> randolph scott with another singer this time harriet <UNK> br br randolph scott is a career navy <UNK> and fred astaire is an ex <UNK> who <UNK> in the navy to forget ginger rogers his former partner but now the two are on shore leave fred and ginger take up right where they left off and randy accidentally meets <UNK> <UNK> sister harriet who <UNK> into a real beauty but <UNK> a typical love 'em and leave 'em sailor br br again irving berlin wrote a hit filled score with him tightly <UNK> the production ginger gets to do some really outstanding <UNK> with let yourself go which she and fred later dance to but the real hit of the show is let's face the music and dance which is a number done at a navy show sung first by astaire and later <UNK> to by the pair let's face the music and dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen their dancing on this one is absolute magic br br i'm sure that when i mention harriet <UNK> a few younger people might ask who that was but they will know immediately when i mention her in <UNK> with her famous husband <UNK> nelson that's right <UNK> and harriet it's something of a mystery to me why harriet stopped singing when she just became david and <UNK> mom on television then again she didn't even keep her own name br br neither <UNK> or harriet sang on television <UNK> was a pale imitation of <UNK> <UNK> as a singer but harriet could really carry a tune she sings get <UNK> behind me satan and the moon and i are here but where are you both with real feeling and class i recommend you see follow the fleet if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of harriet <UNK> incredibly forgotten today
<START> this was the worst mtv movie awards ever i barely laughed none of the <UNK> were funny the <UNK> really sucked and the parodies weren't so great either why can't we go back to the good <UNK> days when the show was a riot
<START> for me every piece of art is to be judged by these <UNK> form function and meaning <UNK> seems to be dedicated to forms nice shots and sometimes interesting acting the long close ups suggest a function that the viewer may fill in by himself because of lacking <UNK> the story becomes a <UNK> an <UNK> person suggests to have depth but sometimes it turns out he has nothing to say this film acts like an <UNK> person if you have not read the synopsis you cannot see that it was the suicide and the unanswered question why that changes <UNK> view on life and makes her suspicious <UNK> don't you speak to me ' asks <UNK> anna doesn't answer she only starts looking a long time at him without saying a word what is the function of that shot what does it mean my question is like <UNK> what has this film to say what is meant by this movie the answer for me it shows us a handful of persons with the passion of a glass of water the story of their lives is simple and boring motives behind their actions are not shown the rest is <UNK> <UNK> landscapes nice and artistic done but meaningless without having <UNK> of <UNK> for <UNK> in my opinion this film is made for fellow artists not for the common viewer
<START> i enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the <UNK> the script and dialogue is laughable the acting was awful where did they get them from music was ok i have to say luckily i didn't buy or rent the movie but its now <UNK> of br br i was <UNK> up at the beginning when the stranger martin sheen started to tell his story i have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between <UNK> and <UNK> where <UNK> shot <UNK> finger off and told him to <UNK> for 40 years to reach his league but thats where it all went <UNK> shaped thereafter i had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better never did
<START> don't read anything about this movie especially nothing that could contain any spoilers just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it and you'll have a really great experience if you like to see an intelligent twisted story go get the dvd and you'll truly not be disappointed cypher is not really a sci fi movie more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of <UNK> business it's about corporate secrets how big companies spy each others research <UNK> and the methods used by them the actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of <UNK> cypher is much deeper more complex and what belongs the story and the ending also much much more satisfying than vincenzo <UNK> other movies cube and nothing actually it's one of the best movies i've ever seen and that's something i really don't say this about every fifth well made flick sorry can't tell you anything more about this movie without <UNK> to hurt your experience just give it a chance
<START> the reason the dvd releases of this film are in black and white is because nobody can get their hands on a color print of this public <UNK> film a modest sea story at best br br distributed for television thru allied artists dvd's or vhs on the market at this time for this title are all coming from the same <UNK> television print films distributed for television prior to 1963 were often distributed in b w <UNK> because the bulk of viewers did not have color sets anyway striking b w <UNK> for television was also cheaper as it often involved quite a few <UNK> to cover all stations running a film on a <UNK> basis
<START> i like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies it is filled with super <UNK> greg <UNK> home movies and a <UNK> of amateur video from others who <UNK> themselves with his 50 year passion nevertheless it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory it is filled with artistic talent and athletic talent however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic surfers are not <UNK> nor test pilots nor are they <UNK> perhaps or <UNK> <UNK> again perhaps it believes in the quest of the <UNK> it believes in the beauty of human <UNK> it believes in the great gift of peace which comes from the <UNK> of war surfers celebrate the <UNK> of war on the north beach of an <UNK> island attacked by japanese <UNK> fifteen years before it <UNK> the down time of a country which fought a cold war instead of a hot war with the russian <UNK> surfing is the ultimate <UNK> it is dangerous but only slightly historical i suspect alexander the great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique he had to go out and <UNK> a few dozen countries to get the <UNK> press he has received this movie has no military heroes it has no guns the only beach head surfers <UNK> has a beer stand and and a <UNK> shop this is not a problem peace is not desperate it is the joy of <UNK>
<START> it is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest if any without his presence br br despite a not outstanding direction in fact there are many scenes that seem to have been <UNK> too quickly and <UNK> a seemingly low budget a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a <UNK> priest and another week points the presence of pierre <UNK> is so impressive that one gets shocked from the very <UNK> to the terrible end br br i have never seen nor can <UNK> for future a better performance even paul <UNK> acting in a man for all seasons br br actually the end could be considered even ridiculous if <UNK> were not playing the <UNK> priest who returns to church by performing a crime br br je <UNK> maurice <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i am maurice <UNK> a catholic priest is said with such a <UNK> that one may forget the madness that <UNK> to that end br br the other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in <UNK> <UNK> who despite being a <UNK> one is <UNK> a priest <UNK> in a <UNK> a huge amount of <UNK> turning it into <UNK> blood br br <UNK> the man that wants to return <UNK> to the church or replace him by himself has to drink it if he <UNK> want to leave it in the <UNK> he does so in mid of cheers and <UNK> from people who think that he is simply drinking three of four <UNK> of <UNK> br br in next scene the <UNK> between <UNK> and a garbage collector is also remarkable do you carry away men too asks <UNK> who hates himself for what he has just done that would be too much work is the smart answer br br the rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and strangely <UNK> atmosphere created all the time br br i think that le <UNK> is a very strange film but has to be seen by all viewers if the are good <UNK> it is mandatory because it is a very rare <UNK> in film history br br
<START> i wasn't sure when i heard about this coming out i was thinking how dumb is disney getting i was wrong i found it to be very good i mean it's not the lion king but it's cool to see another side from a certain point it was very funny also it wasn't one of those corny disney sequels were the animation sucks it was just like the lion king animation the only thing that <UNK> me was the whole movie theater thing through out the movie not to give anything way but you'll know what i am talking about i also fun that it was cool to have most of the cast from the original to return it was a very good movie over all
<START> saw this film on dvd yesterday and was <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> acting of <UNK> just blew my mind and i was surprised by the whole cast and its superb acting all of the character were so authentic to me i really took <UNK> for christy burns and brenda <UNK> for his mom go and see it you'll cry your heart out but you'll experience a wonderful <UNK> besides it teaches you one important lesson determination is everything you may be a <UNK> in the poor <UNK> of <UNK> but when you are <UNK> enough you will have no problems at all if you can only operate your left foot you are still good enough to be a painter or a writer the worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to <UNK> in self pity it won't get you anywhere and the only person <UNK> pity you will be yourself
<START> this is my first comment this is a fantastic movie i watched it all by luck one night on tv at first 5 minutes i thought it was a b movie but afterward i understood what an amazing product this was br br i suggested to some friends to see the movie only to tell me that it was a bad b movie how wrong superficial <UNK> br br i think that the movie is almost a product of genius the well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time
<START> not that i <UNK> myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed but when i put a dvd in expecting a bloodbath and what i get is one bloody scene the <UNK> at the tail end of <UNK> fake <UNK> and spinning in a desk chair i end up thinking well that's <UNK> minutes of my life gone forever i wouldn't considers this or flower of flesh and blood movies so much as an exercise of will to see if you can sit through them flower of flesh and blood had a few tough spots to watch the devil's experiment did not it was at best stupid and at worst well really stupid perhaps my expectation were too high i put the dvd thinking oh man this is gonna be sick after watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand times i was watching it in fast forward br br two kinds of people would be interested in this film 1 people who seek out <UNK> up films just to see how <UNK> up it really is or 2 horror <UNK> i sought this and the other guinea pig films for the latter reason but even if i fell into the category of the former this film wouldn't <UNK> my boat as a matter of fact i could imagine this film increasing one's blood lust as in would you just kill the b <UNK> already so in conclusion the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes if you want carnage that traditional horror doesn't provide get <UNK> of death sure that sucks too but at least you'll get the blood and guts you expect br br the only reason i can see for anyone <UNK> this crap is because they feel they're supposed to no artistic merit that i can comprehend no reason for it's <UNK> no nothing just a lame attempt to be shocking
<START> i imagine that the young people involved in the making of <UNK> aka the <UNK> plus a bunch of other titles must have felt a little weird being on the set of a horror movie with the man who <UNK> with john <UNK> in the production of a <UNK> play the cradle will rock scared people into thinking that aliens were <UNK> the war of the worlds and directed and starred in the greatest movie of all time citizen kane and now orson welles was starring in a third rate flick about a satanic cult br br there's basically nothing creative about this movie lots of nudity but the background music always proves really distracting even if the movie wasn't particularly predictable it still wasn't worth seeing how low welles had sunk fortunately over the final thirteen years of his life he narrated the documentary bugs bunny superstar about the warner bros cartoons of the 1940s and <UNK> the documentary the man who saw tomorrow about <UNK> i recommend those two but not this one just avoid it br br also starring pamela franklin and michael <UNK>
<START> it is difficult to <UNK> this or any other comparable film of the early sound era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary at times there is almost a desperation as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound surely <UNK> that they will be left by the <UNK> as did happen to some <UNK> tin tin however was <UNK> natural in such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences some were sure to stand out john <UNK> <UNK> from richard ii is a moment certainly worth <UNK> by and large only those with earlier stage training <UNK> confidence however this is over all reasonably entertaining and a must for film buffs especially interested in the silent to sound transition
<START> i've just finished viewing the 1st disc in a 4 disc 26 episodes collection created in <UNK> with the <UNK> film television archive <UNK> entertainment inc so far aside from the 1st episode the image quality is quite good the dvd box is shown on the title page here on imdb br br mr <UNK> is just as charming as when i first saw it 5 years old at the time and <UNK> cox is truly endearing in this role if you're in the mood for quiet comedy that <UNK> up on you as opposed to hitting you over the head you'll treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood although some of the gags are a bit corny most are ingenious and well executed and even the corny ones are fun this is one tv series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it
<START> near the beginning after it's been established that outlaw john dillinger warren <UNK> is an <UNK> rapist another <UNK> of the 1930s is <UNK> in a farm house and surrounded by the fbi second in command <UNK> <UNK> ben johnson <UNK> the situations sticks a <UNK> <UNK> in his mouth picks up two loaded 45 caliber <UNK> and stalks off into the distant house alone bang bang bang <UNK> emerges alone from the house carrying the female hostage the <UNK> dead all in long shot br br if you're enthralled by stories like red riding hood this should have considerable appeal br br oh it's as exciting as it is mindless pretty boy <UNK> meets his demise dramatically multiple <UNK> of the <UNK> code plenty of shoot outs with tommy guns and <UNK> blood all over br br as history it stinks few remember <UNK> <UNK> as an fbi hero partly i would guess because of his name <UNK> <UNK> we all remember j edgar hoover who fired <UNK> <UNK> because he was a rival in the quest for public attention though br br the picture was written and directed by john <UNK> he's the guy who had it written into his contract that should any animals be shot and killed in the course of one of his productions he should be the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the guy a <UNK> gun freak who had teddy <UNK> rough riders in the spanish american war shouting <UNK> from henry v saint <UNK> day and all that br br exciting yes and complete garbage i knew i'd never take him alive and i didn't try too hard neither that is kill 'em all and let god sort them out br br you'll just love it
<START> this movie which starts out with a interesting opening of two hot <UNK> getting it on in the back of a driver less moving vehicle has quite the quirky little personality to boot the cast of seven although one girl doesn't hang around for the <UNK> which is unfortunate because the death <UNK> is already so small as is are all super hot as our story centers around teens <UNK> way out in the desert an odd but effective choice of setting who are hunted down by a creepy man in black <UNK> and <UNK> who drives a black truck it <UNK> many of the vehicle inspired slashers to date the trip joy ride <UNK> <UNK> where the killer's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist the killer himself is quite creepy and we find <UNK> in the extremely likable heroine in jennifer <UNK> look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all black while our <UNK> heroine sports all white <UNK> as <UNK> and <UNK> as it may be director bill <UNK> does some really great things with his camera some neat tricks on screen and the cast tries their absolute best there's enough gore in the low <UNK> to please the gore fans and enough t a from a couple of the girls to please t a fans overall this flick is highly underrated and widely sought out in the slasher movie world as it's proved quite rare to find on video highly recommended
<START> yes as unbelievable as it may be in 1968 a musical won the academy award for best picture and it was the third musical to win that award in a five year period the first being my fair lady in 1964 and then the sound of music in 1965 the difference between my fair lady the sound of music and oliver however is that oliver is <UNK> better no comparison the first two movies are insipid wet <UNK> compared to the remarkably <UNK> oliver the acting is great the songs are great the story is great and the dancing is great this movie is dynamic <UNK> relevant to the human experience and unlike the overblown gangs of new york oliver offers a portrayal of poverty in 19th century london england that evokes sympathy without being condescending oliver reed was a great actor and he proves it in oliver the other actors and actresses especially ron moody and <UNK> <UNK> are equally wonderful and offer powerful portrayals of characters who evoke sympathy and warmth without being caricatures
<START> there's no getting around it this movie is terrible i've seen the old christopher lee fu <UNK> movies i'm familiar with the characters and it's serial origins but it's still just <UNK> however peter <UNK> genius still shines through with his portrayal of <UNK> smith with echoes of sadness tragedy and strength <UNK> through a stoic <UNK> it's a performance i place on par with peter <UNK> portrayal of van <UNK> but done in a <UNK> of the <UNK> screen time of all <UNK> dracula movies if the movie was done in a more <UNK> comic vein like <UNK> ho <UNK> by way of the 1960's <UNK> tv show this could've been something special if you're a fu <UNK> or peter sellers <UNK> this is something you need to see but it's a pass for anyone else
<START> i remembered this show from when i was a kid i couldn't remember too much about it just a few minor things about the characters for some reason i remembered it being really intense also it was on really really early in the morning up in <UNK> i finally after looking around the web for a long time found an episode the first episode no less <UNK> this show was so horrible it was obviously just made to show kids playing <UNK> tag and having a great time the show opens with <UNK> li telling his <UNK> my names not christopher i'm <UNK> li <UNK> warrior we then are forced to watch kids playing <UNK> tag to the song foot loose and not just a quick little bit but the whole song <UNK> my brain hurts just thinking about it oh yeah and as if i couldn't get worse you cant even see the laser <UNK> from their guns its like they're just running around to the entire foot loose song later on after <UNK> goes up into space or where ever they have a crappy laser gun fight to the phil collins song <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ah trust me you don't want to know the rest what can i say the light shines
<START> i was so excited to see this film because i had always heard it was very scary br br what's interesting about it is that it is a japanese film they decided to bring to america but they actually filmed it in japan with the original crew i think this made the film more japanese which is probably why it managed to be fairly successful unlike most japan to america horror movie <UNK> but it also made it a bit <UNK> to american audiences the difference in what scares the japanese culture and what scares the american culture felt present throughout the film this worked well in moments when they meant to capture the nervous fear of the main character a frightened fish in a big busy unfamiliar tokyo pond br br the storyline was quite confusing as well in typical japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing the beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we move constantly <UNK> and backwards until at the end of the film we see the ending and beginning of the whole story this constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me also i didn't think some things were explained so well and i had to ask my friend to explain them to me she had already seen it as well as the sequel which apparently reveals more of the story br br overall there is plenty for american audiences to love tons of freaky imagery and macabre details which a healthy <UNK> of jump scenes
<START> the documentary presents an original theory about guns <UNK> and steel the series <UNK> portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory and defend the theory against common criticism br br i was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series they say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school indeed it does in fact i greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which i have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis br br so if you like knowing why things work if you have taken apart the <UNK> trying to determine how it worked if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how <UNK> are <UNK> you will enjoy this series a definite recommendation
<START> the version i saw of this film was the blockbuster rental with a similar title but a swear word in it br br this film was funny as hell it was also true to the bone if you have ever spent time in hollywood or the area around it you will understand the humor if not you may not <UNK> <UNK> at all br br the story of two people in the business struggling to make it until they finally reach a breaking point it is a rare gem it states it is a drama but it is a drama as much as deer hunter is a comedy br br loren dean is wonderful as always as a supporting actor jamie kennedy was able to hold his own well his performance is <UNK> impressive during the <UNK> scene the only downside was carmen <UNK> but we can't have everything
<START> this outstanding <UNK> independent film is one of the very best of the year 2000 from all south america including <UNK> which is producing an astonishing number of quality films since 1999 in 2000 alone <UNK> released many quality films which broke <UNK> b o records a half dozen were <UNK> acclaimed like this one at important world film festivals after viewing this film one can see how home grown <UNK> films were able last year to <UNK> 20 of its national movie market br br directed by one of <UNK> best directors daniel <UNK> this film <UNK> effects of <UNK> worldwide but <UNK> its impact on <UNK> and particularly the jewish community of <UNK> <UNK> daniel <UNK> is wonderful as the nice jewish boy trying to survive and even succeed in today's business climate hector <UNK> one of the great actors of hispanic cinema worldwide is perfect as simon the jewish father as is the rest of the cast which includes spanish and italian stars br br so many current themes in urban western societies are explored i don't have enough space to go into detail daniel <UNK> cleverly weaves them into the plot with different characters <UNK> diverse <UNK> if this film plays at a festival near you or on video don't miss it
<START> wow what a movie i'm not at all a fan of contemporary italian directors usually i don't like dramas i am not a will smith super fan even thinking that he is a very good actor but this movie it is such a great movie with a such original script and so good direction and so well acting wow it is stunning this movie captured my attention minute by minute and i even did not like the pursuit of happiness maybe also because i did not like the acting of <UNK> son who is a very bad actor while children usually seems all natural born actors i saw him also last night in the day the earth stood still and i confirmed my sensation that <UNK> can't act i don't want to write spoilers and so i don't talk about the story but what i can say is that this movie talks about love death and other feelings which i don't like to watch in movies but this movie is such a super great movie if you have a minimum of heart you'll don't regret watching it
<START> yes talk about bad sequels rick <UNK> stars in this awful third sequel to the once funny and entertaining honey i <UNK> the kids the concept basically plays the same way as the first film but with the adults instead of the kids being <UNK> and the inner house instead of the garden as the universe to explore if you think this sounds interesting think again the movie is boring at best right down an embarrassment at worst br br first of all the continuity of the series has been completely <UNK> down the toilet the only remaining actor of the first movie is apparently rick <UNK> the actress playing his wife has changed the actors playing the kids have changed the ones playing the neighbors have changed you name it they try to make us believe this is the same family but the results are puzzling to say the least br br second the story is a rehash of the first one with not one bit of originality all the few jokes and there's barely any and the dangerous situations presented in the movie are just copied straight from honey i <UNK> the kids br br third problem the special effects i'm sure this has been done on a smaller budget but they are pathetic way way worse than the ones appearing in the rest of the series you're supposed to admire in awe these tiny figures exploring the huge domestic area but you'll probably end up cringing most of the time br br fourth problem to locate the action inside the house is just boring only few things happen and when they happen they are not thrilling at all the first movie was amusing because the kids were dealing with nature the grass and the bugs that live in it in this one the adults which come up as rather boring compared to the kids deal with dust a <UNK> and a <UNK> trap disgusting br br i don't know why the idea of releasing such a trite sequel to the already <UNK> series <UNK> disney's executives except maybe because they needed to cash in without spending five minutes thinking about something new i'm warning you leave this tasteless cash in garbage where it should stay getting dust on the <UNK> shelves
<START> to me movies and acting is all about telling a story the story of david and <UNK> is a tragedy that is deep and can be felt by anyone who reads and understands the biblical account in this movie i thought the storytelling by gregory peck and susan <UNK> were at their best to know and understand the story of david and his journey to become the king of israel made this story all the more compelling you could feel his lust for a beautiful woman gregory peck showed the real human side of this man who in his time was larger than life susan <UNK> fear <UNK> but then <UNK> to his authority as her king was beautifully portrayed by her one could also feel david's anguish the <UNK> that <UNK> spent the night at the gate instead of at home as well as the sadness when he was killed in battle raymond <UNK> powerful and <UNK> <UNK> of the king made me feel his anger the sets were real enough and the atmosphere believable all in all i think this was one of the best movies of it's kind i gave it a rating of ten
<START> i grew up watching this movie and i still love it just as much today as when i was a kid don't listen to the critic reviews they are not accurate on this film eddie murphy really shines in his roll you can sit down with your whole family and everybody will enjoy it i recommend this movie to everybody to see it is a comedy with a touch of fantasy with demons dragons and a little bald kid with god like powers this movie takes you from l a to <UNK> of into the amazing view of the wondrous <UNK> of the mountains in <UNK> just a beautiful view so go do your self a favor and snatch this one up you wont regret it
<START> no wonder that the <UNK> ian <UNK> author of the groundbreaking hitler biography who originally was the scientific <UNK> for this tv film <UNK> himself from it the film is historically just too incorrect the mistakes start right away when hitler s father <UNK> dies at home while in reality he died in a pub in the film hitler moves from vienna to <UNK> in <UNK> while in reality he actually moved to <UNK> in <UNK> i could go on endlessly hitler s childhood and youth are portrayed way too short which makes it quite difficult for historically <UNK> people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man important persons of the early time of the party like hitler s <UNK> friend <UNK> <UNK> or the party <UNK> alfred <UNK> are totally missing the characterization of <UNK> <UNK> is very <UNK> in the film he is portrayed as a noble character who almost <UNK> hitler the script obviously follows <UNK> s own <UNK> over view of himself which he gave in his biography after the war in fact <UNK> was an anti <UNK> and was crazy about his <UNK> but the biggest problem of the film is the portrayal of hitler himself he is <UNK> as someone who is constantly <UNK> has neither charisma nor charm and constantly orders everybody around after watching the film one wonders how such a disgusting person ever was able to get any followers since we all know what an evil criminal hitler was naturally every scriptwriter is tempted to portray hitler as totally disgusting and <UNK> but facts is that in private he could be quite charming and entertaining his <UNK> <UNK> t follow him because he constantly <UNK> at them but because they liked this strange man beyond all those historical mistakes the film is well made the actors are first class the location shots and the production design give a believable impression of the era
<START> bette davis turns in a <UNK> amusing performance as mildred rogers in this 1934 film the film seems rather dated now in 2003 it is no doubt well worth watching for film buffs and bette davis fans but may not have as much appeal for the average movie watcher today it was startling for me to see how young ms davis looks in this move the actors turn in performances which are basically sound and the story is meaningful and interesting leslie howard is well cast as philip carey the club <UNK> medical student this is a film with a strong message about whom we choose to love and why however of human bondage didn't seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally i felt slightly indifferent and detached about the movie after viewing it i have an <UNK> that this may be the reaction that the director was going for you be the judge br br
<START> indian cinema <UNK> cops of two broad categories they are either the honest type or the bad guys the honest guys always shout at the top of their voice and fight the system while the bad cops enjoy for most part but suffer at the end br br this movie at least breaks this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of cops and their lives the direction takes an inside look at the life of a young ambitious cop who the music is interesting and the editing is a trend <UNK> as far as indian cinema goes br br the movie is slow at times and the dilemma which <UNK> faces when it comes to <UNK> is <UNK> at times but i would still give this one 9 10 simply because it has many <UNK> to its credit
<START> this is an excellent little film about the loneliness of the single man <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> is a bit like an <UNK> of robert de niro in taxi driver inspector <UNK> in his <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in being there also peter sellers he is single yet doesn't have a clue how to attract the opposite sex in fact he really makes no effort at all br br he has a <UNK> and <UNK> that defies any hope of ever achieving <UNK> his friend jose garcia as <UNK> is in the same plight yet at least makes a brave effort to <UNK> his extended <UNK> he's 28 and admits he's never had sex br br very good <UNK> shots of paris and <UNK> where the two <UNK> people travel on business they try various <UNK> and places but all to no <UNK> my theory is that they're trying the wrong places they go to more or less <UNK> <UNK> they should try the type that has older people more their own age br br <UNK> increasingly becomes isolated and does a little de niro effort as in taxi driver <UNK> his friend colleague to go and stab some bloke who's pulled a nice looking girl in the nightclub br br worth watching
<START> can i be as simple and primitive in my <UNK> as to simply say i liked it it's reasonably funny by bits it got great stars and it's gorgeous to look at the songs there are about two which are then repeated are forgettable but they get a healthy ironic treatment such as the terribly handsome mr fairbanks exploding into <UNK> <UNK> version of the tender <UNK> miss <UNK> has just rendered there isn't much dancing with all the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> around miss <UNK> and the comedy might be a bit heavy handed but the result still is very uplifting the photography including real <UNK> shots which are a thrill is amazing playing around with different shades of lush heavy gold miss <UNK> is a bit past her prime and on the <UNK> side but still fresh and comfortable in this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> comedy it's pretty much along the line of down to earth with rita hayworth and that one tends to be rather disliked by many so i suppose several people would <UNK> that lady in <UNK> to be outdated and <UNK> but it's a fairy tale and these tend to move along at a certain <UNK> anyhow my suggestion is just enjoy the artwork the costumes the witty script and everything else this film has to offer and stop complaining the film has been released on dvd in germany with both german and english soundtrack
<START> 1st watched 12 24 2009  4 out of 10 <UNK> robert <UNK> miller emotional christmas fluff that doesn't really get specific enough to explain how the real story happened in this factual based incident of a man who is wrongly put in jail trying to get a job for his family to make christmas happen for them the three kids in the family then run away from home on a trek to washington d c to <UNK> the then president of the united states herbert hoover this trek provides some side stories like their positive encounters with a <UNK> and a <UNK> which makes the story kind of like a disney animals on the run movie and doesn't quite fit here at the ending there isn't any details given as to how the president helped the family and this is another <UNK> to the movie in my opinion the movie does eventually bring tears but it takes too long to get to this the movie isn't supposed to have been an original tv movie according to imdb but it has the obvious fade outs that make it look this way  so i'm not sure their information is accurate all in all this is a simple movie that could have been more complex with a happy christmas like story but <UNK> played and without a lot of substance
<START> sex wish was actually released minus ten minutes of more <UNK> <UNK> footage here in the uk back in the early days of the video boom and caused a <UNK> storm in a <UNK> when it allegedly inspired a <UNK> murder case strangely enough the papers <UNK> this ultra disturbing flick under the carpet in their <UNK> rush to get the <UNK> <UNK> likes of frozen scream and night of the demon <UNK> and the film has been all but forgotten as a result i jumped at the chance to watch it on a dvd <UNK> and spent most of the film's duration with my jaw on the floor it's not so much politically incorrect as utterly demented a triple x take on michael <UNK> death wish did the title kind of give the game away as far as inspiration was concerned with hardcore sex and some truly nasty violence thrown into an already <UNK> <UNK> of seventies sleaze if you don't consider yourself to be <UNK> this may force you to think again by the time sex wish is over you'll want to <UNK> your <UNK> clean with <UNK> and take a long hot shower to <UNK> yourself if any film truly deserves the it's only a movie only a movie only a movie tag line it's this one br br highlights or <UNK> a rapist using a <UNK> on a victim as he <UNK> over her harry <UNK> scene stealing <UNK> the helpless young black couple who are forced to screw in front the sword <UNK> killer they'd have won oscars for their entirely credible performances if the academy had gone mad before the man is <UNK> for his troubles and some <UNK> slick direction that threatens to lift the proceedings above their obvious <UNK> house origins don't say i didn't warn you if you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago sex wish will prove you very very wrong
<START> there have been several films about zorro some even made in europe e g <UNK> <UNK> this role has also been played by outstanding actors such as <UNK> power and anthony hopkins but to me the best of all times has always been reed hadley this serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western where you will only discover the real villain don del <UNK> at its end the serial also has good performance of various actors of movies b like ed <UNK> ex tarzan jim pierce c <UNK> shaw eternal villains like john <UNK> and charles king and a very good performance of hadley as zorro he was quick smart used well his whip and sword and his voice was the best for any zorro
<START> this production has absolutely no storyline the acting is embarrassing the promising dutch television sophie <UNK> star should not add this movie to her <UNK> her acting is far from flawless and personally i think she has crossed <UNK> of professional decency relating to the way she exposes herself in this movie this movie contains too much unnecessary nudity vulgar sexual scenes and rude language it also shows a wrong image of the <UNK> as most movies do do not bother to watch this movie a waste of time a waste of money and an embarrassing record for <UNK> who has proved to be better with her close on on the screen
<START> i just saw hot millions on tcm and i had completely forgotten this gem ustinov creates a clever and <UNK> plot that has him cleverly going from two bit con man to ingenious well you'll see maggie smith is perfect as the bumbling secretary neighbor who has a tough time holding a job but has a warm and vibrant personality that <UNK> through in this picture she creates a fine portrayal of a warm witty and real person who in the long run well br br <UNK> and <UNK> as top executives take on the challenge of making what could be banal roles and make them come out into a comic life of their own br br robert <UNK> and <UNK> romero are just a pleasure to see and i know at least in romero's case ustinov is <UNK> a helping hand of work br br this film is meant to be a shot back at the rising computer age and it's problems for the average con man or man for that matter but in fact the characters are so involving and so much fun to watch that the computer sub plot is almost lost i say almost br br let down your usual expectations of modern comedy and look for the great performances and friendly <UNK> and deeply involving plot in this picture
<START> laurence fishburne is a fine actor and deserves respect for trying this but he is not in a class with the great <UNK> like olivier and welles and he further suffers from kenneth branagh this <UNK> always brilliant <UNK> steals the show away olivier recognized that potential in his production and cast <UNK> with someone he knew he could <UNK> i didn't nearly realize the possibilities of <UNK> shakespeare's most evil character but branagh shows us the depths nice to see the views of <UNK> too
<START> hayden <UNK> and jessica alba two of my least favourite actors of this century team up in what is quite possibly the <UNK> attempt at remake the already dire the <UNK> effect awake is so dull and so utterly uninteresting that you'd be better off asleep <UNK> howard still recovering from the diabolical august rush puts up a decent fight as the sadistic doctor who seems hell bent on killing <UNK> and after viewing his performance i would gladly <UNK> br br alba still recovering after fantastic four rise of the silver <UNK> is naturally disastrous and equally unwatchable as she always was only once has she ever been rather brilliant at that was in the safe hands of master director robert rodriguez in sin city could it possibly be that jessica alba isn't as poor of an actress as most give her credit for and is is possibly that her acting abilities are being weight down by a poor script if so then that would explain awake what with a script that would shame that of plan 9 from outer space br br jessica alba hayden <UNK> and <UNK> howard star in first time director screenwriter <UNK> <UNK> nerve <UNK> psychological thriller about a man who experiences the <UNK> common <UNK> phenomenon known as aesthetic awareness in which those laid out on the operating table remain <UNK> aware of what is going on around them despite remaining completely <UNK> and unable to cry out for help when a successful young young man <UNK> goes under the knife and realizes that the <UNK> hasn't quite done its job the horror quickly sets in as his worried wife alba waits <UNK> and a terrifying drama unfolds in the operating room br br hoping to do for operating tables what final destination did for planes this first effort from director <UNK> harold <UNK> on a blood <UNK> <UNK> the pre credits sequence tells us one in 700 people suffers from a phenomenon known as <UNK> <UNK> where the patient remains conscious but <UNK> during surgery one such unfortunate individual is <UNK> <UNK> jr hayden christensen who finds himself wide awake during a heart transplant and he can feel every single slice br br <UNK> inventive as it <UNK> away at his tortured psyche awake fails to <UNK> true terror into its novel premise <UNK> from chilling simplicity into absurd conspiracy it's <UNK> by stilted turns from christensen and jessica alba you'll wish you'd popped a <UNK> before <UNK> br br verdict awake is at very best extremely <UNK> a pull no punches film that undoubtedly looked better on paper as a film though its awfully generic and extremely derived awake fails to <UNK> terror into its novel premise the end result is really quite lousy alba and christian are the very least of your <UNK> as the films main flaw lies in its inability to scare its audience awake is a film you'll most likely sleep through
<START> yes there are worse movies out there most of them made for fun on a shoe string budget or as a t v movie of the week but even if this was the <UNK> of the <UNK> it would rate no more than two stars it is a poor movie about a serious subject featuring an abused woman who <UNK> the king of the <UNK> people in to the protective arms of the king of the <UNK> people if this is an attempt to show that she doesn't need a man to protect her than <UNK> man is <UNK> to the film and ought not to be in it at all it has no suspense no character development and an heroine that could be <UNK> by a <UNK> <UNK> i think she <UNK> her wedding ring on a boat with a self contained tank rather than just dropping it overboard in the ocean where her body should be anyway and after the husband finds her <UNK> that she is a moron she still makes childish <UNK> that lead to almost getting her killed i am always amazed when i see the sort of generally high rating a movie like this gets and it makes me realize that dr seuss still has a huge <UNK> market of people who would be challenged by his work after i get done <UNK> at humanity i <UNK>
<START> many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie gackt hyde and wang lee <UNK> is very famous singer in japan but don't judge it before you watch is what i say gackt and staff are very serious when made this film and they worked so hard it's a good film with a <UNK> story inside several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad they made it so good until i can't stop watching this all over again br br the story has written pretty well but i admit that their act are little disappointing this is especially for hyde because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language japan but it's <UNK> because this is their first time to act in the movie br br i think gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life when <UNK> was killed when sho asked <UNK> to turn <UNK> che to being vampire like him because he won't let her die when <UNK> brother died <UNK> shoot son die and the best and beautiful scene is when sho pass away even i told that <UNK> skill is still weird but i give him two <UNK> up at that scene br br there's a time where the plot goes too fast like they didn't tell the reason why son can join the local mafia and being <UNK> enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also son is <UNK> brother in law br br whatever i love this movie very much br br this is an action movie with a touching beautiful story
<START> a <UNK> game uses the game of golf in a country club setting to illustrate an <UNK> discovery about honesty prejudice and other life lessons several times i thought i knew where this film was heading only to be proved wrong unfortunately i'm not so sure that the filmmakers ever knew where it was heading either the defining moment in this movie is probably the scene in which gary <UNK> <UNK> the karate kid and <UNK> any notions that he's going to become a mentor to the adolescent <UNK> it's refreshing in a way that this movie refuses to follow most of the simplistic and over worked movie <UNK> however too much of it still comes off as contrived at the drop of a hat people drop all <UNK> of <UNK> or fail to stick up for the things in which they believe or are exposed for something far less respectable than their place in society assumes unfortunately there is often no resolution to these moments and except for the fact that the club serves as backdrop for them there is no real continuity or <UNK> of them it's a shame that the writers and director could not salvage a better film especially given some of the talented actors and potential in the setup
<START> the only scenes <UNK> made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it the crazy <UNK> the rest of the movie was just boring in the first hour or so nothing really happens jokes which supposed to be funny aren't and zeta jones douglas is really overacting julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck yeah right into the girl next door where did i see this before who gets the guy for short i really didn't care what would happen with the main characters if cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more <UNK> to watch
<START> my mother keeps a <UNK> of this film as a general threat to any film loving person who <UNK> her everything about it stinks br br as such it is a true classic br br who gave it 10 10 were you inadvertently watching a good film and accidentally voted for this one br br everyone involved in the movie making process should be forced to watch at least a small section of this film it should be an <UNK> <UNK> on the minds on all that hold film sacred and be <UNK> as the tide mark of the <UNK> dire
<START> strained comedy a sketch like <UNK> which was initially a vehicle to showcase one time radio star jack pearl but is now best remembered as america's introduction to the three stooges actually larry curly and moe are billed alongside comic ted <UNK> as ted <UNK> and his three stooges although the supporting cast features jimmy <UNK> who is completely wasted on dim material and <UNK> <UNK> the only audience for the film these days are stooges <UNK> and even they won't find much to applaud here incredibly loud and overbearing it shows how far hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of slapstick sophistication 1 2 from
<START> i've joined imdb so people know what a great film this is it's not often you come across a film that's moving and visually cinematic yet humble you've read the plot so all i want to say is don't watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity <UNK> because that's the typical <UNK> people read in to instead just appreciate and realise it's about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles buy it and pass it on before <UNK> get round to it this was one of the very few films to be nominated for a <UNK> being independent and foreign the beauty of it is that it manages to appeal to anyone even if you never watch anything subtitled or just used to the hollywood formula just a great story that will keep you engaged the only thing i wish is for it to be longer and see what happens
<START> a truly disturbed <UNK> psychopath john gary kent under the <UNK> michael <UNK> who lives in a cave stalks <UNK> who make the unfortunate mistake of <UNK> in his wilderness steve dean russell and his buddy charlie john <UNK> get into a playful argument with their wives sharon <UNK> <UNK> the late real life wife of gary kent <UNK> ann <UNK> over surviving in the woods camping by themselves to prove a point the <UNK> decide to head for the wilderness out of los angeles for a camping trip disturbing their partners to the point that they soon follow afterward falling prey to john <UNK> is soon killed as sharon runs for her life as the men arrive late to the wilderness due to their <UNK> <UNK> afraid tired and paranoid sharon receives some very unusual assistance john's ghost children that's right john's children remain in the wilderness ghostly <UNK> which spy on those who exist in the woods taking a special liking to sharon helping guide her to safety and her friends meanwhile steve and charlie soon find shelter from a down pour and the darkness of night in the very cave where john lives cooking over a burning fire the meat <UNK> is actually from charlie's wife <UNK> <UNK> charlie eats from the meat when offered by john who finds the <UNK> inside his <UNK> place anyway soon worried about their wives steve and charlie set out to find them as morning breaks meanwhile john goes a hunting with charlie steve and sharon in a fight for survival when steve suffers a compound <UNK> stumbling between two massive rocks over a flowing river he will be handicapped only increasing such an already nightmare scenario with sharon following her ghostly young friends to potential safety they even at one point <UNK> with their father to not kill her charlie unfortunately doesn't have such friends br br director donald jones who also wrote it and went broke funding the film <UNK> shoots the film in such a breathtaking gorgeous location in the <UNK> national park in california where those <UNK> trees tower to great heights and i basically watch backwoods slashers for this very purpose for some strange reason i didn't particularly find jones' direction of the setting very atmospheric the dread was missing although there are some rather disturbing attacks by john using his knife shot in a clever way jones' camera suggests more than what is actually on screen yet somehow still achieves that gasp at what john is doing to victims within such a <UNK> landscape to see <UNK> <UNK> upon by a maniac that kind of <UNK> the terror city folk attempting to spend a nice few days in a different place to smell the clean fresh air enjoy the sights of a lovely view only to find themselves stalked by a creepy predator with a very <UNK> knife providing the back story to why john is the monster he is jones allows us to witness his memory flashback in discovering his wife's adultery and <UNK> <UNK> she is also a ghost in the wilderness looking for her children wishing to <UNK> them for being naughty killing both her and the lover in bed a <UNK> <UNK> the children sad and depressed committed suicide and now haunt the wilderness still <UNK> with their <UNK> or whoever they so choose i realize such a novelty as ghost children in a backwoods slasher is unique and appreciated by some but i found the idea rather hokey and too silly to take serious they do help our heroine escape a few potentially dangerous situations but it was awfully hard for me to keep from <UNK> <UNK> the music i found <UNK> 80's and the performances aren't mind blowing i mean i could react to the situation they were in because it is indeed quite terrifying to find yourselves in an unfamiliar and hostile territory being hunted by someone who knows the area so well i think the film is similar in many ways to don't go into the woods alone except that the forest has the aforementioned ghost children their voices echo when talking to sharon their father or each other gary kent looks like a filthy george lucas with <UNK> clothes and humanity lost as i mentioned above the violence isn't as grisly as what is suggested because director jones is able to effectively cut away from a great deal of knife <UNK> yet the way he stages the set pieces leave you rather <UNK> such as <UNK> murder the violence mostly <UNK> on the surface of a nearby huge stone <UNK> her <UNK> for john to stop and once stabbed several times attempts to crawl away from her predator only to be finished off a hanging corpse john is <UNK> i've seen better and worse of this type of slasher film it's rather mediocre at best with some effectively shot scenery i don't really think it's particularly memorable for the exception of the ghost children
<START> now i <UNK> onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching in the same way that you watch a car crash br br i appreciate the fact it's a spoof but that should not stop me from <UNK> the god awful directing acting and dialogue seriously this rated as one of the <UNK> movies i have seen it looked more like an episode of tales from the <UNK> and a poor one at that br br okay a few criticisms 1 when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster we never see the monster attack him so we assume its a heart attack the army then launch <UNK> rockets bullets at the monster which was feet from the doctor yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive 2 the army attack from about 100 <UNK> away and we see a flame <UNK> being used <UNK> those things have a range of no more than 30 <UNK> 3 when the monster tries to take the professor the soldiers run into the <UNK> and fire into the ceiling the monster drops the kid and the soldiers don't try to shoot the monster come on 4 the monster looks like it something out of power rangers 5 there is one scene where the five good guys the priest the girl the doctor the reporter and the kid all look shocked and we get reactions along the lines of hand to mouth one after the other so natural 6 the general just runs away time after time 7 the general refuses to try electricity and wouldn't listen 8 the acting is awful 9 did i mention the rubber suit monster 10 that god awful music non stop
<START> from the beginning of the movie i had a feeling like its a movie about another <UNK> from friday the 13th and it is <UNK> that the movie starts interesting but as the times goes by its just a pointless movie about muted supernatural silent serial killer i mean he goes under the guy's bed without making any sound not seen by anyone he was supposed to be blind after failed execution but he walks and kills people like he used to i'm tired of it for me it's all over the same thing br br in another words unreal too many mistakes and confusing information br br well scene with tide up woman looked impressive but just at first time for that and for intriguing intro 2 stars
<START> the acting itself wasn't even that bad since it <UNK> come to mind in the movie but whatever had this director in mind the intended climb towards some climax completely missed the mark br br almost all scenes involve acting that stand so far from our own intentions and way of <UNK> on things that you don't really <UNK> to any actor in the movie br br empty <UNK> in this case see through cheap method of <UNK> your way into potential <UNK> brilliance which just wasn't here at all br br i guess i'm <UNK> but <UNK> 2 hours of my time
<START> in the fifties the age <UNK> for films in brazil were the following no <UNK> 10 years old 14 years old and 18 years old usually the westerns were allowed for ten years old when they had a bit more of violence they would go to 14 but it was rare to see a western <UNK> for younger than 18 winchester 73 was one of those and i think this explains very well how this film was considered different from average the hero james stewart was fighting against his own brother who had killed their father he was looking for revenge and seemed quite traumatized far from the average good guy anthony mann tried variations on this type of character in the next films he did with stewart shelley winters the leading lady was far from <UNK> she kept following the man who stayed with the rifle dan duryea as <UNK> <UNK> dean is one of those great villains that will always be remembered the story of the film which always follows the man who stays with the rifle is one of the best suited for a western it was to be made into a fritz lang film which did not come through when it was offered to mann he made a point of starting from zero again and not taking anything that was prepared for lang with winchester mann created a different conception of western but still maintaining all its traditions winchester still is a great film to see again and again but nothing will be comparable to the impression it made in those who saw it when it was originally released
<START> who made this film i love this film somebody has a wacky sense of humor br br this zany surreal style of film making is appealing but it is hard to create or easy to forget that substance and characters who actually have souls are what give such a film depth without that a comedy is just a bunch of ideas who cares it may get laughs but it goes through you like a half good <UNK> next br br <UNK> may not intend to change <UNK> life but i appreciate the depth and substance they sneak up on you i started this film thinking oh i get it indie comedy off the wall <UNK> <UNK> and it is that but if you pay attention there is sub text and character moments filling it out in this sense the film <UNK> it makes <UNK> that give pause if you're available to see them and then of course it goes on its insanely merry way br br you will miss the point if you don't sign the contract to suspend belief at moments in the film stepping between reality and <UNK> is one of the points of this movie br br <UNK> isn't perfect but smart people made it i want more br br the <UNK> room scenes are an absolute hoot br br put on your seat belt
<START> i searched video store everywhere to find this movie being the huge elvis fan that i am and i found it to be a huge disappointment kurt <UNK> had most of the elvis moves down and the voice imitation was great but the dubbed in singing voice of elvis just didnt work for me the voice didnt always match up with <UNK> mouth and it was hard for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was noticeable also there were so many freaking <UNK> in the film people who dont know much about elvis would probably think them to be facts songs are sung by him earlier than he recorded them in real life the time when he got his first guitar is wrong im pretty sure his brother jesse <UNK> was buried in an <UNK> grave not one with a huge <UNK> reading jesse <UNK> i know it was just a tv movie but they <UNK> over important events like the come back special and dragged some scenes out for way too long if you want to see a good movie that shows elvis in his prime rent thats the way it is or another elvis concert hearing and seeing the real elvis <UNK> is the only way to truly see his talent brilliant statement i know but still go out and rent a good elvis <UNK>
<START> ya know when one looks at this brian <UNK> film today i'm sure there has been <UNK> of criticism about how dated it is also about the violence when i looked at this film on vhs when i was 20 i thought it was <UNK> violent and gritty as well but i didn't get <UNK> br br a few decades go by and man how i know how much i didn't get in this film this is a remake of an excellent film which was done back in the 30's 40's how can you improve upon a classic ya don't but you tell a tale that is brought up to date through the eyes of the new immigrants during the most greed ridden decade the over indulgent 80's <UNK> stone and the gang present an ambitious disturbing and darn right good film br br yes disco was dying and new wave punk were taking over but these immigrants from cuba who had to make a new home in florida couldn't tell the difference it was exciting it was what they wanted but how to get it to these immigrants there was only one way to get it in florida where they were by having lots of money and to get the money you had to take over running a drug empire br br al pacino was fantastic to me as tony montana the little train that could what an amazing way to have your lead character look at america to fight kill steal lie cheat all to get the money the women and the power br br that's what tony saw as the american dream br br he wanted it he wanted to live it and in his circle saw nothing wrong with how he went to get it tony <UNK> command of the english language was heavily <UNK> with the f word but what did you expect emily <UNK> finishing school for him and his co <UNK> look at how they came to america what they knew what they were exposed to this is the way tony and his crew chose to be all they can be in america it was all about the power tony montana would and did anything to achieve it it all its violent lying stealing crooked <UNK> glory br br the part of the film that <UNK> the 1980's to me is the money <UNK> tony's crew bringing <UNK> of drug money to the bank did those around tony and his crew care at the <UNK> where he spent and <UNK> nope money was money and with money you get the power tony was living high off the <UNK> he and his pretty blond american <UNK> he married played well by michelle <UNK> br br after tony <UNK> rise to power he finds out its really crappy up there he's <UNK> with doubt he's drug addicted he's paranoid he's surrounded by those who want to take him on in a bloody take over his <UNK> 80's american blonde drug addicted wife he finds out is a bore he needs to keep <UNK> of his empire because he's going down and down he goes in a horrific violent fashion but again i ask what do you expect br br this is the quintessential 1980's film telling you a <UNK> tale of how some <UNK> the american dream to obsession it's violent bloody overly so but it drives the point <UNK> home not all <UNK> thrown out of cuba who landed in florida in the 80's were anything like tony montana give me a break but the showing of how miserable the 1980's were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only <UNK> in the usa to be somebody and have power took its tool on these poor characters and their lives in america br br makes you wonder has anything from then been learned today
<START> this 1973 remake of the classic 1944 billy wilder film double <UNK> is a <UNK> example of how to destroy a great script this grade b tv fodder also illustrates the <UNK> of remakes in general while hollywood has gone after greedy executives that <UNK> black and white films and sought <UNK> on wide screen movies that are shown in pan and <UNK> versions the industry has ignored the <UNK> that insist on taking a classic film and <UNK> it with a shoddy remake br br the first step in producing a <UNK> version of a classic is to edit the script the billy wilder raymond chandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a <UNK> time <UNK> with room for commercials then update the production with bland color photography smart <UNK> sets and tv familiar actors thus the brand new double <UNK> <UNK> the atmospheric black and white film noir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original gone are the dusty shadowy claustrophobic sets that explained the <UNK> desires to escape their situations at whatever cost gone are the close bond between <UNK> and <UNK> and the erotic attraction between <UNK> and <UNK> br br the look of jack <UNK> take on double <UNK> is more <UNK> than film noir <UNK> <UNK> has a designer home to die for and <UNK> <UNK> pad would be hard to afford on an insurance <UNK> <UNK> not to mention the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that he drives neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a <UNK> 200 000 if not money then perhaps murder for love or lust not in this version richard crenna shows little interest in samantha <UNK> and their kisses are about as <UNK> as those between a brother and a sister crenna fails to capture the cynicism of <UNK> and his attempts at double <UNK> and sexual <UNK> fall horribly flat <UNK> is little better and lacks <UNK> and the depth to suggest the inner <UNK> of a supposedly <UNK> and manipulative mind only lee j <UNK> manages a <UNK> performance as <UNK> director jack <UNK> and his three principals have all done much better work br br there was no <UNK> reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule there was no <UNK> reason to <UNK> this dud on dvd and package it with the original film except to fill out a double disc package the only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting lackluster direction and tv grade production values the 1973 double <UNK> should be titled 10 <UNK> because viewing it only <UNK> the 100 perfection of the original movie
<START> i imagine when hitchcock <UNK> and experts find themselves together the talk is not of the <UNK> great films like north by <UNK> or strangers on a train but a lesser known effort like this one from 1931 obscure and seriously flawed which showcases the great director in <UNK> form br br emily and fred hill joan barry and harry <UNK> are a middle class london couple <UNK> to stay ahead he <UNK> their lot she accepts it change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of <UNK> luxury they make plans for a world cruise but their problems have only begun br br just ask richard <UNK> roger o <UNK> or marion <UNK> well <UNK> <UNK> at the moment but you get the idea travel and hitchcock go together like <UNK> and <UNK> setting one up for a <UNK> journey at best this is perhaps hitchcock's earliest <UNK> into this theme and not his most successful or memorable hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element in this case domestic drama rather than suspense but the two do not <UNK> at least not here br br the hills are a dull flat couple with no chemistry or personality when they find themselves at the <UNK> <UNK> in the form of cross cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film they are <UNK> at the outfits of the female performers the <UNK> gone up too soon <UNK> emily they aren't dressed br br when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing even if the people they partner off with are <UNK> too <UNK> man gordon <UNK> <UNK> carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty <UNK> which he suggests be filled by emily <UNK> girl the princess betty <UNK> has clara <UNK> eyes and wallace <UNK> five <UNK> shadow there's also an obnoxious fellow passenger a <UNK> <UNK> whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue subtlety was still to come br br everything is shot in an abrupt manner with confusing <UNK> and strained dialogue hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his <UNK> that doesn't come off and <UNK> seems to aim for laughs while <UNK> plays for tears when fred and emily break off they are seen being <UNK> on a pair of <UNK> together <UNK> one of many clunky attempts at symbolism br br <UNK> the only vaguely sympathetic character in part because she really cares about her husband and <UNK> over her affair with gordon but mostly because she's among the first of hitchcock's many <UNK> <UNK> her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> around her face like a <UNK> aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film's conclusion br br matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set piece for the protagonists to come to grips with and presumably <UNK> their relationship only they aren't active participants in the resolution and except for the fate of a friendly cat nothing about the ending <UNK> br br at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early 1930s and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food rich and strange is hitchcock paying his <UNK> and learning his trade one for <UNK> but not casual film goers
<START> <UNK> people say that <UNK> is better <UNK> is a good film but i enjoyed bug's life a bit more i can't remember a pixar animation other than the two toy story films that i was laughing so hard the animation is clean the story is original and doesn't <UNK> the voice overs are what make this movie dave <UNK> is an earnest <UNK> that gets himself into trouble a lot hopper is a superb characterisation by the always wonderful kevin spacey as is <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> there is also sterling support from dennis <UNK> david hyde pierce and <UNK> <UNK> and i could go on and on the script is fantastic so funny and sometimes even touching it lacks the social messages of <UNK> but what we have is rock solid entertainment 9 10 <UNK> cox
<START> i don't think you can get much worse then this put together bad actors fake limbs and three stupid stories and what do you get this b rate pointless excuse for a movie br br the first story immediately shows the bad video quality and the acting is just really pathetic especially when you bring in the 25 year old posing as a grandma with the usually grandma <UNK> over the ears bit plus the man is ok but the woman is rather ugly you look great not the werewolf in this one was the best one out of all three i'd say but its still not impressive since it was all bad costume the face on the woman later was decent enough for halloween but not for a werewolf movie br br the more stories you go through the worse it gets there are two lesbians in this next one who are completely retarded its ridiculous the whole i want to be a werewolf too how could you do this to me was silly to say you asked for it now get over it the werewolf will not even be spoken of its a rat br br the third one has no point almost forty five minutes of running and boring narration make up this story and the whole switch thing still didn't make it interesting boring br br music yes bad who couldn't even hear some parts it was stupid animals effects were either rat or pig like which was stupid they couldn't use lion sounds guess not good movies use that well i f you enjoy b rates this is good for you i got this movie since i'm a hardcore werewolf fan and i'll buy any werewolf movie and watch it more then once but thats just me if you prefer good ones don't waste your money i beg you
<START> i gave this movie a 10 because it needed to be rewarded for its scary elements and actors and my god the <UNK> the thing is i don't want to tell anyone anything about the acting or story because it will ruin the movie but i will recommend that you go straight to your nearest <UNK> right now and rent it don't forget popcorn
<START> marvelous james stewart vera miles vehicle what makes this historical film dealing with the fbi so good is the family element that is involved during a 35 year career as depicted by stewart in the film br br the film shows a history of the great <UNK> agency it deals with airplane bomb plots killing off of indians in <UNK> for real estate gain fighting organized crime nazis and <UNK> in that order the human element is never far behind as stewart <UNK> vera miles they raise 3 children as <UNK> heart goes out each time stewart goes out on assignment br br look for a brief but memorable performance by murray hamilton years later he appeared as mr robinson in <UNK> the graduate br br the film has nothing but praise for j edgar hoover he certainly brought the fbi up to par br br true this could be viewed as right wing propaganda especially with stewart's real life <UNK> views but it's well done historically informative and the view of the family so well depicted
<START> marie you are smooth dan no i'm not smooth i'm dan br br if you're anything like me smooth and single do not go together you see someone you like rare enough as that can be and you want to say something but you don't or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you've ever said in your life more often then not though you stare from <UNK> and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life  a risk you can't blame a guy for being a little frightened though maybe he's been burned hard before or maybe he's trying to focus all his energy on his career there are reasons some valid some not and all of them can be interpreted as excuses rather than reason you tell yourself you don't need it or it isn't the right time for you but you still wish it were happening any way you break it down it's not easy sound familiar if you thought yes even just a little then dan in real life the new comedy from director peter <UNK> is a must see it will reach inside of you and somehow manage to both break and warm your heart all at once br br the dan from the title is dan burns steve carell an advice <UNK> who is admired for his insight into living a balanced fulfilling and morally uplifting life four years or so before the film opens on dan waking up to his day he lost his wife and love of his life after that tragedy dan was left to raise their three daughters alone between that and focusing on his career finding love again was not one of <UNK> <UNK> and so he became more <UNK> than feeling removed from the power of <UNK> dan no longer knows what it means to be that close to someone and has <UNK> himself to never knowing that again that is until he meets marie juliette <UNK> in a book and tackle shop in <UNK> on a quiet morning they're interaction is casual comfortable and it catches both of them off guard there is only one problem really she is already seeing someone unfortunately for all involved that someone is <UNK> brother mitch <UNK> cook his entire family has come up to their parents' country home for their <UNK> visit and dan must now spend the weekend <UNK> and yearning for the fleeting feeling he had with marie that morning it only lasted an hour or so but it only took that long to <UNK> <UNK> heart from its coma br br with so many family members to deal with jack <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are at the <UNK> dan in real life does drift away from its <UNK> purpose from time to time while the <UNK> of kids and parents and aunts and <UNK> makes for trying times for dan <UNK> also uses it unnecessarily as a means to distract with the <UNK> that it would ultimately make for a more complete film luckily <UNK> has got carell to carry the heavy burden it is a pleasure to watch steve carell come into his own more and more with every picture he makes despite the occasional <UNK> almighty sized <UNK> he is charismatic charming and obviously a sharp <UNK> as dan he is also self <UNK> awkward and scared carell is the rare comedian who pushes himself to find character in his roles rather than rely solely on his comedic instincts and established persona perhaps more importantly he is entirely <UNK> as dan whether he's <UNK> down on the <UNK> in the <UNK> room where he is subjected to sleep as the only single adult at this reunion or <UNK> around the kitchen unable to stan d still in his anxiety dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd carell gives dan so much heart that he becomes the heart of the film itself at the same time br br i wondered after seeing the film if i enjoyed the it as much as i did despite its slight shortcomings juliette <UNK>  i know you might like to <UNK> up every now and then but i don't recommend it unless there is chocolate involved because of where i am in my life would someone who has found that someone else <UNK> as much meaning and comfort from this film i can't say what i can say as someone who knows what it means to be lonely dan in real life knows what it means to be surprised by life and love and how these moments and people need to be appreciated and <UNK> it also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen
<START> i will spend a few days dedicated to ron howard before i swear off his work entirely having unfortunately dealt with lucas at such a young age howard is now caught up in so many of <UNK> traits how else do you explain his rampage of disasters his only useful film of course has been <UNK> everything else including this is too <UNK> on superficial junk br br some spoilers br br he can't even have semi intelligent focus like peter <UNK> no poor howard so stuck on his <UNK> <UNK> qualities that he will be quickly forgotten br br here we have the old <UNK> love <UNK> all even disease too bad for howard that lynch already got through the whole subtext with more skill heck even disney did better than this ron even goofs up on the possibilities presented by imagined realities br br <UNK> commentary track is just awful don't even rent the dvd br br final analysis cinematic dud
<START> although nothing can compare to vampires vs zombies in any realm of film making i will attempt to judge this movie br br firstly the special effects were breath taking when there was an explosion on the television screen i thought my entire house was going to explode and when automatic machine guns were fired i thought the <UNK> were landing on the floor right next to me simply stunning my friends br br but the scene when the jack black sound a like is giving the worst monologue i have ever heard i nearly killed myself but don't worry since he was getting <UNK> in the movie he can pass his awful acting off on i must be high seriously he must have watched himself <UNK> <UNK> about non <UNK> thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be high to justify his awful acting well if you can say that to excuse terrible acting then if you talked to the writers directors executive producers <UNK> you will probably get the same response seriously br br with a production team called shock o <UNK> i was shocked i didn't place a <UNK> off shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this shockingly terrible excuse for a movie was played br br if you want to see this movie then you should be murdered br br yours truly br br the general
<START> i couldn't not recommend a christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel trust me double <UNK> are required here it's that bad this film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the <UNK> the musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good thank you very much has a decent melody but the lyrics are stupid beyond words i would gladly bear the chains worn by scrooge in the film's bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals again br br the only entertaining part of this movie completely unintentional by the way involves alec guinness as <UNK> <UNK> dressed in a silly <UNK> white costume guinness <UNK> <UNK> through his scenes in what was either an attempt to make it appear as though he was floating like a ghost or to show his utter disdain with having to be in this dreadful movie albert finney meanwhile <UNK> the best of <UNK> <UNK> and charles <UNK> to create his hopelessly <UNK> character of <UNK> scrooge <UNK> scrooge is so hideous a person it's impossible to believe his transformation br br steer clear of this abomination of filmmaking at all costs
<START> the words swedish and action movie do not mix that becomes more and more obvious with every attempt made in the genre this is yet another failed attempt br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> works at a military air base with top secret computer systems one day foreign criminals <UNK> to hurt his family if he doesn't do what they tell him they want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it br br this movie has it's ups and downs and usually in swedish action movies there are no ups just downs so i guess something in this movie showed some quality to begin with the positive remarks i can mention that the movie is technically well made the footage of planes and <UNK> flying are well shot and look very nice the acting is of very varying quality <UNK> <UNK> makes a decent performance while maria <UNK> is stiff and unnatural as usual i wonder how long swedish directors are going to keep using her even though she has the acting skills of a wooden <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is laughable as the cool special forces man who comes to the base to investigate br br and what about the action scenes well as i said above the scenes of planes and <UNK> flying are nice but aside from that there is not much action to talk about and that is a common problem with swedish action films there is just not enough action going on maybe it's a budget problem maybe it's film making culture i don't know but it <UNK> affects the experience because quite frankly the story and acting is not good enough for this movie to rely just on that br br i rate this 4 10 for effort
<START> the main problem of the first vampires movie is that none of the characters were sympathetic carpenter learned from his mistake and this time used a likable vampire hunter and a charismatic vampire the female vampire <UNK> certainly is the coolest vampire since <UNK> <UNK> frost unfortunately while there are some good concepts like a cool slow motion restaurant scene why didn't carpenter use more of this this movie is nowhere near as good as it could have been i expected to see strong vampires in action and at least one longer lasting nicely choreographed fight sequence for example inside a city and was left somewhat disappointed while los <UNK> proceeds at a faster pace than its predecessor it still drags a little in some parts though nowhere near as bad as vampires did much like vampires however this movie's climax near the end is not very intense br br most of the above may sound like los <UNK> is a bad movie but it definitely isn't it is generally enjoyable and ranks among the better entries to the genre it is neither an unoriginal dracula remake like almost every other vampire movie out there nor is it an <UNK> action spectacle like blade ii it simply could have used a bit more excitement br br i'd really like to see a third installment made by carpenter but it's probably not going to happen br br spoiler warning the ending was way too predictable <UNK> should have gotten away that would have made the movie quite unusual
<START> i've only watched the first series on dvd but would <UNK> the sopranos as a shakespearean plot with a tarantino like script the series is as good as <UNK> and casino and almost as good as the godfather hence not a 10 and far better than any of guy <UNK> efforts although there's plenty of action some of it pretty bloody the story is character driven even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines e g the <UNK> relationship or lack of with <UNK> and the <UNK> wife and christopher and his <UNK> friend who didn't last very long a <UNK> award <UNK> br br apart from the plot the script and the acting the other reasons i liked it br br 1 it made me want to visit new jersey and eat <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> 2 the music 3 it shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems
<START> i first saw this movie in the theater when i was 8 years old and it still cracks me up the muppets are so cool and they approach show business in a <UNK> naive way my favorite scene is when the rats start a <UNK> campaign on behalf of <UNK> at a fancy restaurant this is one smart and funny movie for kids and parents alike long live <UNK> miss <UNK> and the rest of the gang
<START> i come to <UNK> from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who have posted here i'm relatively new to bollywood films and was born and raised in the us so i don't have a broad basis for comparing <UNK> to other indian films luckily no comparison is needed br br <UNK> stands on its own as nothing less than a masterpiece br br in one line i can tell you that <UNK> is one of the most important films to come out of any studio anywhere at any time on a mass appeal scale it could have been the indian equivalent of <UNK> tiger hidden dragon had it been adequately promoted in the us this could very well have been the film that put bollywood on the american map the american movie going public has a long standing love affair with gone with the wind and while <UNK> doesn't borrow from that plot there are some passing similarities not the least of which is the <UNK> by us standards <UNK> minute run time br br set against the gritty backdrop of the india <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> 48 is a compelling human drama of a young woman imprisoned by circumstances and thrust into troubles she had no hand in creating put into an <UNK> position she somehow manages to not only survive but to grow and even <UNK> br br if the story is lacking in any way it's in the exposition <UNK> the protagonist growth as a person would be better illustrated at least for western audiences unfamiliar with indian culture if her character's back story were more fully developed in the early part of the film but that would have stretched a 3 hour movie to 3 1 2 hours or perhaps even more because not one minute of the film is wasted and none of what made it out of editing could really be cut for the sake of time better that the audience has to fill in some of what came before than to leave out any of what remains br br i could use many words to describe <UNK> poignant disturbing compelling heart wrenching come to mind immediately but uplifting is perhaps as <UNK> as any of those any story that points up the <UNK> of the human spirit against the worst of odds has to be considered such and <UNK> triumph while possibly not immediately evident to those around her is no less than inspirational for strength of story alone i cannot recommend this film highly enough br br equally inspiring is <UNK> <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> all too often overlooked amid the <UNK> of younger newer actresses <UNK> has the unique <UNK> to deliver a completely credible character in any role she plays she doesn't merely act <UNK> part she <UNK> life into the character <UNK> <UNK> selection as <UNK> was inspired he manages something far too few indian film heroes can subtlety his command of expression and nuance is essential to the role he brings more menace to the early part of the film with his <UNK> stare than all of the sword wielding <UNK> combined br br if you only see one bollywood film in your life make it <UNK>
<START> this movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite not that i expect a great deal of <UNK> in movies but you'd think that even the homeless and urban <UNK> jack mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide and upon reaching the hunting grounds poor ice t plays his part as if he is actually going to lead these men through woods he's never seen before br br and how does jack mason find thomas burns back in seattle br br i'm assuming this movie was based on richard <UNK> short story the most dangerous game a few years ago i showed this movie to a class of <UNK> grade students after they read the story i <UNK> the movie cutting out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity it ended up being <UNK> minutes long
<START> the film cross eyed by adam jones <UNK> the viewer on a ride of redemption as the main character takes back control of the wheel and sets his life in order adam jones has found an imaginative and refreshing way to <UNK> his character and <UNK> what matters most these truths become apparent to both the characters and viewers as you laugh and gag to the credits with them the simple yet attractive settings costumes keep you guessing about what you will see next you can't help but smile and laugh at the antics that take place in this movie i can't wait for his <UNK> effort it is only a matter of time before jones strikes again bravo
<START> i think that this film is brilliant there are many reasons why but these are some of them 1 the good acting by tom and tyler 2 brilliant machine gun scene that was a piece of brilliance 3 i thought that the ending was a good twist because i never expected that at the end all credit to sam <UNK> as well as a these 3 points the film form of the film is good as well i am a film student at college and we studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films i have seen in many years i'd just like to say a big thank you to all of the people involved in making this film lastly i would like to say the best scene in the film is the machine gun scene where john rooney gets kill it is just pure brilliance in shooting the scene in silence until john rooney says i'm glad it's you it is a lot better like that i think because the viewer creates there own sound and that sound is totally different for every viewer just brilliant br br thank you for reading this comment written by ross kirk aged 16
<START> cry freedom is not just a movie it is a historical account heroic story and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history not only does denzel washington do a terrific job of <UNK> a <UNK> determined hero steve biko but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of south <UNK> apartheid the story of biko an influential leader and his main <UNK> donald woods is a heartbreaking one but the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in south africa cry freedom manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot it is because of great films like this one that the public can become educated on terrible events in history great leaders who sought to end them and how we can never allow them to happen in the future because of this importance cry freedom is an amazing film that should be seen by all
<START> i find it hard to believe that anyone would put this movie in the same context as the exorcist where the exorcist was subtle and creepy <UNK> was blunt clumsy and way too formulaic br br this is one of the most visually beautiful films i've seen in a while but the imagery does not make up for the <UNK> spiral of <UNK> exposition that makes it unbearable br br my interest in this movie was <UNK> when it was compared to the exorcist and my visit to the official web site <UNK> that interest the web site had many tales of actual <UNK> throughout history however scene by scene the movie is so obsessed by its quest for <UNK> that it becomes comical at first then outright hard to watch toward the end i began getting suspicious when the priest charged with investigating potential <UNK> walks into the beauty <UNK> where our would be heroine cuts hair and evidently <UNK> with priests br br the plot a woman without faith in god begins receiving the wounds of christ the <UNK> and is <UNK> and upset about the ordeal a priest is sent straight from the <UNK> to investigate the case is frankie possessed by satan or a <UNK> for jesus christ br br the only miracle in this film is that it finally ends
<START> the widower family man dan burns steve carell writes the <UNK> dan in real life giving <UNK> for families in the new jersey standard and raises his three daughters alone jane allison <UNK> the older has just got her driving license but dan does not allow her to drive <UNK> <UNK> robertson has a crush on his high school mate marty and the young lily marlene <UNK> misses her mother when dan and his daughters travel to <UNK> island for a family reunion he meets marie juliette <UNK> in a <UNK> and they spend hours talking to each other they feel attracted for each other but marie receives a phone call and leaves dan giving her phone number first dan immediately falls in love for marie but when he return to his <UNK> home he finds that marie is the girlfriend of his wolf brother mitch burns <UNK> cook who is also in love with her along the weekend the attraction between the clumsy dan and marie <UNK> and they have to take a decision br br dan in real life is a great surprise and a delightful movie with comedy romance and drama the chemistry of the gorgeous juliette <UNK> and steve carell is awesome and it is very easy to know why everybody loves marie the trio allison <UNK> <UNK> robertson and marlene <UNK> is fantastic and their characters are responsible for some of the best moments of this story the screenplay is wonderful and the performances of the talented actors and actresses are stunning with a realistic behavior of a family meeting follow the advice of <UNK> <UNK> and plan to be surprised with the reunion of the <UNK> family my vote is eight br br title brazil <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> e <UNK> <UNK> me my brother and our girlfriend
<START> time for hollywood to sit up and take notice if the actors are acting <UNK> all you need to do is get the animators who worked on this little marvel renaissance is probably the first animation flick which makes you forget that you are not seeing human beings although the voice overs by the cast craig <UNK> <UNK> etc are some of the best i have ever heard but even then the emotions portrayed by the <UNK> are unnerving br br this style of animation is not very new but the use of light and shadows makes the movie a living painting ironically such technical <UNK> makes you forget that this is actually a very very nice movie the pacing and plot development are marvelous and the dialogs crisp br br plot disappearance of a mega <UNK> top employee <UNK> a tale of <UNK> and corruption with a cold hearted hero at the <UNK> can't say much without giving it all away except that while the movie keeps you at the edge of your seat the climax leaves you speechless br br a must watch even for the <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> at <UNK>
<START> what's in here let me tell you it's the presence of alec baldwin he's not a great actor but maybe a nice star with some good movies which this is not one of them he did nothing here more than anything he did before or after so not to mention literally the matter of steve mcqueen being at the same role in the original because i don't want to make that comparison in the first place i'm not a big fan or even a fan of kim basinger she got a lot of bad movies on her and even at her best she looks average and it gets on my nerve indeed whenever they talk about her seductive rare beauty well if being a blond would make anyone captivating then i'll <UNK> my hair in yellow as soon as possible and what is it with all the <UNK> over miss <UNK> legs it's surely insanity or bad <UNK> as i don't see them both as not sexy only but ugly too and if you hate that so shoot me down but you know what i've just watched this movie so i'm dead already yet what would make you really suffer in unbearable way is that nothing of the credits goes to the one she deserves the <UNK> of course i mean jennifer <UNK> now we're talking about a true genuine seductive chick with such unforgettable body and one unique sense of <UNK> like a nasty brunette marilyn monroe however much more <UNK> i can't help it she was the only new and watchable thing in here michael madsen as the bad guy was much appealing as well as effective more than the good guys james woods is here to <UNK> the early events beside the pool so the trailer would be by his voice later and he knew before all that this is a whole hollywood's stuff so do your thing take your cash and good luck as an actor in other movies the editing gave the movie a serious personality along with violent atmosphere done by suitable shining cinematography so the main goods of it the action the thrill are here and fairly well made though any echo for deep meanings about the kinds of betrayal as the main dramatic <UNK> of the whole thing is not that strong so don't wait for it ok it's all in all another remake without anything special except jennifer <UNK> <UNK> moments so i think i tried to be objective as much as i could therefore i shouldn't end my review saying that basinger or anyone here did better than this movie it would be an insult because frankly anything is better than this movie
<START> this movie is a lot better than the <UNK> version mainly its war of the worlds the <UNK> look pretty cool but their walking and deaths could have been better the action scenes were really cool walking walking walking walking oh my god stop walking please or i'm going to kill myself the thunder child scene was my favorite sequence mainly because a ship <UNK> bunch of <UNK> good movie i recommend it for people ho have read the book the music is awesome and the directors cut looks pretty cool br br pros good soundtrack 99 to the book cool violence <UNK> and handling machines are cool to look at br br cons some bad acting cheesy looking london
<START> <UNK> only in the 70's antonio <UNK> brings us this quirky hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu flick <UNK> around a treasure hunt the <UNK> of this trashy co production between shaw brothers and an italian one off company include humorous storytelling off the wall happenings and some very tame t a extra campy moments are being served by lee van <UNK> obnoxious wig leather clad bible <UNK> psycho <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> up by julian <UNK> the man who should've done way more obscure european genre productions than he did wanna be witty dialogue hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effects accompanying various little events especially every jump made by lo <UNK> br br while this little piece of action falls fare and square into the turkey territory it's great to see van <UNK> and lo <UNK> on the same screen and you can't deny the charisma of this duo don't expect too much and you'll get plenty out of it br br this is my truth what is yours
<START> i have been using imdb for years and i never wanted to get involved in the commentary of <UNK> now this documentary has so many problems that i hardly know what to say i am not a muslim nor am i an <UNK> studies expert but i know enough to shed some light on the obvious one sided viewpoint that this documentary <UNK> br br the problems with this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary most of the documentaries that i have seen anchor themselves around a few valid points and then surround those points with <UNK> interpretations and <UNK> this is certainly the case with islam what the west needs to know yes there are <UNK> around the world and some of them are muslim but to build a documentary about all of islam around a small <UNK> of <UNK> people is incredibly misleading this is really a documentary about the <UNK> aspects of islam and nothing more br br for those who would like to more <UNK> explore some of the issues raised in this documentary here are several points that may help br br there was nothing positive about islam presented in the documentary br br the documentary focuses on the middle east but more muslims live outside of that region more muslims live in china believe it or not than in <UNK> <UNK> about 40 of all muslims live in <UNK> <UNK> india and <UNK> br br the translation of the <UNK> used in the documentary is a questionable one i watched the documentary while viewing another translation and the differences were striking i had been warned about the translation that was used in the documentary and now i know why <UNK> 98 6 is a good example the documentary suggests that the <UNK> says that <UNK> will go to hell but the translation i have reads instead those who reject truth among the people of the book and among the <UNK> will be in <UNK> the difference is that those who reject truth are those people who know about god and the truth of god and decide to reject it anyways br br the movie mentioned that there is no morality inherent in islam but this is not true although it is true that much comes from the <UNK> and <UNK> islam also <UNK> a concept called <UNK> or <UNK> behavior obviously what is <UNK> can be interpreted many ways but <UNK> is meant to be good behavior what an average person would consider right or wrong br br the documentary presents <UNK> <UNK> law as being one <UNK> body of knowledge that all muslims follow this is simply not true there are many <UNK> schools of law and they range from <UNK> and <UNK> to <UNK> in the way they interpret law br br the <UNK> tradition is similar there are thousands of <UNK> and each school of law accepts some and rejects others using the <UNK> without serious <UNK> to determine which ones are accurate real and <UNK> is <UNK> picking and choosing <UNK> from history that fit what you want to <UNK> which is what the documentary did br br what i hope people realize is that <UNK> is the problem not islam or any other religion christianity has <UNK> that shoot abortion clinic doctors and so on i know this is not the same as suicide bombing just understand that the <UNK> of <UNK> is arguably the problem if you feel you have the answer then everyone else must be wrong but if you feel you have an answer you can work together with other people's views about politics religion god or whatever
<START> the reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point it's obvious he hasn't been young or innocent in a very long time or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the well meaning young characters actually thought they could make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace if only it was that easy but the <UNK> sit and <UNK> at people who <UNK> try their best to make things better as the situation gets worse and worse every single day well if you're not part of the solution you're part of the problem br br the central theme is that revenge <UNK> more revenge which <UNK> even more in an ever <UNK> bloodbath both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side which they think justify their committing even more in <UNK> where does it end and apparently he missed the significance of the bubble referred to in the name which was that people living in tel <UNK> are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them which is partly why they seemed so naive he also seemed to think that <UNK> could slip through the <UNK> without a problem which tells me he wasn't paying attention when <UNK> related the <UNK> and problems he had encountered br br i found it very brave of the director the screenplay writer and both star crossed lovers to update the romeo juliet story to a modern troubled land and to make both lovers male let's be honest here very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female young love wins all hearts but when people's <UNK> with their sexuality is added to the fact that incredibly these same people would rather have them hate each other then the conclusion is inevitable
<START> ah <UNK> made another gangster film with <UNK> thought the average fan expecting another snatch lock stock expecting perhaps a couple of <UNK> shifts but none too hard for me and the <UNK> to swallow after a few beers br br ah pay attention you do need to watch this film no <UNK> of tea no extra <UNK> <UNK> from the counter no keep it running shouts as you <UNK> to the <UNK> watch the film no laughs other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence and if that <UNK> your boat so be it but sharp solid direction excellent dialogue and great performances br br my favourite big <UNK> from the sopranos always a reliable hood
<START> i anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly cliché but i was completely wrong charlie cox i had never heard of him until now played an incredibly good leading man he was so earnest and romantic me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him br br claire danes who i did like before loved her in romeo and juliet made me enjoy her even more her acting was fantastic i couldn't even tell that she was american the chemistry between her and charlie cox was extremely good the casting was quite perfect br br robert deniro and michelle pfeiffer were equally well casted deniro as that gay pirate priceless priceless i laughed so hard at that one scene where <UNK> comes on the ship oh my god wow pfeiffer played a decent villain i liked her as the <UNK> mother in <UNK> but she had the right amount of melodrama and <UNK> comments throughout the movie br br overall it was funny but not slap stick at all romantic the special effects weren't totally frequent but when they were they were great the cameos from ricky <UNK> and peter o'toole were also well placed br br i totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the princess bride or even lord of the rings it kept my interest the entire time and i will be buying the dvd when it comes out
<START> nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci fi movie that's been <UNK> at the us box office and <UNK> criticized as the <UNK> movie of kurt <UNK> career br br i have my reasons br br firstly when you read negative reviews of this film they usually start with the wooden nature of <UNK> interpretation of todd the eponymous soldier i'm going to start here too with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting i've seen russell pull off todd is an emotional <UNK> and suffering from intense <UNK> this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now br br the portrayal is spot on todd is <UNK> <UNK> and a loner he suffers from irrational anxiety <UNK> to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger his hyper focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger <UNK> that the tasks he is given to do sit within there is a scene where he cuts himself <UNK> <UNK> and continues to work <UNK> not cleaning up the cut or the blood many interpret this as a sign of his physical <UNK> and focus on the job at hand but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the <UNK> task by <UNK> not <UNK> the relationship between the <UNK> he's preparing and the food that will be eaten later br br <UNK> dialog is <UNK> to say the least the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both <UNK> the bleak nature of his existence fear and discipline we are told always fear to keep him <UNK> up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by keeping him ready to react on a knife edge discipline to hold him in check through his fear to overcome it and perform <UNK> the <UNK> is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from <UNK> sandra but i believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who's only experience of an embrace is in combat the <UNK> represents him <UNK> his fight flight instincts <UNK> to the fear of being <UNK> his movement and vision <UNK> fear and discipline indeed br br then there is the subtext of his <UNK> twice in fact so representative of the way our society tends to toss <UNK> onto the rubbish heap of society when they've served their terms 40 of the unemployed are ex military in our world in his it can only be worse russell quickly picks up the <UNK> of <UNK> responsibility to his wife and child desperately in need of a mission even one with such a high <UNK> of his death br br then there is the military subtext too the conflict between <UNK> church and the <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> new men are faster stronger more accurate and aggressive any one of them could pound todd into the ground but it's not about the tools you have it's how you use them an <UNK> todd given the freedom to exercise his <UNK> and acting without the numbing effect of perceived <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tactics and <UNK> tricks to cut a <UNK> through the newer unit sent in without support cover or <UNK> it is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in <UNK> br br there are many other subtle themes when a film is shot and scripted so <UNK> it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root watch soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches you
<START> with title like this you know you get pretty much lot of junk acting bad script bad director bad <UNK> bad br br movie make lot of noise that really not music and lot of people yell movie make bad racial stereotype why come every movie with black hero have drug addict why come hero always have to dance to be success why come famous <UNK> always have to be in dance movie why come letter s can't be in title br br hollywood need to stop dumb down audience and make movie that have people with brain who know how speak proper english br br do self favor and not go see
<START> like talk radio the booth is actually kinda predictable talk radio because we know the truth of what happened going in the booth because of let's face it the genre and the basic set up that's not necessarily a bad thing in this case it means in essence that the filmmakers don't punk out in the end the way they <UNK> in say an american version of this story the booth moves <UNK> toward its <UNK> conclusion but is so beautifully crafted on every level that one can enjoy the ride the way one might a familiar cruise along a well <UNK> stretch of very <UNK> road it reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> spooky short story flop sweat the <UNK> is at times almost <UNK> worth a nice long look
<START> an <UNK> nightmare was an incredibly interesting well made film i loved the way it just throws you into the main character's <UNK> without <UNK> the viewer the acting was top notch honestly i would watch dominic <UNK> read the phone book but everyone else especially the young girl was great as well i was very impressed by the look of the film too usually independent films have a grainy i shot this on my camcorder look to them but this director knows what she's doing the lighting the cinematography quality work i'm looking forward to a feature length work from tess <UNK>
<START> this work is striking in its accurate depiction of teenage life at the time of its execution though this is a broad <UNK> parents of that time were too self absorbed to be real parents and those who were home tended to be far too distracted from the real issues where their children were concerned br br this film teaches us how to let go even when it is painful and does so with a sweet melancholy but informed style <UNK> foster talks <UNK> about feeling the pain of life i loved that scene it was my favorite scene in the movie actually br br the transition from funeral to wedding was meant to show that life does go on and so must we <UNK> <UNK> through a pack of <UNK> and <UNK> them was meant to show us that the troubled times will pass and we are meant to get through them to better times br br the whole metaphor of moving on and the <UNK> of life is present throughout the film and serves to give us hope in the end br br i like this movie though i do not watch it often as it tends to make me melancholy br br it shouldn't be viewed by young children and probably only those raised in the 1970's 80's would want to br br it rates a 7 4 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i can't believe i wasted my time with this movie i couldn't even call it a movie it was so bad with nothing to recommend it br br i like low budget movies and weird flicks but this one had me bored to death badly made and bad acting ruined it from being curious you have to wonder what these people were thinking when they spent money to produce this movie i wonder what i was thinking watching it to the end i recommend this movie to no one how did they release this was there an audience who likes this kind of movie there must be because you can find this at almost any video store but why br br deserves to be forgotten br br if you like bad movies then this is for you
<START> i keep watching this movie over and over and over i have to watch it at least once a week i am from africa and looking at that movie taught me some things that i didn't even know about africa <UNK> movies are all full of lessons for people of walks of life i wish he was my own brother i have also seen and love your <UNK> <UNK> what a thrilling situation when denzel was trying to hook his brother up on the job reminds me of my teen ages when my brother was always mad with me about getting myself busy all the time my brother was always caring for my old father and he wants to see me the same way too by the way where did denzel get that african accent from in the cry freedom movie i have first seen that movie in africa and i didn't know then that denzel was american till i moved down here
<START> ernest <UNK> was so wasted in this movie there was no point in putting this great actor in this movie one of the greatest actors in the world wasted and for what reason none what so ever so america if you want to put classic actors in movies don't waste them
<START> by now you should already know about this film the jessica simpson bomb that pretty much went straight to video limited <UNK> theatrical run basically ms <UNK> katie travels from a small town in <UNK> to visit her boyfriend to surprise him only to find him in bed with another woman she is stranded but has one friend rachel leigh cook whom i wish we saw more often in film who lets her stay katie ends up getting a job via two conniving co workers penelope ann miller and the always amusing andy dick who are just using katie to get the president of the firm larry miller <UNK> this is strictly a b movie its not meant to be profound jessica simpson is not a great actress by any means but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying the film is watchable in that its not an abomination but its throwaway fluff in a cameo penny marshall is funny a subtle in joke about <UNK> made me chuckle and there is a funny scene involving norwegian priests don't read too much into this so not horrible but easy to skip your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does again not good but not a profound disaster
<START> bruce almighty one of <UNK> best pictures since well a long time it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too morgan freeman plays god well and even <UNK> in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes the best scene in it is where jim is messing up the anchor man's voice br br my rating 8 10
<START> everyone in this movie tells <UNK> <UNK> how talented she is what a great director she'll one day turn out to be etc i think they're just being nice even <UNK> <UNK> who directed this film shows more talent than she does the next jane <UNK> they call her and even apart from the fact that they're both over rated the two have so much in common they both direct movies they're both women they're both australian well give or take br br yep it's one of those films in which a character is deemed to be brilliant and we just have to swallow hard and accept it but i'll say this for <UNK> she's cute and fascinating no really here are some thoughts on her lack of talent br br 1 part of a director's talent lies in dealing with people why is <UNK> so <UNK> bad at getting her crew to even take notice of her so as to make it easier for everyone to wander off the set and get killed i expect br br 2 why is this one of the most unconvincing depictions of a movie set i have ever seen after all it must have been filmed on a real movie set how could they get it wrong if <UNK> set was half as much of an under <UNK> <UNK> it's a wonder he completed his film at all br br 3 <UNK> the fictional director has set herself the task of creating a brand new 1980s horror flick fat chance i doubt it can be done these days i suspect that <UNK> the actual and more talented director set himself the same task realised it couldn't be done and settled for sigh knowing parody instead of course it's not enough of a parody to work as a parody as soon as the cast and crew set foot in the isolated mansion the film just spends most of its time doing badly what 1980s horror films did well less badly br br 4 and yet and yet the film opens with not a parody but an honest to goodness <UNK> of 80s horror starring this is too good to be true molly <UNK> this <UNK> is much better than anything that follows it's a bad sign when you find yourself wishing you were watching the movie within the movie rather than the movie yet it too was filmed in the late 1990s perhaps it is still possible to make 1980s horror you just have to drop the knowing parody stuff and mean it br br 5 i'd never once wondered what 1980s teen horror would be like if all the characters had australian accents but now i know and strangely i'm glad i know a need i never knew i had has been <UNK>
<START> one wonders why this picture was made at all the plot as such is totally unbelievable if not ridiculous the characters experienced loner cop versus younger one quite fascinated quite predictable the ending totally murky and impossible to understand maybe after several viewings but you'd have to have a <UNK> tendency for that the idea being you have to read the book to understand fully what it's all about and the acting is bad was the basic idea to show that french film makers are able to do as well as americans in the genre that include seven and silence of the <UNK> if so it is a total failure it was quite a success though and has a sort of cult status as the first french serial killer film and it seems considered as a good product to <UNK> strange
<START> how to lose friends alienate people is not based on tiger <UNK> <UNK> it is a mediocre romantic comedy based on toby <UNK> book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities the film stars simon pegg as sidney young a zany british journalist who takes a job in an <UNK> celebrity magazine in new york young is restless in getting caught up all type of <UNK> to alienate all around him hence movie title he is <UNK> daring and moronic but nevertheless for some very bizarre reason he is a somewhat likable character sidney befriends a fellow journalist the composed alison olsen played quite admirably by kirsten dunst however sidney is primarily longing for the <UNK> actress sophie <UNK> played by the fantastic ms <UNK> fox this <UNK> is short on acting <UNK> but high on eye candy material sidney gets in all kinds of <UNK> in order to move up the journalist ladder in the magazine co those are the peak comedic moments of the film however i think that director robert <UNK> and screenwriter peter <UNK> might lose some viewers and <UNK> authentic <UNK> com material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between sidney alison even though team <UNK> did <UNK> an entertaining narrative otherwise pegg did <UNK> his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as sidney young jeff bridges was again building the dude bridges with his enigmatic supporting work as <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> suave <UNK> but the rest of the film's acting was not worthy enough to feature here how to lose friends alienate people should not be <UNK> entirely but you might lose some movie friends if you <UNK> it as a <UNK> romantic comedy average
<START> as romantic comedies go this was a cute and winning one i thought that the writing could have been stronger to build up the final connection a bit better but that is not a huge <UNK> point but amanda <UNK> and scott wolf give nice performances and are as charming as ever these are two of my favorite actors and i was just glad to see them cast as romantic leads i hope to see them cast in more projects soon br br overall this movie won't change your life but is is sweet warm and winning not a bad thing to be at all
<START> i rented this movie on dvd without knowing what to expect and as i am about to study film making in canada of all places i most certainly will bring this up in class br br the story centered around the probably most unlucky film team in the history of film itself is brilliantly written and the very talented actors manage to deliver every single pun on time br br if you simply couldn't laugh during hollywood north i suggest seeing a psychiatrist right away you might have serious issues br br besides the wonderful script i also noticed the great chemistry between actors deborah <UNK> <UNK> and matthew <UNK> where they really just acting jennifer <UNK> playing a hilariously bad actress and martin <UNK> also delivered a very edgy yet funny performance br br great film even better cast
<START> while the british produced some hilarious and slick sitcoms in the 1990s <UNK> <UNK> men behaving badly one foot in the grave etc the 70s were the real golden age br br in the 1970s there were whole new <UNK> to explore including the sexual revolution <UNK> and the slowly <UNK> awareness of a need for sensitivity that would twenty years later become political correctness attempts to <UNK> with the confusion of this thoroughly modern world were the subtle and not so subtle themes in everything from the skits of monty <UNK> flying circus to sitcoms like man about the house by the late 70s this <UNK> resulted in more <UNK> and bitter sweet sitcoms such as the masterpiece <UNK> br br man about the house is a perfect example of the good <UNK> of the time slightly <UNK> <UNK> fresh <UNK> sometimes outrageous with some well made observations on contemporary life compare it to a cynical 90s show such as <UNK> <UNK> and it is hard to believe the two were created in the same country br br man about the house is one of the great <UNK> of the 70s right up there with good neighbors the good life and about the <UNK> spin off george and mildred its quality is <UNK> to by the fact that as with good neighbors its creators writers and many of its cast have had continued success in british television
<START> <UNK> again from the darkness remember all the what happened to woody allen jokes even mr allen <UNK> fun at the fans who wanted him to continue making his same funny films as with any great artist mr allen's craft evolved over the years and he lost some fans while picking up others last year's masterpiece <UNK> showed he is still every bit as relevant and poignant as he was in the days of annie hall and manhattan what is most striking to us 40 plus year fans is that mr new york himself seems to have a bit of a crush on the mother country apparently he actually likes england while filming <UNK> mr allen became <UNK> with scarlett johansson and her real life spirit and sense of humor this attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years scarlett while <UNK> <UNK> must be given credit for not just picking films that cast her in some glamorous light she is <UNK> to look and act like a real person in scoop she flashes some real on screen comedy chops and in many scenes delivers the real punchline to mr allen's straight man of course any time mr allen decides to put himself in front of the camera he will get more than his share of one liners and social <UNK> in which is fine because few do it better br br very nice support work from ian <UNK> and hugh jackman in fact mr jackman provides a few glimpses into why many of us thought him the best choice to replace brosnan as the new bond as with most of allen's films the star is the script not the actors although scarlett delivers superbly here and is a nice contrast to the polished allen and jackman what makes this one <UNK> is the dialogue especially the banter between allen and scarlett if you are not a huge woody the actor fan fear not he does limit his screen time and he is quite effective except in two or three brief scenes that almost seem out of place another <UNK> tradition is a <UNK> musical background and scoop is no exception especially the <UNK> composition br br scoop is a nice cross between annie hall and the best of the marx brothers films or the cary grant comedies yes it is an adult comedy but it is actually very cute especially for a serial killer and talking ghost comedy
<START> i just don't understand why this movie is getting beat up in here <UNK> it is mindless it isn't polished and it is as i am reading wasted on some the cast of this movie plays their characters to the <UNK> if you watched permanent midnight and became a ben stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed these are misunderstood well <UNK> <UNK> trying to save the city world with nothing but <UNK> and determination the problem is they don't realize their limits until the big showdown and that's the point this is 3 times the movie that the spy who <UNK> me was yet gets <UNK> by the same <UNK> group likely the same people who feel the first <UNK> movie <UNK> in comparison to the sequel i just don't get it the jokes work on more then one level if you didn't get it i know what level you're at
<START> my husband is a huge robin williams fan i like him too but have generally found that he should stick to what he does best and focus on comedic roles my thoughts were confirmed with this movie i was completely bored throughout the entire film the story was predictable i realize it was inspired by a true story but my guess is that there could have been some suspense or intrigue even while maintaining truth in the story none of the characters were well developed there was a side story about the main character and his partner this relationship could have been explored further more important though would have been a deeper exploration of the mother of the boy her psychological profile would have been interesting to delve into she obviously has a long history that was not touched upon except in the most superficial way if my husband wasn't such a huge williams fan we would have left 20 minutes into it too bad i can't get my 20 or 2 hours back
<START> i saw this little <UNK> <UNK> for the first time very recently on one of those dollar dvd's that seem to be everywhere nowadays and was so moved by it that i cannot contain myself for those who have never seen this <UNK> miserable mexican <UNK> and wish to view it without being <UNK> by anyone else's <UNK> commentary there are undoubtedly substantial spoilers in what follows so if you are one of those reckless individuals stop reading at once and go and watch it for yourself if you get drunk enough in advance you might be fortunate enough to pass out before it's over br br begin with the premise that a man may become a werewolf after being bitten by a yeti no one in the film <UNK> an explanation as to how this sort of cross species <UNK> could occur and the rest of the movie is even more hopelessly nonsensical but pour yourself another glass of wine or whatever you're drinking and let us proceed br br paul naschy our werewolf has the look of a man fighting a <UNK> in a town where the only dentist has <UNK> his supply of <UNK> for a case of cheap <UNK> and has been drunk ever since ain't he the lucky one <UNK> facial expression never <UNK> whether in or out of makeup and apparently no one gave him any <UNK> on how to act like a werewolf occasionally he tries to imitate the <UNK> <UNK> jr <UNK> but most of the time he simply <UNK> around in his black mafia shirt like just another cool dude with a tad too much facial hair to be fair the makeup is actually better than the actor inside of it but the continuity is infinitely worse <UNK> werewolf is the only one i can think of that changes shirts twice in the middle of a <UNK> he goes from black shirt to red shirt then back to black then back to red then back to black all in a single <UNK> night interestingly enough he always does the <UNK> <UNK> while wearing the red shirt and the cool dude walk while wearing the black shirt and it's only while he is wearing the red shirt that we see much of the fury <UNK> to in the title presumably there's something about that red shirt that just brings out the animal in him br br so anyway after being bitten by the cross <UNK> yeti the poor <UNK> returns home from <UNK> to learn that his wife has been sleeping with one of his students the two <UNK> lovers try to murder him by <UNK> the <UNK> on his car he survives the wreck and makes it home just in time for a full moon then after chewing up his wife and her lover he wanders off again and somehow manages to get himself <UNK> but is that enough can they let this tormented <UNK> rest in peace not a chance he is <UNK> by a supposed female scientist with a hardcore s m fetish otherwise known as the doctor and definitely not a new incarnation of doctor who she <UNK> him up and <UNK> him away to her kinky <UNK> takes him down to the <UNK> chains him to the wall and gives him a damn good <UNK> presumably such a string of <UNK> ought to be enough to put a little fury into any <UNK> br br after his two <UNK> rampage our <UNK> spends most of the rest of the film wandering around the castle trying to find a way out and who can blame him in the course of his <UNK> he encounters a <UNK> incoherent assortment of clichés including a man dressed in medieval armor a curiously inept phantom of the opera <UNK> supposedly the doctor's father and a hard <UNK> <UNK> of bondage slaves br br so what's it all about one may reasonably ask one gets the vague impression that it has something to do with mind control and involves something the doctor calls <UNK> best guess i really have no idea how it's spelled if there even is such a thing mercifully the experiment ends in failure and most importantly it ends before one has time to <UNK> one's own leg off br br of course one doesn't really expect any sense from a film like this but at least it ought to be good for laughs this one isn't forget it buddy there is a <UNK> sort of <UNK> about this film from its <UNK> together <UNK> <UNK> ambiance to its atrocious cinematography and <UNK> musical score that defies even the most <UNK> attempts to get any mst3k type laughs out of it if it's not even good for that what the hell is it good for if <UNK> revenge could have somehow been <UNK> <UNK> and put on a dvd it would have looked exactly like this movie
<START> pointless <UNK> drivel meant to be a comedy but not one laugh in the whole film gratuitous violence often with guns what kind of <UNK> mentality can either make or say this is a good film 1 out of 10
<START> this movie is a lot like the movie hostel except with bad acting and not much suspense the gore elements are there but you don't really feel anything for the characters making the violence not very effective some parts are just strange like forcing a snake down <UNK> throat what's up with that is that supposed to be scary or gory it's just kind of stupid as for torture there really isn't any except for the guy getting blow <UNK> in the beginning which they don't show anyway the main bad guy keeps saying make them die slowly yet the butcher kills them all very fast the deaths are all relatively quick yes i did watch the <UNK> version so overall not the worst gore movie i've seen but not at all good either you won't miss anything if you skip this one
<START> yet again one of the most misunderstood <UNK> of my country has been twisted by <UNK> who cannot understand the <UNK> symbolism of the mother <UNK> in her dark forms the mother takes on the frightening form of <UNK> <UNK> to destroy our inner demons and to <UNK> our <UNK> and though blood sacrifice is given to <UNK> and <UNK> the events depicted in this film are just absurd the mother takes on a <UNK> form to be <UNK> to our inner demons limitations and ego when no other form will suffice it's also in her <UNK> form that she burns away all your <UNK> in the <UNK> fires that you <UNK> in your heart for her to dance on if you love her and she will bring you to reality and truth reality and truth has a dark side as well as light which serves a purpose the mother is the <UNK> of the physical universe as well she is nature nature can be cruel and destructive to maintain balance you cannot have growth and life without death and destruction <UNK> represents the force of destruction for the purpose of new growth and life both mundane and spiritual in the universe it's very outrageous to me that people who know nothing of india or it's <UNK> can just take one of our beloved <UNK> and use her like a cheap prostitute to make some low budget talentless horror film how dare they take our beloved mother and portray her as a horror that makes people chop their <UNK> off she is only horrific to those who are attached to their ego and who live in <UNK> greed anger and other inner demons it's very clear to me that the person who wrote this movie must have a very serious self <UNK> ego and serious inner demons to see <UNK> as so horrible and terrible when the ego drops away she becomes a form that is enchanting beautiful and young a beauty that is so enchanting to behold that she <UNK> the entire universe with it <UNK> <UNK> is an ancient mother not to be <UNK> with for the sake of entertainment let's just hope that in her endless compassion and mercy that she does not take on <UNK> form to those involved with this movie br br the <UNK> that <UNK> have in using <UNK> like my own or the <UNK> of the <UNK> islands such as <UNK> and <UNK> which are actually very positive and other such <UNK> to twist and <UNK> misunderstood elements that the western mind cannot comprehend is totally ridiculous it's clear that there is no respect for what people live breathe and believe in when it comes to these kind of flicks br br <UNK> <UNK> in reality is a caring and compassionate mother whom we shed tears at her beautiful feet in devotion and love for and i am happy that my mother takes on <UNK> form sometimes to protect her <UNK> from themselves and from outside forces br br many <UNK> to the real <UNK> <UNK> who has shown many the path of god and realization
<START> i was expecting a little something from k <UNK> i mean it did look like a cute movie that i could get into i always did love the dog comedy movies but it looked like it was supposed to be <UNK> movie not jerry lee's the plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn't have chemistry to begin with not to mention that james seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction james just really <UNK> me off for more than half the film the dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out <UNK> the actors br br so i'm glad it's not just me on imdb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie but hopefully james will realize it was his brother jim who was the talented one no offense but not everyone can be their star sibling don't you wish <UNK> simpson would take that same advice d br br 3 10
<START> based on the personal experiences of director john <UNK> time at the university of southern california comes higher learning a film centered on the racial politics that occur at modern day <UNK> br br there are three main characters to which the film <UNK> its foundation around for its story <UNK> williams an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is an african american male <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> soft white girl and <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> white male all three are overcome by the sudden realities that college life is not as good as it is advertised as all three go through disappointment by being <UNK> <UNK> by being naive <UNK> and by being <UNK> <UNK> br br one good thing about the film is that it does show that modern american <UNK> are just high schools <UNK> large the <UNK> are not places to build character develop potential or enhance personal <UNK> but they are <UNK> used to gather all sorts of students in a one size fits all atmosphere it is an experience that usually is built for failure for most students it would have been good if the film built it story about this travesty rather than racial politics br br but it didn't and that's where the films falls apart <UNK> it seems had a pretty bad experience at southern california through this film he lets it all hang out there is no need to beat around the bush here <UNK> lets the heroes and the villains of this piece be easily seen br br the black characters in the film are pretty much seen as the heroes here while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains save for <UNK> who was raped by a fellow white student br br who can understand the inconsistencies of this film black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points out to them who supposedly raped her the ease that the black gang members have at the university while a bunch of skin heads meet in a dark small <UNK> planning violence br br the performances of omar <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are disappointing they do seem like the third choices for the roles that they played in this movie <UNK> <UNK> and drew barrymore were supposed to play <UNK> and <UNK> but were <UNK> <UNK> jackson aka ice cube <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> king were all irritating in their respective roles and laurence fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history professor only michael <UNK> did well in this film and he did considering that his character of the three main characters changed the most in the film br br john <UNK> wanted to take on the matter of race and <UNK> in american college life with this film and he did so quite badly it was sort like killing a fly with a shotgun life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over and he should know this higher learning is proof that he did not understand this at all seeing the film then and now would only confuse disappoint and <UNK> the same public he would wish to speak to not to mention it would not entertain them in the slightest
<START> the plot a crime lord is <UNK> 3 different <UNK> in an <UNK> to buy an island that would then serve as money <UNK> facility for organized crime to <UNK> that the fbi tries to bust one of the mafia <UNK> the thing goes wrong and by some unlikely plot twists and turns we are presented with another cop buddies who don't like each other movie one being a female fbi agent and the other a male ex <UNK> agent br br so far so stupid but the strength of this movie does not lie in its story a poor joke at best it is funny at least the <UNK> german version is the action is good too with a memorable scene involving a shot gun and a rocket <UNK> but the focus is <UNK> on the humour not intelligent satire not quite slapstick but somewhere in between you get a lot of funny jokes br br however this film is the opposite of political correctness legal drug abuse is featured <UNK> without criticism and even displaying it as cool that's the bit of the movie that seriously annoyed me and <UNK> it <UNK> for kids in my opinion br br all in all for a nice evening watching come acceptable action with some funny jokes this movie is perfect just remember in this genre it is common to leave your brain at the door when you enter the cinema tv room then you'll have a good time 8 10
<START> when a stiff turns up with <UNK> plague a <UNK> of <UNK> plague u s public health service official dr <UNK> reed richard widmark immediately <UNK> everyone whom he knows was near the body unfortunately the stiff got that way by being murdered and there's a good chance that the murderer will start <UNK> the plague leading to an <UNK> enter police captain tom warren paul douglas who is <UNK> to track down the murderer as soon as possible and <UNK> a possible national disaster br br while panic in the streets is a quality film it suffers from being slightly <UNK> and a bit too <UNK> my reason for bringing the score down to an eight it wanders the genres from <UNK> gangster to medical disaster police <UNK> thriller and even romance br br this is not director <UNK> <UNK> best work but saying that is a bit <UNK> kazan is the <UNK> responsible such masterpieces as a <UNK> named desire 1951 on the <UNK> 1954 and east of <UNK> 1955 after all this film <UNK> those but kazan has said that he was already <UNK> by the studio taking that freedom too far may partially account for the <UNK> the film is set in new orleans a city where kazan used to wander around night and day so i knew it well he wanted to exploit the environment it's so terrific and colorful i wanted <UNK> steam <UNK> <UNK> jazz <UNK> all of new orleans br br kazan handles each genre of panic in the streets well but they could be connected better the film would have <UNK> by staying with just one or two of its <UNK> the <UNK> in terms of setting would have still worked part of the dilemma may have been caused by the fact that panic in the streets was an attempt to <UNK> two stories by writers <UNK> and edward <UNK> <UNK> and some like 'em cold br br the gangster material which ends up in firmly in thriller territory with an extended chase scene near the end of the film is probably the highlight not surprisingly kazan has said that he believes the villains are more colorful i never had much affection for the good guys anyway i don't like <UNK> a close second is the only material that approaches the panic of the title the discovery of the plague and the attempts to track down the exposed <UNK> them and contain the disease while there is plenty of suspense during these two <UNK> much of the film is also a fairly straightforward drama with pacing more typical of that genre br br the dialogue throughout is excellent the <UNK> difference to many modern films could hardly be more <UNK> it is intelligent delivered quickly and well <UNK> by each character conflict isn't created by dumb decisions but smart moves events and characters' actions are more like a chess game when unusual <UNK> are taken such as reed <UNK> the plague from the <UNK> he gives relatively lengthy <UNK> for his decisions which other characters argue over br br in light of this it's interesting that kazan believed that <UNK> religion <UNK> and the middle class are all murdering us that idea works its way into the film through the <UNK> to the norm or <UNK> away from it made by the protagonists for example head gangster <UNK> jack palance in his first film role is offered a get out of jail free card if he'll <UNK> with <UNK> the plague br br the technical aspects of the film are fine if nothing exceptional but the real reasons to watch are the performances the intriguing scenario and the well written dialogue
<START> i never like to comment on a good film but when it comes to a bad movie i gotta come really hard on it talking about vivah this guy <UNK> <UNK> seems to have completely lost it after success of hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he thought he can make money with cheesy wedding videos vivah is so so cheesy that <UNK> have left <UNK> and <UNK> behind br br there was not a single moment during the movie where i can say <UNK> at least this thing is <UNK> <UNK> does cliché in a role of girl's father shahid kapoor looks fat and <UNK> amrita <UNK> is another disaster in addition to ugly looking sets bad costumes hackneyed storyline monstrous stepmother trying hard to act actors <UNK> background music cheap <UNK> br br now the spoiler i'm warning you guys that as happens in all his other movies after a <UNK> <UNK> movie ends on a happy note
<START> you know i can take the blood and the sex but that <UNK> bikini shot pretty much did me in someone get that girl some <UNK> before it's too late br br and you know it's just not a good idea for a schlock movie to start off by mentioning the much better movie it's ripping off br br i gave this one a 2 just because it's <UNK> better than tobe <UNK> crocodile
<START> what a gem of a movie so good that they made a sequel br br the film starts off really good with a nasty monster who eats a few people and a party where the 2 main characters first set eyes on each other br br <UNK> hughes plays the eccentric <UNK> a bit of an <UNK> there to who this character is who has moved into town and uses the services of a particular real estate agent to find him a house br br hell we've all seen vampire movies we know the format br br the movie is watchable but the actors' performances are very wooden and they seem as they don't want to be in this film but may be that's just all part of the <UNK> ambiance br br didn't like the ending but there is a sequel must track it down br br when i watched the film i thought brendan hughes didn't really fit the part later on i couldn't stop thinking about him he sort of exudes an eerie <UNK> so maybe he was right for the part br br brendan hughes last seen in <UNK> the rise of <UNK> as lt <UNK> br br where is he now
<START> what another reviewer called lack of character development i call understatement the movie didn't bash one over the head with <UNK> or unnecessary <UNK> yes there were many <UNK> stories that we only got a glimpse of but this was primarily a one day <UNK> into an event that <UNK> change in all of the characters' lives henry <UNK> performance was a really lovely study in the power of acting that focuses on reaction rather than action good rental
<START> first i bought it at the video store second i watched it third it was boring fourth it was not funny fifth most of the antics were lame and last but not least it's not only a bad movie it's a total fiasco br br i am a huge adam sandler fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film i pity it because it was his first movie even if you are a huge adam sandler fan don't bother watching this movie instead just take the video board a <UNK> and throw it overboard
<START> i remember watching this is its original airing in <UNK> as a five or six year old and really enjoying this i recently had the opportunity to watch it again for the first time since then as it was aired on walt disney presents on the disney channel i'd forgotten most of it and some of it was <UNK> towards kids but it was still enjoyable i can't wait to show it to my niece and <UNK>
<START> serum starts out with credits that are quite reminiscent of the re animator movies and it owes a lot to them the story is very similar a mad doctor develops a serum that he believes will <UNK> pain sickness and death but he's apparently not a big believer in <UNK> trials and so winds up with a brain eating zombie on his hands in the person of his nephew the zombie even looks like one of those from re animator and in fact some of the make up effects in serum aren't bad unfortunately the script is pretty slow and unbelievable in quite a few places resulting in a soap opera feel for most of the first 3 4 of the movie for some reason the director feels compelled to tell us the time of day every few minutes by flashing it in big white letters across the screen i can't see why this was important other than being an attempt to provide viewers with a sense of time passing sometimes that wouldn't be present otherwise as the plot <UNK> along br br there are a number of moments that just don't add up here for instance one victim is <UNK> with a <UNK> hammer but when we see the <UNK> head up close there's no sign of that trauma in another scene a character runs down a fully lit hospital <UNK> we can see the circles of light on the floor in fact with a <UNK> in hand looking for all the world like he's walking in the dark but a moment later a second character walks down the same fully lit <UNK> without one these are just a couple of examples moments of what look like directorial or <UNK> <UNK> crop up quite frequently throughout the movie br br serum is better in some ways than much of what goes straight to video as independent horror lately in terms of technical items  sound and photography for example  it's got a more polished look than a lot of what lands on a dvd on the other hand there's still a good deal of wooden acting particularly by one of the lead characters the mad scientist himself and nonsensical moments that have nothing to do with suspension of disbelief and everything to do with writing and continuity maybe these are things that the people involved with making this film will eventually get more experience with though one of the problems with low budget independent horror lately is that the filmmakers often set out to remake more popular movies that had bigger budgets and that almost never works out it didn't in the case of serum anyhow
<START> there are many kinds of reunion shows one kind is where old actors are taken out of <UNK> and set to recreate characters they haven't played for twenty or thirty years these have mixed results return to <UNK> despite some silliness was okay return to green <UNK> as <UNK> eddie albert used a word for the script i won't repeat here but both it and the movie stink rescue from <UNK> <UNK> filled in a necessary gap in the story of the <UNK> though the show itself was silly even from a <UNK> <UNK> viewpoint in most cases the scripts are weak sometimes a silliness appears in the scripts that is too knowing  and in comedy it's nearly always fatal for the characters to know they're being funny new characters are introduced who don't fit the mix in the main these reunion shows are pretty weak a second sort of <UNK> show is the kind where the cast lays its past aside but sits around telling stories <UNK> interspersed with flashbacks from the shows then there are movies based on the shows which are rarely good and movies based on the history of the show the brady <UNK> has had both of these happen to it with various results br br return to the <UNK> uses nearly all the above with a wonderfully twisted viewpoint which makes it the best of the reunion shows and has raised the bar for the others br br adam west and burt ward and <UNK> to a showing of the original <UNK> while they are there the car is stolen br br the adam west of the movie is a man demented he called jerry his butler <UNK> he opens a bust of shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to slide down to the parking garage he's obsessed with being a crime fighter when in fact he's merely a washed up actor when the <UNK> is stolen he not only believes it's his duty as a crime fighter to recover it he drags and unwilling burt ward in as his assistant br br the pursuit is largely <UNK> with west and ward <UNK> about the old days it is broken by <UNK> with actors playing west and ward in the old days the modern scenes and the <UNK> both have the wacky lack of reality the show <UNK> there are also running gags that show west is able to make fun of himself in <UNK> book about his time on the show he spoke frankly about <UNK> <UNK> and also his being a <UNK> west makes ward pay for everything in their pursuit down to <UNK> and bus fare the clues they follow the characters they meet even in flashback all fit the mentality of the old series and there are several <UNK> including a fist fight with written sound effects br br the whole thing is extremely funny and done with great <UNK> there are also cameos by julie <UNK> looking like she's had one <UNK> too many and frank <UNK> reminding us why he has such a cult following <UNK> will be the <UNK> when jim carey his obvious <UNK> is long forgotten the movie builds to a fairly obvious but funny climax br br this show is a model for reunion shows  unfortunately there are few that can fit the pattern this show had actors <UNK> their old characters young actors playing a movie about the making of the show the actors west and ward <UNK> and a modern day movie with the real adam west playing the demented adam west it has everything if you loved the old show this is the <UNK> on the bottle
<START> i think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial africa in the 50's and 60's rather than as a story because there is no real story here just one <UNK> on top of another like little points of light that don't mean much until you have enough to paint a picture the first time i saw <UNK> i didn't really get it until having thought about it for a few days then i realized there were lots of things to get including the end of <UNK> which was but around the corner just no plot anyway it's one of my all time favorite movies the scene at the airport with the brief shower and beautiful music was sheer poetry if you like exciting movies don't watch this you'll be bored to tears but for some of you you can thank me later for <UNK> it to you
<START> normally i don't like series at all they're all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast br br these series however are well played the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one the story will still be catching your mind br br the episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital
<START> in <UNK> <UNK> love crimes 1992 sean young plays a gritty d a in <UNK> she's a loner who gets herself too deeply involved in the case of a man patrick <UNK> who poses as a famous fashion photographer and <UNK> women takes <UNK> photos of them then leaves them br br naturally this tough loner decides to enter the phony <UNK> life by posing as his prey <UNK> to bring him to justice they meet they make love then the next thing she knows she is over his lap getting <UNK> note the <UNK> scene is only in the <UNK> version of this film the r rated version <UNK> it and several other scenes that would make the plot more <UNK> this psychological thriller includes several scenes of female nudity and disturbing images such as <UNK> chasing one of his victims around the room <UNK> at her with a riding crop br br as a thriller love crimes is at its best when sean young is playing her cat and mouse game with <UNK> trying to catch him in an <UNK> act it's unfortunate that the film doesn't end it just stops that's true director <UNK> <UNK> may have just run out of story to tell but after <UNK> minutes the credits roll and we are left with a puzzling what just happened <UNK> br br the unfolding of <UNK> plan is played out in engaging style but the lack of a coherent ending will be a turn off for some viewers br br dan <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> scarecrows is one of those films that with a little more acting a little more direction and a lot more story logic would have been quite compelling as a horror entry as it stands it is still a creepy film that has solid make up and gore effects and a premise that <UNK> the mood of terror in spite of itself and hey there are no teenagers getting killed one by one just dumb adults so that is a refreshing change of pace and the plot line is amazingly similar to dead birds with a <UNK> robbery an abandoned spooky house in the middle of nowhere and demonic monsters but just like dead birds the adults are still witless they run around <UNK> before getting slaughtered one by one and they ignore the obvious danger br br in scarecrows though we never really find out the supernatural why and that <UNK> the atmosphere of creepiness and like <UNK> scarecrows can be very creepy unless they look like ray <UNK> of course escaping in a <UNK> plane with the pilot and his daughter after a robbery <UNK> millions a <UNK> military bunch is double crossed by one of their own a very nervous guy named burt he jumps out of the plane with the big and heavy box that holds the money with apparently no plans as to how to move it around once he is on the ground being the dumbest of the bunch he is murdered first but not before he happens upon the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> amid lots of really creepy looking scarecrows and surrounded with a wooden fence <UNK> with <UNK> wire and lots of <UNK> to stay away and the weird <UNK> on the roof with the <UNK> and <UNK> should have been a warning sign too the inside of the house is also quite foreboding to us in the audience anyway br br annoyingly we must listen to <UNK> thoughts in voice over as he walks around and mysteriously comes across the key to the <UNK> truck in the yard the way the key pops up would be enough to have my pants with me in them flying out the door perhaps it's just me but i really enjoy watching people's lips move on screen even when they are just thinking out loud it helps to <UNK> the action and gives the actor more to do than just look like what the voice over is saying burt <UNK> the box onto the truck and makes his <UNK> sure why not <UNK> <UNK> always have lots of gas in them especially with today's <UNK> and the <UNK> no problem now i did mention that burt was the dumbest of the bunch and here is why in addition to the above of course wearing night vision <UNK> to walk through the <UNK> and find the house he takes them off to drive the truck away and instead turns on the <UNK> to see where he is going of course the crooks still in the plane spot the <UNK> of his truck and know where he is headed brilliant he deserves to die definitely i am not sure why he needed night vision <UNK> in the first place as every scene is <UNK> lit from the interior of the plane to the night time outside scenery and the house the cinematographer was either a <UNK> b just out of school or c dealing with really cheap <UNK> br br burt meets his demise when the truck dies in the middle of nowhere go figure one very nice touch and there are i must admit a few in the film is the fact that when he opens the <UNK> <UNK> there is no engine creepy to be sure and insert pants comment again here the story logic fails when dead now stuffed like a <UNK> with money and straw burt returns to the house the rest of the bunch are there rough him up then realize that he is indeed dead and was <UNK> and stuffed like a <UNK> with money and straw dead burt does manage to put up quite a fight though and grabs one fellow by the mouth pushing him through a window causing him to bite off more than he could chew in a <UNK> scene at this point you would think they'd would be racing out of the house and back to the plane but <UNK> they decide to stay and look for the rest of the money in fact the whole burt is dead episode is treated rather matter of <UNK> although one bright <UNK> in the bunch does argue burt was walking around dead for <UNK> br br the stolen money suddenly appears on the grounds outside the house and the crooks <UNK> go for the bait soon another one of them jack is <UNK> and again the scene is well done and horrific involving a dull <UNK> and no <UNK> now there are three scarecrows going about <UNK> mayhem and one of them needs a hand literally br br when one of the crooks sees the scarecrows and jack getting scarecrow <UNK> he starts screaming running away like hell and shooting off his gun in typical <UNK> military fashion so much for all that training under pressure crap he meets up with the others and stops in his tracks to explain why he is screaming running away like hell and shooting off his gun even though the scarecrows appear to be chasing him again that script logic thing dead and <UNK> jack returns to the house and goes after the <UNK> with the usual results if you listen to jack's demonic <UNK> by the way you may notice depending on your age that it is the same monster <UNK> sound heard often in the lost in space tv episodes br br the last two survivors race away from the house and back to the plane barely escaping but do they you will have to see the film to find out
<START> when i was 16 i saw the documentary a funny thing happened on the way to the moon i actually liked and believed in it for a couple of years but then i grew up and began to think and when i had sought more information this is more info from reel sources and non biased sources when i started at university not so long ago i asked an assistant professor in <UNK> about these conspiracy theories what he said shocked me he said that all those theories where lies that <UNK> me i did not believe it first but then he presented evidence for his claims he quickly <UNK> most of the theories about the subject humans did not go to the moon the most <UNK> claim was that the apollo craft could not travel through the van allen radiation belt without the crew <UNK> from radiation the truth is that the americans use a secret <UNK> anti radiation <UNK> it is not that well known and the exact <UNK> are a secret and why is it a secret well why should they reveal it back then if they where in a space race with the russians then it would be very dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation br br and then there is the biggest evidence of all the moon stones when the apollo missions did go to the moon they brought back many rocks from the moon to give to <UNK> and similar scientists who are <UNK> all things about the moon these rocks and stones are in fact from the moon because the internal basic elements which all matter consist of are also made of special <UNK> that are different from <UNK> to <UNK> land to land and especially planet from planet the <UNK> of these rocks and stones have been proved that they do not come from earth the <UNK> brought home hundreds of <UNK> of these rocks all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth and from the same planet <UNK> the moon <UNK> where not fake <UNK> did go to another planet the moon though it is not a planet but a satellite to a planet a moon <UNK> these rocks have been distributed to <UNK> and <UNK> all around the world it has been proved humans did go to the moon it is a fact <UNK> br br but i do not worry most conspiracy <UNK> are generally unemployed and <UNK> that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts the fact remains humans did walk on the moon
<START> i'd passed this title 15 or 20 times while in blockbuster looking for something halfway decent to watch all i can say is that they were all out halfway decent films the night i chose to rent this br br i will give it credit for being leaps and <UNK> better than dracula 3000 but in <UNK> that's pretty easy to say since this one didn't have caper van <UNK> in it the other things it lacked in <UNK> were an interesting cast interesting story good dialog and originality but i suppose you can't have everything br br spoilers ahead the <UNK> crew of vampire hunters one of which was a vampire go figure flew around from mining colony to mining colony trying to wipe out all the vampires it could find the crew consists of the cocky <UNK> do well captain who dies early on his by the book yet inexperienced first mate the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter not a <UNK> a wannabe cowboy and a really really butch asian <UNK> tough guy female it almost sounds like the cast for <UNK> 'the real <UNK> after the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a mob of <UNK> and as it turns out lovers of the <UNK> parts of human <UNK> his first mate takes over blah blah blah everyone hates him blah blah blah i could go on but as i said it's the same storyline used in about a hundred other <UNK> of the genre br br the effects were cheese and why michael <UNK> was in this movie is beyond me the vampire vampire hunter still not a <UNK> was pretty hot but of course if you're waiting for her to expose more than just her <UNK> look elsewhere br br i can't say that it was the worst film i've seen as i actually rented <UNK> troopers <UNK> but wait for this one to come on the sci fi channel
<START> i don't think that many films especially comedies have added memorable <UNK> dialog like moonstruck i won't illustrate it you can see a remarkably long list of quotes on this thread but any film that can make subjects like the defense of using expensive <UNK> <UNK> rather than <UNK> for <UNK> purposes into memorable dialog is amazing to me it is not the only line that pops up and makes an <UNK> on our memory how about a restaurant <UNK> who regrets a planned marriage <UNK> because it will mean the loss of an old bachelor client or a nice elderly dog <UNK> <UNK> his pack to <UNK> at he moon or perry john <UNK> description of a female <UNK> youthful promise as <UNK> in a <UNK> my favorite line br br moonstruck is a wonderful example of brilliant script first rate direction and a good ensemble cast that fits perfectly there are other examples the drama the <UNK> bow incident is another example but a <UNK> one cher olympia dukakis vincent <UNK> nicholas cage john <UNK> and danny aiello are all involved in plots and cross purposes that examine the nature of love and how to handle it is it a good thing to be totally in love cher and cage at the end seem to think so but dukakis knows that real love drives the individual crazy and cage gets a <UNK> of realization of this too when he and cher argue outside his home after they return from the opera la <UNK> is infidelity by men a way of avoiding thoughts of death dukakis believes so and oddly enough although he is not totally convinced aiello chance reveals infidelity dukakis realizes early that <UNK> odd behavior is tied to <UNK> and cher literally stumbles onto <UNK> and his girlfriend at the opera but <UNK> also stumbles onto <UNK> similar <UNK> to aiello but chance also causes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stumbles on dukakis walking with john <UNK> and thinks that she is having an affair br br there are lovely little moments in the film too <UNK> observation about flowers leading to receiving one her hearing the argument in the <UNK> shop and it's resolution but best is the sequence of louis <UNK> and julie <UNK> as <UNK> uncle and aunt raymond and rita <UNK> and <UNK> charming and kind comment to raymond about the effect of the <UNK> on him it is the <UNK> moment of the entire film br br it is close to a flawless film after seeing it over a dozen times in as many years i can only find two points that do not seem as smooth as they should be when cher is at <UNK> <UNK> his assistant <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mentions how she is secretly in love with cage but has been afraid to tell him earlier she was slightly <UNK> towards cher who put her in her place quickly yet nothing seems done with this potential rivalry at the same time the fact that cher forgets to <UNK> her uncle and <UNK> daily business <UNK> is brought in <UNK> in the <UNK> seven minutes of the film but just as quickly dropped was there supposed to be some plot lines that were dropped besides one about cher and vincent <UNK> working at a homeless man's shelter as <UNK> it is a small annoyance but i think it is just based on a desire to see more of this film because it is so very good
<START> admittedly i watched this piece with already very low expectations <UNK> <UNK> is a rather <UNK> composer <UNK> whose lack of talent is only <UNK> by the size of his ego br br this was the first cartoon movie that i watched that was 100 per <UNK> humor free it is rude offensive redneck and blatantly anti women as such it is a creation <UNK> <UNK> but the average viewer will be rather put off by it no wonder that it was never shown in a cinema theater it would've bombed big time br br not even the expense of 6 5 <UNK> were able to save this utter piece of crap save your time and money
<START> effort aside this isn't a review about good intentions its about the final product this film is poorly written <UNK> and poorly directed the story obviously had potential but that story is nowhere present in this film br br clara barton was a human being she had passions desires love pain embarrassment weakness and self doubt just like the rest of us you would never know that from this film of the lead <UNK> performance in fact apply that to every character in the film but in <UNK> case every sentence is a speech an epic over the top speech as though from an <UNK> robot in fact the only scene that plays well in one in the board meeting and i realized thats because she's making a speech every idea she has is unbelievable in its context and she comes up with ideas that sound like they take a lifetime of soul searching right on the spot for example when she sees a wounded man she'll start <UNK> about the needs of the battlefield and to protect soldiers and putting up white <UNK> etc as played in the film there's no way she could come up with such a detailed well thought out idea in seconds br br in conclusion this film <UNK> clara barton of her struggles it <UNK> her of her humanity and it <UNK> <UNK> all she did because the script is written in clichés the writer doesn't know clara barton and seems to have based his script on an <UNK> <UNK> article yes they had those back then but hey nice technicolor who cares
<START> this movie could had been an interesting character study and could had given some insight on its subject but real problem with this movie is that it doesn't have any of this in it it doesn't give any insight or <UNK> to the problem it's just the portrayal of <UNK> male sex addict and the problems this is creating for his every day normal life and family why would you want to watch this it's all so totally pointless and meaningless br br it also really doesn't help that the main character is some <UNK> 50 year old male you'll have a hard time <UNK> yourself and sympathize for him he just seems like a dirty old playboy who is an a constant hunt for woman and sex he has all kinds of sexual <UNK> about 3 times a day with different woman and not just only with prostitutes br br it also doesn't have a bad visual style though it all feels a bit forced but nevertheless it's all better looking than most other direct to video productions who knows if the film makers had been given better material to work with the movie would had deserved a better faith br br the story really gets <UNK> at times there are really some pointless plot lines that are often more laughable than they were obviously supposed to be i'm talking about for instance the whole <UNK> plot line things get worse once they movie starts heading toward the ending also the whole way the story is being told cutting back and forth between the events that happened and the main character's sessions with his psychiatrist feels a bit cheap and simple br br but as far as bad movies are concerned this just isn't one of them it's not really any better or worse than any other random straight to video flick with similar concepts br br still seems weird and quite amazing that they managed to cast <UNK> kinski and ed <UNK> jr in such a simple small insignificant production as this one is guess they were really desperate for work and money br br 4 10
<START> i wasn't particularly impressed by this movie that has lackluster music and only lasts 40 minutes thank god because i was falling asleep i makes excellent use of time <UNK> photography to display the passage of time in the movement of light and shadow people water clouds etc unfortunately that's all it is br br my <UNK> is for its predecessor the excellent <UNK> made in 1983 at <UNK> minutes and to prove that a sequel can be better than the original <UNK> made in 1988 running 90 minutes br br try them both
<START> the key to the 40 year old virgin is not merely that andy <UNK> is a 40 year old virgin but rather the manner in which steve carell presents him as one in a genre of crass comedy that has become <UNK> by its lack of humor and engaging characters the 40 year old virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent heartfelt script that doesn't use its protagonist as the butt end of cruel jokes that andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke in fact as it is a curiosity br br carell a veteran of team ferrell in anchorman and an ex daily show <UNK> uses the concept of the film to expand his character  we get to understand why andy is the way he is it's the little things that make this film work when <UNK> co worker at an <UNK> store asks him what he did for the weekend andy describes his failed efforts at cooking when andy rides his bike to work he <UNK> his turns he doesn't just <UNK> his home with action figures  he paints them and talks to them and reveals that some of the really old ones have <UNK> to him since childhood a lesser comedy wouldn't even begin to focus on all of these things br br the plot is fairly simplistic  <UNK> co worker pals find out he's never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman it's a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to <UNK> its <UNK> br br <UNK> friends are a <UNK> to his neurotic nature david paul rudd has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her jay <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> man and cal seth <UNK> is a <UNK> <UNK> their attempts at getting andy in the sack <UNK> numerous times and each time leaves andy feeling less and less optimistic br br finally andy meets single mom <UNK> played by catherine <UNK> and much to the <UNK> of his worrying buddies who claim mothers aren't worth it he falls in love with her they begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days  <UNK> being unaware that andy is still a virgin br br the 40 year old virgin was directed by judd <UNK> the man who produced anchorman and the cable guy and began the short lived cult tv show freaks and <UNK> <UNK> is renowned for his unique sense of humor and the script  co written by carell  offers plenty br br however in the end the most interesting and indeed surprising aspect of the 40 year old virgin is its maturity by now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics and even i was surprised by its warm reception but after seeing the film it's easy to understand why we like andy we care about him he's not just some cardboard <UNK> sex comedy cliché  he's a real living breathing person his neurotic traits combine the best of woody allen with childish <UNK> his friends are not unlikable <UNK> and his romance is <UNK> and bittersweet it strikes a <UNK> with the audience br br although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor it doesn't offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on screen the best sex comedies work this way  from <UNK> business to american pie  and that is the major difference between something like the 40 year old virgin and 40 days and 40 nights
<START> i liked this a lot in fact if i see it again and i plan to i just may love it i'll echo other reviewers in saying that this movie really does grow on you as you watch it starts kind of slowly but the way in <UNK> is very natural and has a mood to it you just get into it br br i really liked the <UNK> atmosphere to the movie and thought the movie was very touching as a whole the characters have a strong element of realism and the movie very slowly and gently weaves a spell as you get involved in the various interactions between them all and want to know how it will ultimately turn out and what paths the characters will choose to take br br i am very surprised that there are less then a dozen comments on this there are obscure tv movies that have more comments then rich in love br br one thing that i will say is i missed the ending which is driving me crazy and i have to watch it again to see that this is a movie that may not be for everybody but that i feel is strongly underrated even some of my most film buff <UNK> friends who have seen almost every movie there is haven't seen this and it doesn't even seem to have much of a message board but i liked it a lot and to all those who like family dramas that are warm on scenery atmosphere and an <UNK> <UNK> pace should probably take a look at this especially note worthy is that it takes place in south <UNK> so for those like me who love the south and movies that take place there this is a gem i'll add my vote to the woefully few comments and recommend this little known flick
<START> this animated inspector gadget movie is pretty lame the story is very weak and there is little action most of the characters are given little to nothing to do the movie is mildly entertaining at best but really doesn't go any where and is pointless it's watchable but only just and is nowhere near the <UNK> of the animated tv show from the 80's it's not a movie that bears repeat viewing at least in my mind it's only about <UNK> minutes long including credits so i guess that's a good thing unlike in the tv show the characters are not worth rooting for here in the show you wanted inspector gadget to save the day but there who really cares anyway that's just my opinion for me inspector <UNK> last case is a disappointing 3 10
<START> originally called the <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is a poorly constructed tale about a loner named joe <UNK> carl <UNK> who likes em young unable to socially interact with girls he <UNK> into a tramp who teaches him a special <UNK> <UNK> this <UNK> involves <UNK> <UNK> bridge is falling <UNK> whilst <UNK> around like an <UNK> morris dancer nonetheless ugly joe tries it out and hey <UNK> he is now a girl <UNK> he needs to be a young guy in order attract girls but lets not talk about ideals here this film was made in 1983 and released in 1993 in an ideal world it should have never been released br br the film asylum dubbed this horror <UNK> as mind numbing ham handed story telling its worse than that the <UNK> <UNK> really takes the <UNK> in fact the whole god damn cookie jar terribly scripted dialogue delivered by brain dead actors a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist just when things couldn't get any more absurd the story goes off on its own nonsensical <UNK> for instance joe decides to kill the girls by changing back into himself but i thought he wanted to get close to them not content with being a murderer joe also turns into a cannibal and eats some of his victims of which there were only around 3 4 br br the highlight of this terrible movie involves joe picking up a hooker steven andrews then taking her back to his apartment what happens next defies belief joe turns back into a man but also discovers the hooker is a man how does he react well in a benny hill esquire fashion he chases her around the apartment with a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> only to trip up on a blow up doll god knows what patrick j <UNK> and stephen <UNK> were thinking of at least this scene <UNK> the way for another priceless moment this involved the male hooker <UNK> the incident to a curly haired police officer with a 2 bit joke shop <UNK> uniform the hilarious acting is a must see especially the <UNK> inability at saying <UNK> and his demand for satisfaction br br apart from the above mentioned incident this monotonous slash flick was a complete bore you know a movie's bad when the dvd trailers were more exciting normally i'd fast forward to the good bits only there weren't any here the main action sequences involved joe simply stabbing his victims repeatedly forget quick cuts <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one during a stab scene to limit any form of suspense there might already be one girl's non reaction to her fingers being chopped off is laughable normally i'd <UNK> the words uncut but in this case they were far from a <UNK> just more <UNK> cinematic torture the whole movie felt like an <UNK> episode of <UNK> murders only less entertaining i'd hate to see the cut version br br to sum up the <UNK> <UNK> is the most <UNK> thing i've seen since richard <UNK> 5 <UNK> clock show dismal performances made worse by a terribly <UNK> soundtrack and bad dubbing don't be fooled by the box label this is not a cult classic unless it qualifies for the lets use <UNK> horror dvds for coffee <UNK> cult which i think it does unless re edited to 30 minutes stay away from this coma inducing mess
<START> i give this film it's props that it is very well made and reasonably well acted but i couldn't get past the <UNK> of the whole thing br br first and foremost a game built around the notion of russian <UNK> that has to fill on hour the big problem is that if you are doing a live show you run the possibility that your first contestant will be the one unlucky enough to draw the real bullet then what do you do you have 50 minutes of show to fill and nothing to show the <UNK> is that okay you get to the end and the first five contestants survive which means number six has the bullet and can't possibly get the <UNK> he isn't going to shoot himself at that point so it's kind of anti climatic br br second problem almost as big human nature people are going to <UNK> panic <UNK> their underwear and do things that would otherwise not make very good television too much <UNK> that's why real reality television is actually tightly scripted and even more tightly edited br br the only random thing is the performance <UNK> rant about female sacrifices which were actually rare historically even that was predictable since she went through with shooting herself to no effect br br we are led to believe the shows ratings would increase while it was going on at 1 am in the morning unlikely with the token asian girl <UNK> each boost in ratings br br a point on race and sex big surprise the movies two minority one gay and two female contestants are the ones who survive so we are left with the two white males and of course the slightly less likable of them is the one who buys it the purpose of such a show would be it's <UNK> but the guy you like the least is the guy who dies br br the climax is that after spending two hours fighting for <UNK> suicide the eva <UNK> character <UNK> produced and starred in this thing so she has no one to blame but herself actually grows a conscience when someone dies what did she think was going to happen she is promptly shot by a <UNK> angry about the whole thing motives never explained and the show went on to be a big hit really br br the problem with media satire is that it has to either have some <UNK> in reality or it has to be so over the top to be ludicrous like network this is neither
<START> this is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word <UNK> in order for it to be appreciated the main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and as with most younger children he gets frightened easily mainly because he simply doesn't understand things like why his father is hardly ever there for him from watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it but the little boy doesn't also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods as it is established early on in the film that the family is from the city also in the beginning as the family is traveling to the house they hit a deer then get held up then they argue with the locals about it and the little boy surely didn't find this introduction to the woods pleasant at all br br the wendigo is ultimately what his young innocent mind <UNK> to explain all of this there is the american indian legend but when looking at the scene where the young boy hears about about it it is explained to him like <UNK> and <UNK> not because that's what the wendigo actually is but because that is how he understands it when you look at the film from this point of view you can really begin to appreciate it obviously it was low budget and shot cheaply but the jumping montages use of light and general <UNK> more than make up for it and the final question the film asks is is it all in your head or is it really out there 8 10 br br rated r profanity violence and a sex scene
<START> robert deniro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time this movie is so <UNK> of talent it is truly disgusting the script is unbelievable the dialog is unbelievable jane <UNK> character is a caricature of herself and not a funny one the movie moves at a <UNK> pace is photographed in an ill advised manner and is <UNK> preachy it also <UNK> in every cliche in the book <UNK> <UNK> is excellent in a supporting role but so what br br equally annoying is this new imdb rule of <UNK> ten lines for every review when a movie is this worthless it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape avoid this movie
<START> love hurts that i think is the main message mike <UNK> <UNK> film reign over me brings across whether that love has caused your relationship to become <UNK> or has brought anger from the one you love cheating for years or has broken your heart to the point of being unable to open yourself up to the world love hurts the great thing about this film however is not in its portrayal of these lost souls trying to let their past <UNK> go but in the eventual <UNK> of new bonds for the future no one in this drama is perfect they are all at some degree trapped emotionally in relationships that they can't free themselves from alone there is some heavy subject material here and i credit <UNK> for never making the story turn into a political <UNK> but instead <UNK> the serious moments with some real nice comedic bits allowing the tale to stay character based and small in scale compared to the epic event that <UNK> <UNK> what could have become a trite vehicle for opinions on how 9 11 <UNK> us all ends up being a story about two men and a connection they share that is the only thing which can save their lives from a life of depression and regret br br this is a new career performance for adam sandler i like to think that my favorite director paul thomas anderson was the first to see the childish <UNK> up anger in his stupid comedies as something to use dramatically the <UNK> of a character like billy madison allows for laughs and <UNK> humor but also can be used to show a repressed man shy and <UNK> to the world around <UNK> man with no confidence that needs an event of compassion to break him from his shell anderson let sandler do just that in his masterpiece punch drunk love and mike <UNK> has taken it one step further sandler plays former dentist charlie <UNK> whose wife and three kids were killed in one of the planes that took down the world trade center on 9 11 that one moment crushed any life that he had and as a result he became <UNK> and started to believe he couldn't remember anything that happened before that day he really delivers a moving portrait of a man trying to keep up the <UNK> in his head while those around him those that love him try and open him up to the reality of what happened and what the future holds always on edge and ready to snap at any moment when something is mentioned to spark the memory of his <UNK> family he goes through life with his <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> out everything so as not to be tempted remember br br reign over me is not about charlie <UNK> though it is about dentist and family man alan johnson a man that has trapped himself into a marriage and dental practice that both have <UNK> into <UNK> johnson needs as much help in his life as his old college roommate charlie does played perfectly by the always brilliant don cheadle johnson has lost his <UNK> to try and change his life he has no friends and when he sees charlie by chance one day his life <UNK> into something he hasn't felt in 15 years he <UNK> in the chance to go out with an old friend no matter how much he has changed from the death of his family <UNK> character wants to <UNK> back to the college days of hanging out and <UNK> doesn't mind because all that was before he met his wife the two men get what they want and allow themselves to grow close despite the years of <UNK> that used to rule their lives once they begin opening up though it is inevitable that the subject of the tragedy will creep up and test the <UNK> they have created for themselves br br the supporting cast does an amazing job helping keep up appearances for the two leads <UNK> <UNK> smith has never been an actress that impressed me and throughout the film played the tough as nails wife nicely but it is her final scene on the phone with cheadle that really showed me something different and true <UNK> tyler is a bit out of her element as a psychiatrist but the movie calls her on this fact and makes the <UNK> perfect casting the many small cameos are also effective even writer director mike <UNK> role as <UNK> old best friend and <UNK> my only <UNK> here is why he feels the need to put his name in the opening credits as an actor when it is everywhere considering it is his film last but not least is the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> she is a great actress and plays the love crushed <UNK> trying to put her life back together wonderfully a role that seems comic relief at first but ends up being an integral aspect for what is to come br br <UNK> has crafted one of the best dramatic character studies i have seen in a long time the direction is almost flawless the <UNK> between cuts and characters in the <UNK> background really annoyed me in the beginning the acting superb and the story true to itself never taking the easy way out or <UNK> itself up with a neatly tied bow at the conclusion even the music was fantastic and used to enhance not to lead us emotionally why after two great uses of the titular song by the who did <UNK> feel the need to use the inferior eddie <UNK> remake for the end i don't know but it did unfortunately stick out for me reign over me is a film about love and how although it can cause the worst pain imaginable it can also save us from regret and allow us to once again see the world as a place of beauty and hope
<START> this movie was like any jimmy stewart film witty charming and very enjoyable kim <UNK> performance as gillian the beautiful witch who <UNK> to be human is splendid her subtle facial expressions her every move and gesture all create <UNK> unique and somewhat haunting character she left us hanging on her every word i should not fail to mention ernie <UNK> and elsa <UNK> highly commendable performances as the <UNK> loving writer obsessed with the world of magic <UNK> and the latter as the lovable aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to the romantic scenes between stewart and novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is great but then again when is the chemistry between jimmy stewart and any leading lady bad
<START> <UNK> is a young frenchman of <UNK> descent despite his muslim <UNK> he is very french in attitudes and values out of the blue his father <UNK> that <UNK> will be driving him to the <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> something that <UNK> has no interest in doing but agrees only out of <UNK> as a result from the start <UNK> is angry but being a traditional muslim man his father is difficult to talk to or discuss his <UNK> both father and son seem very rigid and <UNK> and it's very ironic when the dad tells his son that he should not be so stubborn br br when i read the summary it talks about how much the characters grew and began to know each other however i really don't think they did and that is the fascinating and sad aspect of the film sure there were times of understanding but so often there was an <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> i actually liked this and appreciated that there wasn't complete resolution of this as it would have seemed phony br br overall the film is well acted and fascinating giving <UNK> an unusual insight into islam and the <UNK> it also provides a fascinating <UNK> of traditional islam and the <UNK> younger generation while the slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship throughout the film may annoy some i think it gave the film intense realism and made it look like a film about people not some formula a nice and unusual film
<START> ah the infamous guinea pig series i honestly have to say that i've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series he never dies mermaid in a <UNK> and flower of flesh and blood being the exceptions and even those aren't great by any means but devil's experiment just plain blows there is nothing realistic looking going on here other than the climactic or perhaps anti climactic depending on how you view it <UNK> <UNK> scene the victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely <UNK> or <UNK> while being subjected to hideous more often sometimes hilarious <UNK> flower of flesh and blood is a more violent and gory depiction of fake snuff material but that film also falls flat on the realism level i applaud the japanese for pushing the boundaries and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in extreme film making but devil's experiment just doesn't hold up worth a look if you are a die hard if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about but i can only give this film an extremely generous 3 10 and that's only for the <UNK> through the eye scene
<START> if you're looking for a hollywood action packed kid flick with the common bad language and violence this may not be the film to sit down for if you're on the other hand interested in watching a film with <UNK> children that has actually some values like showing the importance of friendship and truth this is the film to watch looking at the program guide this is obviously what millions of other viewers have found not many low budget independent films have ever been aired as much as mr <UNK> the film is actually very funny as well as warm hearted and shows some beautiful locations masterfully captured by the sharp eye of the obvious brilliant cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> also if you're interested in looking at a muscular fellow with good looks the ladies can get an eye full let's support those who make good <UNK> film buy buying their videos and watching their products on tv enjoy
<START> the fourth of five westerns anthony mann did with james stewart this one involves a hard bitten <UNK> named jeff <UNK> who takes a cattle drive from <UNK> to <UNK> via seattle he <UNK> up in seattle with his partners ben <UNK> walter brennan and <UNK> morris jay c <UNK> that he has sent ahead of time in order to make <UNK> for the boat trip north br br but first he has to put up with <UNK> trail hands cheating <UNK> <UNK> and the charms of <UNK> manipulative <UNK> castle ruth roman who believes jeff could be a valuable ally in the future that's why she hides him out on the boat while the <UNK> looking for him for the earlier and <UNK> killing of a trail hand br br jeff also has the misfortune of running into sleazy judge gannon john mcintire who runs the town of <UNK> <UNK> gannon locks jeff up for <UNK> his public hanging by running his cattle through town he <UNK> jeff the <UNK> of his cattle and jeff just has to eat crow for the time being br br in the meantime jeff agrees to ride point for <UNK> up to dawson in order to deliver supplies but this is just a <UNK> so jeff ben and <UNK> can slip back into <UNK> and steal his cattle back of course judge gannon finds out about this and is right behind but is <UNK> by jeff with a rifle while ben races the cattle over the canadian border out of <UNK> reach br br after avoiding an <UNK> and another shootout with some other <UNK> men they finally reach dawson where jeff sells his cattle to the highest <UNK> which just happens to be <UNK> who then promptly sets up a new gambling house in dawson jeff then takes his money and buys himself a claim and starts <UNK> for gold br br but then judge gannon comes up to dawson to get in on the gold action up there and tells jeff that he was getting a little bored with <UNK> and wants to try his luck up in the <UNK> himself that involves bring some hired <UNK> with him and <UNK> stealing some of the other <UNK> claims jeff and ben now feel it's time to clear out while the goings are good leaving <UNK> to <UNK> for himself as a most <UNK> sheriff against gannon and his gang br br they look for a back way out only to find themselves <UNK> by <UNK> men because ben made the mistake of opening his big mouth ben is killed and jeff is severely wounded but that doesn't save judge gannon from his just due the ending shootout at night on the <UNK> dawson street pretty much takes care of that first jeff kills two of <UNK> best <UNK> jack <UNK> and robert <UNK> then as <UNK> comes out to warn jeff that gannon is trying to slip around behind him gannon shoots her in the back and she dies right there in <UNK> arms then jeff kills gannon as he's hiding under a wooden sidewalk revenge has spoken br br this is another rip roaring western that's right up there with the naked <UNK> and the man from <UNK> why the universal dvd uses a pan and <UNK> print instead of the widescreen print tcm uses is beyond me you'll wind up missing half the glorious <UNK> cinematography by william daniels so if you like well written 50s westerns then this one's an a list keeper br br 8 out of 10
<START> <UNK> performance almost made attack the screen it wasn't all bad i just think the <UNK> role was wrong for him br br ll cool j played the typical <UNK> role <UNK> <UNK> guy around i don't think the <UNK> a smile in the whole movie not even when <UNK> to his girlfriend br br morgan freeman pretty much carried the whole movie he was has some funny scenes which are the high point of the movie br br kevin spacey wasn't good or bad he was just there br br overall it's a dull movie bad plot a lot of bad acting or wrong roles for actors
<START> gillian <UNK> kim novak is a witch secretly she's attracted to her quite normal neighbor <UNK> henderson james stewart she casts a spell on <UNK> that forces him to dump his fiancé and fall for her things are going along quite nicely until gillian discovers she really cares for this mortal man she decides to tell him her secret but how will <UNK> react when he finds out that he was tricked into falling in love with gillian br br as far as light hearted 1950s comedies go bell book and candle is good but nothing spectacular it's an enjoyable enough watch and should appeal to almost anyone who sits down with it just don't go into the movie expecting the greatest thing since <UNK> bread the movie's cute funny at times and touching in the end kim novak and james stewart do their best and have some real chemistry novak as others have pointed out looks quite incredible in an understated sort of way the supporting cast with jack lemmon <UNK> <UNK> and elsa <UNK> is often laugh out loud funny and steals a lot of the spotlight from novak and stewart the biggest problem i see is that bell book and candle can't quite decide what kind of movie it wants to be is it a screwball comedy is it a romantic comedy is it a supernatural comedy had director richard <UNK> stuck with just one approach the movie might have been even better and more memorable
<START> i quite enjoyed this movie for two reasons the first is that it gives an insight into the world of <UNK> in northern ireland which is very rarely treated in movies most of which tell us about the <UNK> struggle the second reason is the performances of the actors i thought they gave very honest and convincing portrayals of a very seedy underworld that not many people hear about outside my native <UNK> br br all in all it is an entertaining <UNK> movie with stellar performances from a who's who in northern irish actors cast it wont move the earth although it may slightly open some peoples eyes to the murky world of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i finally purchased and added to my collection a copy of show people i cannot comment any more than what previous viewers have stated and to the characters plot and overall quality of this film without repeating their own words seeing the cameo out of character appearances of so many m g m silent stars is worth the viewing in and of itself i really like the scene where marion davies plays herself and is encountered by herself playing the main character of the movie patricia <UNK> make sure you read her lips as there is no title card <UNK> what she is saying when she sees marion davies but it is something to the effect of i don't think i like her pop the corn pop in the tape and get ready to go back more than three quarters of a century in movie making history enjoy
<START> i ordered this extremely rare and highly overrated movie on ebay with very high expectations i think i paid about 50 for this movie as an eternal fan of horror from cheesy 80s american slashers to european zombie films i told myself this was going to be great i can't tell you how wrong i was first of all i thought it was gonna be pretty much <UNK> than it actually is after all i've had heard about this film i was almost scared to watch it the murders are boring the acting forget it there's no acting the story even if we don't care is incredibly bad it seems they tried to get your attention with some weird sexual scenes and naked girls but unfortunately in this case it doesn't help the movie why there's no atmosphere and this is the worst thing about this flick it's just bad film making from point a to b though it's extremely funny and amusing to watch with your friends and a lot of beers don't make any effort to get your hands on it there are so many movies in this world don't waste your time watching <UNK> files
<START> this movie was incredible i would recommend it to anyone much better than what i had already anticipated it was definitely a heart wrenching spectacular movie it is an amazing story with amazing actors and creators definitely another great movie with denzel washington shouldn't surprise anyone derek luke did a wonderful job as well
<START> this movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre which is my favorite genre of them all so when i saw it was free on demand i had to watch it it stars caroline <UNK> from both dr <UNK> films she was his wife that died dracula a d 1972 the golden voyage of <UNK> captain <UNK> vampire hunter the spy who loved me maniac and <UNK> br br brought to you by the people behind don't open <UNK> christmas and pieces <UNK> my thoughts on this br br it opens on april fools day where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd promising him sex in the shower and giving him public <UNK> and a face in the toilet all while hes naked the coach puts a stop to it but both parties swear revenge but the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive br br cut to the future and its <UNK> high school reunion or so they think <UNK> the only ones with <UNK> were the gang who burned the kid and its april fools day or really the day before april fools but the fun starts at midnight yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until <UNK> then they finally break into the school and it starts <UNK> br br inside they find food drink and a little <UNK> for each of them each of their <UNK> and <UNK> along with <UNK> the <UNK> locker and <UNK> they also find the old black janitor caretaker who spends his time saying <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i don't want no trouble sir and then is killed instantly pretty pointless character but hes still my favorite br br the movie takes a page out of <UNK> book in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see thats when everyone realizes that they're there to die and they start freaking out except for shirley who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school <UNK> at a time like this of course it <UNK> out blood and acid and her face <UNK> off very cool mind you the rest of the night goes as usual sex drugs and marty killing everyone whilst wearing a <UNK> mask whats their plan all we have to do is stay awake and wait till <UNK> marty wont kill us during mid day seriously thats what he said apparently you can only kill at <UNK> but will they survive through the night who will live and who will die and why are all the bodies disappearing rent buy or steal this great movie to find out the movie is actually very good filled with clichés car wont start <UNK> and just plain slasher fun not to mention they all have names like carol and <UNK> and frank and joe and susan i recommend it to all of you and not to mention it has a spin off <UNK> cutting class is a spin off from this slasher gem and that movie starts the career of brad pitt and <UNK> mcdowell br br favorite scene 2 people having sex the guy wants to finish but the girl doesn't talk dirty to me frank she screams uh tits <UNK> uh tits f <UNK> tits boobs f <UNK> it seems to work for her and at her climax the killer <UNK> them both
<START> i do not believe all the praise for this movie the play and movie were a ripoff of sleuth michael caine wishes he were olivier and reeves wishes he were caine caine even had the nerve to do a remake of sleuth with jude law playing his original part jude law you mean the one that did the remake of <UNK> br br this movie was made during a period of <UNK> career when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling <UNK> he would do anything for money he would star in such award winning movies such as this and beyond the <UNK> adventure what seems to be driving the praise for this movie is reeves death he deserves better than to be remembered for this lousy movie and so does caine this movie can be found in the 5 <UNK> bin at <UNK> along with gems like the island and blame it on <UNK>
<START> watching <UNK> surrender dorothy i kept wondering why diane keaton would want to be in it not because it's a television movie with the <UNK> of <UNK> roles for slightly older actresses it isn't any wonder why academy award winning performers such as keaton turn to tv but because it offers no opportunities for keaton to shine a single mother <UNK> the sudden death of her twenty something daughter <UNK> upon and gradually becomes friends with the group of young people her daughter was close to at the time of her accident adapted from the novel this <UNK> gives us a group of self absorbed characters one would cross the street to avoid aside from being coarse and dim these phony people are incredibly unconvincing as is the <UNK> scenario and the <UNK> near the beach where the kids <UNK> one young man who wears muscle shirts to tell us he's gay hears diane keaton say surrender dorothy and actually asks that's from the wizard of oz right no genius it's from citizen kane keaton may have wanted to do this material based on the subject matter of confronting death she tries turning this distinctly unlikable woman into a shadow of her own <UNK> lots of <UNK> outfits but it doesn't sit well with the viewer since keaton has always been <UNK> likable and <UNK> in a <UNK> way here she's a crazed <UNK> who doesn't learn many lessons on her journey of self discovery the movie quickly forgets it's about a dead young woman and becomes an odyssey for the nervous wreck of a mom who appears to be an <UNK> hippie who has never lost anyone close to her this is the kind of film actors promote on talk shows with the <UNK> it should help a lot of <UNK> mothers out there i can't imagine it helping anyone since it is <UNK> a <UNK> muddled and <UNK> it's deranged
<START> in cold blood has to be <UNK> as first rate movie making even if the subject matter is about as grim as it gets in the world of make believe but film noir fans should definitely find this one a gripping piece of work based as it is on a true life crime spree br br it opens with <UNK> jones' music under the credits and <UNK> dramatic views of a highway bus heading toward kansas city effectively setting the mood of the film even before the credits end the b w photography of conrad hall does a superb job right from the start br br also clear from the start robert blake and scott wilson are natural born actors they do a great job of portraying free spirited buddies looking for the next thrill ever see a millionaire <UNK> in the electric hair hell no there are two kinds of rules in this world one for the rich and one for the poor says wilson taking a <UNK> of alcohol behind the wheel br br both are destined to cross the path of a farm family showing no mercy and leaving no witnesses behind br br blake <UNK> about movies and thinking of hunting for gold in mexico says remember bogart in <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> an ironic moment because blake himself was in the film as a little boy selling <UNK> tickets i got you <UNK> for a natural born killer wilson tells blake br br john forsythe is one of the lead detectives on the case discovering that all four family members were tied up shot in the head and one had his throat cut don't people around here lock doors asks paul stewart they will tonight is the <UNK> <UNK> br br after the murders the killers discover that there was no big fat safe in the wall like their prison <UNK> told them so in the end it was truly a stupid senseless crime the question is why did they do it and this is something the second half of the film explores in depth it takes an hour and a half into the movie before the detectives catch up with the killers and begin the <UNK> br br it's these final scenes that carry the most conviction and the most interest as the boys are told they've made numerous mistakes and left a living witness the actual events up to and including the murder are saved until the end it makes no sense blake tells forsythe mr cutter was a very nice gentleman i thought so right up until the time i cut his throat the screenplay by richard brooks is <UNK> and to the point and so is his direction br br <UNK> up brilliant depiction of two <UNK> young men on a crime spree that made no sense then or now for a mere <UNK> chilling
<START> first let me be honest i did not watch all this movie i watched the first five minutes and when i realized that i had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that i may as well fast forward and see if it got any more interesting later on it didn't this film is just a collection of lame attempts to make a story which is already uninteresting and badly told into something that it would never become a decent horror movie because i feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made this film isn't and will only put you into a deep sleep if you attempt to watch it lastly i feel it is important to say that i think this movie is in the <UNK> so if you feel that you must absolutely watch it than a <UNK> on the internet will surely show you a place where you won't need to pay to watch this pile of cinematographic dung
<START> being the first feature film with robert de niro although not released for years later this is worth the watch de <UNK> role isn't huge yet amusing as one of two friends who first try to prevent another friends marriage only to later chase him down to force him into it any die hard de niro fan will get a kick out of an early performance by arguably the best actor today

<START> i have waited a long time for someone to film a faithful version of h g <UNK> classic novel war of the worlds timothy hines has finally done it i just couldn't believe how good it was from the acting to the <UNK> the out of this world special effects i just can't say enough it was wonderful dramatic intense full of first rate performances by a top notch cast it's got to be seen to be believed i sure didn't and i've read all those negative comments by the others and can't believe what they were saying we must've been watching a different movie huh and those real bad comments by that <UNK> guy guy whoever he is well he just doesn't know what he's talking about br br keep up the good work mr hines
<START> back in <UNK> eric <UNK> made the classic t v show good times <UNK> has always been my favorite and i love watching the reruns on t v land <UNK> walker always seemed to be the star and not esther <UNK> john <UNK> most of the time felt a little jealous of <UNK> <UNK> popularity winning millions of fans time to sit and watch good times the show would have been dead if <UNK> <UNK> have been there to save it with his always <UNK> aid attitude drinking <UNK> aid was like his favorite thing on the show i was 3 when it came out and 8 when it ended instead of 1974 1979 it should have went longer like in the 1980's when i was just growing up
<START> i borrowed this movie from library think it might be delightful how wrong am i br br it is such a bad movie that i have to write something about it mira sorvino is so bad in the movie it is very painful to watch the scene with her she is a pretty girl but in this movie she is not seductive at all but i will have to witness her awkward attempt to seduce almost all the other major characters it is so ridiculous br br and the dialog of the film is so pretentious and lack the humorous fact that make then acceptable br br totally failure
<START> kenneth branagh's hamlet hits all the marks the acting is magnificent the <UNK> cinematography is gorgeous the oscar nominated costumes and sets are stunning and patrick <UNK> score also oscar nominated is sensitive and moving oh yeah the screenplay by some guy named will s isn't too bad either film critics <UNK> branagh for receiving the <UNK> fourth oscar nod for adapting the screenplay but his decision to use the full text was a <UNK> one i can't think of many better ways to make four hours fly by br br nearly every decision branagh makes works brilliantly the use of <UNK> <UNK> palace for <UNK> the <UNK> dress and the staging of to be or not to be in a hall of mirrors to name a few the casting of hollywood <UNK> such as robin williams billy crystal and jack lemmon in minor parts can be distracting but that's <UNK> the principal cast excels derek <UNK> captures the conflicted nature of <UNK> kate <UNK> <UNK> depicts <UNK> descent into madness julie christie brings passion to her portrayal of <UNK> richard <UNK> is pitch perfect as the conniving <UNK> and nicholas farrell <UNK> the potentially <UNK> role of <UNK> to the <UNK> of true friendship every speech every line every word is delivered with passion and conviction there isn't a wasted moment in the entire film the final scenes <UNK> the extent of shakespeare's tragedy in a way not possible with theatrical adaptations br br branagh's hamlet is a bold ambitious and ultimately successful attempt to match the <UNK> and poetry of shakespeare's language with equally <UNK> imagery it's arguably the greatest shakespearean adaptation ever filmed  strong praise but well deserved
<START> yes the first howling was a classic a rather good werewolf movie that i admit started slowly but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the <UNK> changed into a cute werewolf only to be <UNK> down on camera yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film oh sure they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did but they go from the little <UNK> <UNK> from the first movie to <UNK> or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something i often wonder what in the world christopher lee was doing in this movie however i read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before but still read the script before you take a role maybe you could have gotten into an american werewolf in london hell that could have been possible it was set in london after all heck werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene in fact the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking <UNK> and this one <UNK> <UNK> started bleeding
<START> the <UNK> is true girls like <UNK> ugly more than guys and the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given jersey girl goes to new york to become a song writer and after initial frustration of having no luck <UNK> some girls <UNK> about the 300 each they made last night she gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise the place is completely full of two year old <UNK> <UNK> at the sight of babes dancing br br the story is not bad and some characters are likeable especially <UNK> the fashion <UNK> part was cute and the <UNK> but let's face it the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the beginning <UNK> and her father looked far too ridiculous while they were relating throughout the movie and check out <UNK> too <UNK> on that keyboard with the break dancer br br for the first time i could think of how could the production be so terrible for a brief moment with this movie hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without any major public <UNK> without saying you were warned instead it seems <UNK> ugly has a <UNK> intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world advertising babes in a bar but showing a paper thin pursue your dream story disappointed every male teen you targeted br br and finally the music there was absolutely no break of music i found in this movie especially when it was needed the hospital scene every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened but the climax was an ultimate <UNK> an '80s like song you would expect <UNK> <UNK> to jump on the stage and jam with <UNK> heck i personally thought bon <UNK> was going to jump out with the long hair and jam too br br other than some really smart camera work with the <UNK> girls when dancing especially the wet scene and a couple cute cliches <UNK> ugly is something to be purely embarrassed about whether you watched or made it it looked like nothing but time killing or wasting depending on how you look at it
<START> honestly if anyone has a brain there's not 1 positive thing br br to say about this movie what so ever br br i lost my 1 renting this i'd rather laugh at will smith saying if you got a dream you got to protect it br br all the actors must've been bored or had no fame at the time even matthew <UNK> <UNK> however you spell it was better then all the actors in this movie when he played a psycho in texas chainsaw 4 if you see this movie and have anything good to say you iq must be extremely low with such bad taste in movies it hurts thank you and the truth has been spoken br br save yourself from the misery br br get devil's rejects now that's a classic
<START> acclaimed japanese director takashi miike can't seem to get the <UNK> moving with this <UNK> thriller an adaptation of <UNK> <UNK> book concerning an evil old woman and child <UNK> who is part of a new urban legend if your cell phone rings with a strange tone and you see the message <UNK> missed <UNK> you will replay the message only to hear your own final words before your death most successful part of the film is the <UNK> satire of reality tv cameras <UNK> on the future victims but the not so elaborate deaths which include a hidden piece of red candy are disappointing and <UNK> the frequent shots of <UNK> dead bodies are actually displayed rather <UNK> and this overall <UNK> may be the reason why the film is ultimately so <UNK> hollywood predictably jumped on the far fetched plot in 2008 yet the u s version <UNK> no better no stars from
<START> this movie is terrible terrible one of the worst movies ever i cannot even imagine <UNK> being worse that this previews made us say no but then looking for something amid the dreck out there right now we decided to go ahead and give it a shot br br stupid us br br affleck is not an actor he's an image and can look good with explosions but not even the kind bruce willis got in die hard if he stripped his shirt and ran around fighting bad guys it would be a comedy br br the best part was catherine o'hara she's always good gandolfini <UNK> again if it weren't for the sopranos he'd be washed up like he did in the mexican br br affleck <UNK> every scene and as others have said no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions br br avoid this movie at all costs
<START> this impossible tale is of a female witch pursuing a mortal man in a mortal world her community is open among it's members but she <UNK> her witchcraft from the <UNK> <UNK> this is starting to sound familiar lol it's not your typical movie very campy performances by jack lemmon and ernie <UNK> keep things from getting dull kim novak is always a pleasure on screen but i found her pairing with james stewart unusual but not fatal to the story br br with re <UNK> interest in all things <UNK> and dark this film deserves to be discovered and re discovered by old and new audiences it's still a hoot
<START> there is a word for this sort of film and that word is drivel it was drivel when it was a vhs rental and it's drivel on satellite re runs now br br it might fool you because it has 2 moderately well known names in <UNK> and <UNK> reasonable soundtrack music and nice <UNK> valley scenery br br it also has some curly haired woman who fights a lot br br if that's all you want from a movie then maybe this will keep you happy br br it's still drivel though
<START> of all movies and i'm a film graduate if that's worth anything to you this is the worst movie i have ever seen i know there are probably some worse ones out there that i just haven't seen yet but i have seen this and this is the worst a friend and i rented it one night because denise richards was on the cover talk about being young and retarded she's uncredited her role was unbelievably small how did she make it on the cover imdb doesn't even list it in her filmography this movie was so bad we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it and slipped it inside the case it read something like please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally bad movie
<START> i really enjoyed girl fight it something i could watch over and over again the acting was fantastic and i thought michelle rodriguez did a good job in the film very convincing might i say the movie is showing how women should stand up for what they want to do in life she had so much compassion and yet so much hate at the same time dealing with a ignorant dad didn't really help her much even though he loved her he was really hateful her mother died when she was younger and that also put some sadness in the role the love story was a part that i really enjoyed in the movie also i felt the passion the y had for one another then again drama sets in and then its like she is choosing between her boyfriend and her life long dream i thought it ended just right it was the kind of ending where you have to decide what happened in the future for them for all you people who likes a movie based on a sport with a good plot i <UNK> suggest that you check this one out
<START> if you haven't seen this yet i say just move on take a walk in the park don't waste your time neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money spoilers i can't decide which was worse the movie itself or <UNK> <UNK> ellen <UNK> acting talent is very questionable i hope she can improve it over time the storyline is just unbelievable loose cannon american cop fighting criminals in europe on his own infamous <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by only two <UNK> an emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang spanish police executive dumber than a sack of <UNK> give me a break there's only one good thing about this movie though at least the production costs must be lower than <UNK> 12 's which was as meaningless and over the top as this one
<START> for movie fans who have never heard of the book shirley jackson's the haunting of hill house and have never seen the 1963 robert wise production with julie harris this remake will seem pretty darn bad br br for those of us who have it is just plain awful br br bad acting what was neeson thinking goofy computer <UNK> and a further move away from jackson's story doom this remake br br do yourself a favor and rent the original movie it still effectively scares without hokey special effects the acting is professional and believable br br for readers of the book the from 1963 follows the it much closer
<START> i was <UNK> by the emotion unforgettable rendering of a wartime story which is unknown to most people the performances were <UNK> and outstanding
<START> i'm not a big fan of <UNK> <UNK> at the best of times a few have been quite good check of dream for an <UNK> but this one is just more of the same but less br br with a running time of <UNK> i expect more than 1 laugh every <UNK> the only real belly laugh are when male strangers and friends <UNK> help out lee's character br br all i can say is avoid i guarantee there is at least 10 other movies on the shelf that deserve you br br 3 of out 10 and only <UNK> i'm a big lee fan
<START> funny sexy hot there is no real plot but you <UNK> anyone br br so the naked or almost naked girls and the typical fights between college <UNK> need no development br br all in all the whole seems to be known from simply every film in this category but the <UNK> reached the goal that this film can be recognized out of thousand others br br last thing i've got to say unbelievable funny br br you've got to see it br br and if you are young and you want know more about the female body you've got to see it twice
<START> having first achieved fame with drunken master jackie chan was thrust into the spotlight once more with <UNK> project a a hugely enjoyable pirate flick which re established him as a major star by the time police story was released two years later the extraordinary hype surrounding jackie was reaching its <UNK> and crowds <UNK> to see this frenetic blend of awesome stunts brutal fight scenes and questionable comedy it broke numerous box office records and inspired a 50 rise in police <UNK> but viewed 20 years on is it any good br br as an action movie police story <UNK> stands up there are several terrific fight scenes some <UNK> that recalls the very best of chan's hero buster keaton and a compelling if over violent climactic <UNK> <UNK> performance is also very strong and whilst the frequent <UNK> into <UNK> comedy dull the film's impact just a little his charisma carries it through furthermore in presenting our hero as a borderline psychopath whose <UNK> puts others in danger jackie took a <UNK> <UNK> though in the event nobody seems to have noticed by <UNK> police story as a simple <UNK> vs <UNK> battle critics <UNK> the film's ambiguity of tone and whilst it's hardly the brothers <UNK> in depicting such <UNK> the film nevertheless represented a notable and <UNK> shift from conventional ideas br br in short this remains a quality popcorn movie though you may empty your stomach as numerous villains are thrust against or <UNK> into glass showcases in the film's final scene a potent <UNK> entertaining action movie that ranks with the best of its period
<START> some saying about 'the play is the most important <UNK> or something like that is attributed to that old <UNK> of <UNK> himself william <UNK> if it wasn't old will it may well have been our own super veteran film director mr <UNK> walsh there are a large number of his films that would support this <UNK> none are more appropriate than gentleman jim warner brothers 1942 br br the film also <UNK> up another award being named as errol <UNK> favourite of his own starring vehicles it clearly gives on screen evidence that would easily lead viewers sitting in the <UNK> theatre or viewing it on their home tv or dvd to conclude same br br to be sure the story is a semi serious biopic which takes a portion of factual material and <UNK> it with a liberal dose of the old imagination to bring us a very satisfying albeit somewhat <UNK> what biopic isn't <UNK> br br the casting is excellent as it makes good use of the natural <UNK> of our lead mr errol flynn though not a <UNK> a western or a war picture this gentleman jim is perhaps the starring role that was the best fit for the rugged australian br br errol was a member of the australian olympic boxing team in either <UNK> or 1932 his training and skills in the <UNK> <UNK> clearly in evidence throughout the film and especially in the big fight for the world's <UNK> boxing championship with the great john l sullivan himself played in expert fashion by ward bond the cast reads like a duty <UNK> of warner <UNK> resident supporting players it features alan hale as jim <UNK> father a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his two brothers are harry and george pat <UNK> and james <UNK> the two <UNK> <UNK> men of the family their <UNK> being stated as being <UNK> br br the great jack carson does his usual masterful <UNK> comic performance in support as jim <UNK> friend and fellow bank <UNK> the rest of those we can both recognize and remember are john <UNK> william <UNK> madeleine <UNK> minor watson rhys williams arthur <UNK> dorothy vaughn to name but a few br br director walsh also used a number of pro <UNK> in roles of various <UNK> hence we have ed <UNK> lewis and an unknown <UNK> are featured as the 2 <UNK> <UNK> in the opening scenes others were sammy <UNK> mike <UNK> ever hear of him and wee willie davis these guys had a powerful yet <UNK> look about them that the old <UNK> 9 <UNK> would have possessed br br we haven't forgotten leading lady <UNK> smith she is powerful in her characterization of an independent woman yet maintains enough true ability as a comic player in many of the scenes she displays quite a range in her part as poor little rich girl victoria <UNK> br br with all these ingredients at hand the trick is how to mix the elements in proper proportions to give it the <UNK> <UNK> blend well director walsh does so with a reckless abandon because he is looking for above all a great film his treatment shows all of the skills he had <UNK> to a fine <UNK> starting with his days as a player with d w griffith mr walsh seems to have a special <UNK> for that period the <UNK> mr <UNK> direction moves through the script at a fairly fast clip breaking up the exposition scenes with a humorous punch line the <UNK> are at it again hence he is able to maintain a light even humorous touch to a story which could become too drab and serious br br furthermore in an almost <UNK> element brother walsh gives us an authentic look of a san francisco of the <UNK> and as a further example of his <UNK> for that period he creates wide dynamic images of the historic prize fights there is a vibrant <UNK> mood conveyed in those boxing scenes as a <UNK> glory to this great perhaps underrated film director walsh gave the image a look as if it were an <UNK> from the police <UNK> which covered such events in those old days br br but there's just one thing to remember before viewing if it is for the first time or if your seeing it once more br br the <UNK> are at it again br br in my humble opinion as a <UNK> of both film and pro wrestling it looks like <UNK> johnson who years later was a favourite of director ed <UNK> br br a <UNK> is a somewhat <UNK> term for a vehicle for hire for local city <UNK> br br it's true mr <UNK> walsh was a griffith veteran player he was the actor to portray john <UNK> booth in the birth of a nation <UNK> br br being born in <UNK> <UNK> walsh was old enough to have his own memories of the <UNK> and of the sullivan corbett championship bout and what it meant to the sporting life in the america of those days
<START> there is some spectacular heart <UNK> beautiful photography here of a range of scenery and animals from <UNK> to <UNK> and everything in between the camera techniques are varied and spot on from close ups to <UNK> work editing is tremendous and the commentary is spot on too with just the right tone and some dramatic and telling facts about our world where the film falls down a bit is in trying to cover and <UNK> four themes <UNK> <UNK> climate change individual animal stories and hunter hunted interactions across multiple <UNK> eventually it all gets a bit <UNK> and disjointed overall well worth seeing especially given the issues covered but don't expect oscar material
<START> this is the worst movie ever made the acting the script the location everything i would have given it a little chance if there were attractive women in the movie but even they were bad you would think that a movie with the word beach in it's title would have good looking women in it wouldn't you
<START> a cheesy <UNK> awful and not in a fun way c grade movie everything shouts <UNK> from the <UNK> script bizarre premises limited <UNK> and predictable endings the turgid lighting sound and hand held <UNK> camera angles the <UNK> and <UNK> sexual <UNK> and references the <UNK> and unbelievable <UNK> to the z rate acting i saw it on dvd and kept hoping edward wood would pop out all is forgiven your worst films are works of art and more coherent than this <UNK> br br but still <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> night in my dreams i hear <UNK> are you sure the titanic crew weren't involved in this on the side
<START> <UNK> was a great movie disney made the right choice every person who i have talked to about it said they loved it everyone casted was fit for the part they had and <UNK> <UNK> really has a future with acting <UNK> weaver was perfect for the warden she was exactly how i imagined her everyone who hasn't seen it i recommend it and i guarantee you will <UNK> <UNK>
<START> like i said its a hidden surprise it well written well acted and well cast i liked everything in this movie look its hollywood all right but the <UNK> side angelina jolie is great in this and i'm totally watching every movie with her in that i can get my hands on well worth a look
<START> i hated the way ms <UNK> portrayed puerto <UNK> we are not all ghetto and we do speak spanish not puerto <UNK> i can not speak for the <UNK> persons you have run into but our language is intact our island is our pride puerto rico is better off <UNK> than any other <UNK> island i'm glad we are not like cuba <UNK> republic or <UNK> free from american influence free in true poverty not the u s standard of poverty we are not victims we are <UNK> humble honest and intelligent people our <UNK> does include strong african roots but not black roots i have nothing in common with black americans <UNK> the research br br the <UNK> between <UNK> <UNK> che <UNK> and martin l king could not be more off the mark br br <UNK> was a great hero a true revolutionary an honest man who saw a day when we would all be free br br che <UNK> helped castro create the cuba that is today is that why boat <UNK> of <UNK> risk their lives to come to america because che made such a better place for them you had a great awesome bright idea but you <UNK> it too much we have so many things to be proud of as a people don't bring shame to our people by <UNK> us i am not a <UNK> and perhaps that is why i can't share your views i am puerto <UNK> i speak spanish i am not a victim and i have been able to accomplish many of my goals in america if there is a part 2 in the future less politics more history more stories of triumph there are many br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> was okay by itself but the film felt very <UNK> and fake it also had the worst ending they were probably going for a surprise ending but all it did was leave me the question of what the whole point of the story was all other teen movies are better than this one
<START> i rented this movie about 3 years ago and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made i don't think i ever finished it it is worse than a home video made by a high school student i remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a <UNK> shirt <UNK> <UNK> and a newer <UNK> like a <UNK> <UNK> 4 or something i don't remember i don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s he might have had a cell phone too i cant remember it was just horrible i returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if i could get the hour of my life back to this day it is the worst movie i have ever seen and i have seen some pretty bad ones
<START> i saw this dvd in my friends house and thought that this was a turkish action movie with some hollywood not very big names in it interested enough i decide to give it a shot later it was a tough to bear experience believe me then after finally seeing the credits roll i <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> really suck at hollywood style film making this is an insult to the heist hostage movie genre ' but then wait i checked some names and no they were not turkish names and no this was not a turkish movie on the contrary it was literally shot in america with an american director crew that made me thinking again how on earth can you <UNK> names like micheal madsen edward <UNK> or even arnold <UNK> to take part in such a project with money probably that kept me thinking further how can you raise such amount of money to offer them and a supposedly international cast then all my <UNK> paid off and i came to find the answer by hiring the <UNK> equipment and crew that you can find and if you still have to difficulty in <UNK> your budget then by writing and directing the movie you are trying to produce or vice versa i don't have any information on that so bottom line this is not a bad movie as everybody are so anxious to present as it makes you think in my case even <UNK> and there are a lot of movies <UNK> that doesn't give even that affect this one at least makes you think it makes you wonder it leaves you with disbelief and then it makes you wonder again
<START> touching and sad movie portrays the trials and <UNK> of a writer trying to come to terms with <UNK> caused by a <UNK> accident the film centers on his relationship with his married lover whom he is often very hostile towards and his interactions with other accident victims particularly a black down and out and a white <UNK> biker the film is often humorous often sad and always believable get out the box of <UNK> and watch this on a <UNK> sunday afternoon with your partner
<START> after waking up at 3 30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep i decided that i may as well be entertained while i suffered from sleep <UNK> this movie was on hbo and i decided to watch it what a mistake br br here is the plot potential spoilers if you even care a neurotic man with an addiction to candy josh kornbluth works as a <UNK> for some ridiculous company suddenly he is offered the chance to go <UNK> which seems to be the favorite catch phrase of this movie but with a secure job and a secure <UNK> within his grasp josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he doesn't want to do it he hopelessly <UNK> several minor tasks and his <UNK> and lack of ambition fill me with contempt his inability to send several very important letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious but is merely stupid josh meets and <UNK> a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together obviously a fantasy of <UNK> in real life as such a thing would never happen a bunch of other stuff happens but it's too trite and inane to go into now br br despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy i only laughed twice during it the first time was the opening shot of josh kornbluth my initial reaction was one of <UNK> fear and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman yeah right josh kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying looking person i have ever seen in my life he is an unattractive overweight <UNK> jewish man who i am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women i do not at all sympathize with <UNK> character he is lazy and <UNK> and i just don't appreciate the failed attempts at humor skip it even if your life depends upon it
<START> certainly not horrible but definitely not good br br cry the beloved country 1995 was directed by <UNK> <UNK> and written for the screen by ronald <UNK> adapted from the 1946 novel by alan <UNK> starring james earl jones and richard harris br br the film is about pre apartheid south africa and the stories of a black man and a white man <UNK> the <UNK> but naive preacher stephen <UNK> james earl jones receives a letter from <UNK> saying that he must come immediately he later finds that his son has killed a man the rich farmer <UNK> james <UNK> richard harris finds that his son a fighter for black rights was the one killed by <UNK> son in this they connect br br i cannot compare it to the 1951 film of the same name for i have not seen it or the 1974 musical titled lost in the stars for i have also not seen it both look better than this one but cry freedom on the other hand i have seen it has a much more <UNK> air to it like it actually is trying to say something where the film cry the beloved country seems to have no idea where it is going very <UNK> <UNK> i refuse to compare the film to the novel except that i did enjoy the novel more than i enjoyed the film because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means br br frankly this movie blew well i guess it wasn't that bad five out of ten but it wasn't that good either both of the leads both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances i have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history but that can be blamed on he screenwriter ronald <UNK> who is also oddly off is game with this film having also written the sublime the <UNK> and being julia among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time there is little if any tension with any moment of the film <UNK> or <UNK> the music doesn't help the painfully misplaced and <UNK> <UNK> orchestra tracks really help with this <UNK> down of the film one upside is the cinematography with many rather good or great shots but unfortunately this does not help the film too much br br the last striking words of alan <UNK> novel are displayed in the last moments of the film it is too bad that they seem to be so <UNK> from the film that was just shown i don't know what nelson <UNK> might have seen in this film br br thanks for your time
<START> another small piece of the vast picture puzzle of the holocaust is turned face up in this <UNK> about the rosenstrasse protest in berlin an event i had not known of that began in late <UNK> 1943 the details are given in an <UNK> that follows this review br br the film narrative sets the story of this protest within another contemporary story that begins in new york city in the present here a well off non <UNK> jewish woman whose husband has just died shocks her children and others by <UNK> on an extremely <UNK> mourning ritual she goes even further demanding that her daughter's non jewish fiancé leave the house br br the <UNK> daughter hannah maria <UNK> then learns for the first time from an older cousin that during wwii in berlin her mother then 8 years old had been taken in and <UNK> by an <UNK> woman hannah drops everything goes to berlin and finds this woman lena <UNK> now 90 hannah easily <UNK> the woman to tell her story it all seems rather too pat br br the film thereafter <UNK> focusing through long flashbacks primarily on the events of 1943 that surrounded the protest in which the <UNK> central character is the same mrs <UNK> at 33 played <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> and accomplished <UNK> who is married to <UNK> martin <UNK> a jewish concert <UNK> one of the men <UNK> at the rosenstrasse site br br the narrative does briefly <UNK> back to the present from time to time and also ends in new york city once again while scenes in the present are color <UNK> the 1943 scenes are washed out strong on blue gray tones br br the quality of acting is generally quite good what we might expect given the deep <UNK> of talent in germany and the direction of <UNK> von <UNK> new german <UNK> most prominent female filmmaker herself a former actress br br the story of the protest is told simply only one feature is lacking that would have helped still text notes at the end <UNK> the eventual outcome for those people taken into custody at rosenstrasse an outcome that was as the <UNK> below makes clear incredibly positive br br rosenstrasse has not <UNK> well in the opinions of most film critics overly long needlessly layered <UNK> of gender stereotypes manipulative with music so go the usual <UNK> it is too long but i found in this film an <UNK> powerful spontaneous and entirely convincing voice of protest from the women who kept the <UNK> outside the place on rosenstrasse where their jewish relatives and others were <UNK> i found nothing flashy contemporary or manipulative in this depiction br br the very absence of extreme violence no one is shot or otherwise physically <UNK> <UNK> my tension which <UNK> <UNK> as the film progressed you keep waiting for some vicious attack to begin any minute the <UNK> of the film stayed with me afterward i <UNK> often later in the night i saw the film my mind filled with bleak <UNK> chaotic images and feelings <UNK> by the film for me that happens rarely in german and english my rating 8 10 b seen on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> if you'd like to read more of my reviews send me a message for directions to my <UNK> br br add the rosenstrasse protest swept up from their forced labor

<START> one of if not the worst film to come out of britain in the 80s br br this <UNK> tale of a middle aged <UNK> who <UNK> two teenage <UNK> who <UNK> for him and his faux posh wife has nothing to redeem it br br in turns gratuitous <UNK> <UNK> and unrealistic this film <UNK> the depths as it fails miserably in its attempts to be funny provocative intellectual and controversial br br perhaps the worst thing about this film is the way the strong cast of george <UNK> michelle holmes and <UNK> <UNK> are completely <UNK> by such a lame script it's no surprise that this was the late <UNK> <UNK> only work to make it onto the screen complete and utter rubbish on every level
<START> miss <UNK> starring debut has everything the writers could come up with from the franco <UNK> war to the us civil war the great american west san francisco in its <UNK> ballet opera vaudeville stage coach <UNK> and a chinese junk just when you thought the plot couldn't get any <UNK> it does it's magnificent taken tongue in cheek <UNK> character here called anna marie not <UNK> that's the role she dances is loosely based on the career of the notorious lola <UNK> who was the mistress of the king of <UNK> and caused a revolution when he gave her the crown <UNK> she did escape to the american west there is a town in arizona called <UNK> where she <UNK> based on the historical fact that lola <UNK> did dance the role of <UNK> there <UNK> <UNK> and the russian <UNK> who fall under her charms are not historically accurate nor i assume is the chinese wise man with the scottish accent but it is one of my favorite all time camp classics and <UNK> is <UNK> beautiful throughout
<START> my mother and i were on our way home from a trip up to the north east mainly <UNK> when we decided to take a little <UNK> a attend a film festival in boston now i don't know much about film so i thought this might be a bit educational the first movie we saw was this one the romeo division now i don't know about you but i thought this was great i'm from texas and where i come from we don't see too many motion pictures so this was a pleasant surprise my mother insisted that it was too violent but said that i didn't know much about what she was saying but this was a great picture i was shocked by the fight sequences they were great also i am a big fan when the good guys win so i was thrilled when romeo ladies killed all of the bad guys this was true brilliance i'm not sure when it's getting released on video but if you get the chance you should check it out i think you'll be pleasantly surprised a word to the wise though it is rather violent and there many <UNK> words so you may not want to let your children watch it's more for adults
<START> <UNK> which <UNK> roughly as assassination a k a <UNK> which <UNK> roughly as divine punishment showcases <UNK> <UNK> at the top of his form do not miss this one or <UNK> other classic <UNK> <UNK> is not only one of <UNK> best films it's one of the best samurai <UNK> films ever made and perhaps one of the best japanese films ever <UNK> br br be warned all of the intricate plot details in <UNK> can be a little hard to follow for those unfamiliar with 19th century japanese history even so the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers as per the norm for <UNK> <UNK> provides yet another variation on his traditional theme of loyalty to one's lord vs doing the right thing however <UNK> develops his favorite theme with such sophistication that it's really the movie to see along with <UNK> of course br br i suppose it breaks down like this if you want a simpler more action oriented tale you might want to see <UNK> however if you want a more thoughtful <UNK> albeit grim drama see this one br br ok ok essentially the historical backdrop is a massive power <UNK> between many different samurai <UNK> who are either 1 working to <UNK> yet retain the <UNK> <UNK> and 2 those who are trying to <UNK> the emperor <UNK> as the supreme <UNK> of japan of course those <UNK> working for emperor <UNK> were often less interested in <UNK> japan than in <UNK> their own clan more power in the new world order ironically the entire <UNK> system was officially <UNK> as one of the first <UNK> of the <UNK> government it's ironic twists like this <UNK> big on irony that make the entire plot all the more bittersweet br br what <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> other movies is <UNK> mature sense of cinematography every shot is <UNK> composed and much like kubrick's barry <UNK> each frame of the movie could hold its own as a still composition of course this is typical <UNK> <UNK> really stands out with stunning backdrops including as with <UNK> many riveting <UNK> just watch the opening sequence and you're hooked make no mistake this is no english period piece <UNK> is extremely violent don't say you weren't warned br br what else other than cool camera work makes <UNK> stand out the performances seem to me a bit more subtle in this one <UNK> <UNK> of zatoichi hanzo the razor fame turns in a star performance as the conflicted protagonist <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> manages to <UNK> humanity to a character that seems almost more wild animal than villain throughout the movie you're never quite sure if you're engaged or <UNK> by <UNK> character at the same time <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for respect and his later pathetic attempts at redemption seem so human that you can't help but feel empathy sympathy of course after seeing <UNK> <UNK> play the tortured hero in <UNK> it's great to see him play such a ruthless villain in <UNK> he's just perfect there's nothing more to say br br as a final note perhaps more interesting to buffs than to casual fans don't miss the last screen appearance of <UNK> <UNK> yes the <UNK> gay right wing <UNK> novelist who committed suicide by <UNK> before the crowd of <UNK> japanese military <UNK> he kidnapped in 1970 and had a movie on his life and work made by paul <UNK> who actually does a pretty solid job of portraying the honorable for an assassin <UNK> <UNK>
<START> wow i do not think i have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast justin timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a <UNK> role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that edison had br br his acting was painful to observe the story was ok and all the other characters were played by professional actors heck even ll cool j was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on how the director and movie company figured that timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehend br br his character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass and he is supposed to be the hero i would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video maybe if you have hbo and have nothing else to do at <UNK> on a saturday night and you are drunk and stoned this may be ok br br watching timberlake in this role was like watching a human <UNK> the <UNK> act in a hollywood blockbuster just didn't work at all
<START> the thing i remember most about this film is that it used to air on local <UNK> tv <UNK> 5 during every christmas season during the mid to late 70s mainly due to the fact that the true story took place on or near christmas eve it was always a bit disturbing to see the hell that this girl goes through being the lone survivor of a plane crash in the <UNK> jungle the graphic scene of this young girl pulling <UNK> out of her infected leg made quite an impression on this young viewer not quite the kind of christmas cheer i was used to seeing at the time definitely not a <UNK> bass production
<START> this movie has lot of <UNK> and thats all i could see it is painfully long and awfully directed i could see whole audience getting <UNK> and waiting for it to end run time is way over 3 <UNK> which could have been edited to less then 2 <UNK> br br transition between stories is average most people <UNK> being on <UNK> expecting something better to come out br br its funny only in <UNK> ambitious project and a below par execution govinda does a fair job anil kapoor disappointed me rest we as expected if u r expecting anything close to <UNK> or love actually then its no where close
<START> bravo morgan freeman is an actor who <UNK> a character he is selected to play before he makes a commitment freeman is a <UNK> <UNK> for this film like he was for driving miss daisy and he is not only believable but he gets a chance to change his image of playing a character with reserved dignity and <UNK> although there are no <UNK> in life for anyone this gives an actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out in order to avoid getting stereotyping and it must be said that stereotyping has <UNK> or completely ruined a significant number of acting careers br br this is a low budget film that amazingly was made in a time span of only two weeks it is a film that is well directed and written by brad <UNK> the location manager chose carson <UNK> for the film's setting and the location helps set the tone and timing for the film the editing is fair to good but a little rough br br <UNK> was the <UNK> in getting freeman to do this film while the actor was in between film projects br br there is a good chemistry between freeman and paz vega a spanish actress and this opens an effective dialog between each of the cast members who are diverse and come from different cultures the film also encourages an understanding between people who not only speak two languages english and spanish but come from two different worlds of <UNK> race gender <UNK> <UNK> beliefs <UNK> principles and values the film <UNK> for some honesty and arrives at some truth to maintain the film's integrity br br part of the comedy is that freeman plays an unemployed actor that has been out of work for four years in truth freeman is so in demand as an actor that he is constantly working br br the film offers an adventure of bonding caring sharing changing and <UNK> and the film's <UNK> give the viewer a preview of some of things an actor must go through in preparing for a role br br if necessary tell your boss that you're taking a <UNK> health <UNK> and go see this film if you're able take your significant other or your family with you i rank the film a 10 out of 10 it's enjoyable interesting informative poignant and worthwhile
<START> paul reiser did a spectacular job in writing this movie peter falk gives the performance of his life it is worthy of an academy award this was one of the most poignant and funny movies of the year <UNK> wit is fantastic and he is as good as it gets and as he was in his long running tv sitcom mad about you peter falk did a masterful job as his dad and peter who is now <UNK> years young made us laugh and cry at the same time the supporting cast was equal to the task especially the gorgeous gorgeous elizabeth <UNK> it is a must see movie for 2005 we bet that everyone across all ages and <UNK> will love this movie and somehow relate to it in one way or another we have mothers and fathers and siblings like these in the movie we have all had the good and bad times together and wish things were the same but different
<START> this film was screen as part of the 2007 sydney <UNK> <UNK> film festival i had no expectation of the film as someone else choose it for me br br i actually like films that take time to develop films that allow the characters to unfold and lets the story flow <UNK> is good but this film though was just plain slow br br credit must go to the two main actors there was a sense of tension between them as two totally different people <UNK> really come together in a very awkward way there were tender moments and sadness as we learned more about them br br i also liked the setting and the way it was shot it was claustrophobic and <UNK> and it added to the film's <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> of the characters br br i just don't understand the ending what was the point of it all
<START> it was clear right from the beginning that 9 11 would inspire about as many films as world war ii and vietnam combined however there is certainly a big danger that most of these films to come are about as good or rather bad as pearl harbor it is a great luck that the first international release about 9 11 is not a cheesy love story starring a bunch of pretty faces but a collective work of 11 directors from the entire world br br i'm not <UNK> to say that all 11 episodes are great <UNK> <UNK> for example has a needless prologue with too many cuts and <UNK> <UNK> has a really bizarre ending or that the segments are in the right order <UNK> being the only one not referring directly to the twin towers should open the film not end it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> should be the last one instead as it's the most impressive one but it is an <UNK> effort and an interesting portrayal of the way other parts of the world react to the collapse of the twin towers br br consider <UNK> <UNK> opening segment in which an <UNK> teachers tries to explain to her <UNK> what happened in new york and <UNK> suggests a one minute silence or <UNK> <UNK> part which features a bin laden double so much resembling the real one that you'll be shocked when you see him i promise in which 5 boys <UNK> about good things that can be done with the reward put out on laden br br there's a surprisingly good and extremely angry segment by ken <UNK> about a man from <UNK> talking about what he calls our <UNK> september 11 that september 11 in 1973 when their elected president <UNK> was killed and <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> with the generous help from henry <UNK> and the cia this could have become a terrible effort in anti <UNK> but it did become a sad tale and shares my recognition for the best segment with <UNK> mainly sound impressions and phone calls from the <UNK> planes to a black screen sometimes a few pictures of people falling down the <UNK> and finally a <UNK> tower ending with the screen <UNK> up and one question appearing and <UNK> <UNK> about a hysterical reporter trying <UNK> to get on air after a car bomb <UNK> in tel <UNK> hard to recognize but this one is a masterpiece of choreography br br all these different segments i haven't mentioned yet claude <UNK> about a deaf girl <UNK> <UNK> about a <UNK> of the women of <UNK> mira <UNK> strange but it takes an indian director to make the part that is probably most appealing to western tastes about a muslim family whose son is under a terrible suspicion after 9 11 and sean <UNK> with ernest <UNK> yes ernest <UNK> as a widower leading the most <UNK> life one can imagine add up to a unique film not easy to watch and hard to forget i am sure this film will be a classic known to everyone thirty years from now i hope it will be remembered for starting a long tradition of world cinema movies but alas it's far more <UNK> it will be remembered as a one film only effort and as the one of the few 9 11 movies made by then that don't <UNK> this terrible event to a love story with a happy end just to please the audience

<START> here it is the first ever episode of friends where we get introduced to control freak monica <UNK> <UNK> cox newly divorced ross <UNK> david <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lisa <UNK> unknown actor and ladies man matt le <UNK> and very sarcastic chandler bing matthew perry this is how the scene starts off until we introduced to the <UNK> and final friend <UNK> kid rachel green jennifer aniston br br the episode is better than most people give credit for like any new sitcom the first episode isn't always fantastic the acting in this episode isn't great because the cast cannot identify and <UNK> really believable in their new characters apart from <UNK> and perry who shine br br matt le <UNK> man his acting was down right dreadful because until later he gets more confident but i think he tries to be funny but at most fails br br david <UNK> why does he over <UNK> every word he cannot speak normally but he became one of the funniest characters in later seasons but he isn't confident and i cannot <UNK> with him jennifer aniston looks hot and does a good job as rachel green but we only see the real rachel later in the 1st season <UNK> cox looks quite <UNK> in this episode its worrying she looks totally different now more <UNK> she acting is a little <UNK> but <UNK> is in this 20 minute pilot lisa <UNK> and matthew perry i'm doing these two together because their comic timing and acting quality was superb and for lisa this was one of her first roles and she is so natural as <UNK> <UNK> and matthew perry is just matthew perry playing himself basically the episode quality does improve later such as the sets they looks dark and creepy in this episode and makes them seem <UNK> the acting is ok the characters gain confidence with each new scene and i am proud this is the pilot i hope we see the friends reunite cause they will always be there for us
<START> how this film <UNK> a 6 7 rating is beyond belief it deserves nothing better than a 2 0 and clearly should rank among <UNK> worst 100 films of all time national treasure is an <UNK> to the national intelligence and just yet another assault made on american audiences by hollywood critics told of plot holes you could drive a 16 <UNK> through br br i love the <UNK> for this movie being good nicholas cage is cute come on people no wonder people around the world think americans are stupid this has to be the most stupid insulting movie i have ever seen if you wanted to see an actually decent film this season consider <UNK> the <UNK> million dollar baby or <UNK> national treasure unfortunately got a lot more publicity than those terrific films i bet most of you reading this haven't even heard of them since some haven't been widely released yet br br nicholas cage is a terrific actor when he is in the right movies time after time i've seen cage waste his terrific talent in awful mind numbing films like con air the rock and face off when his talent is put to good use like in charlie <UNK> adaptation he is an incredible actor br br bottom line i'd rather feed my hand to a wood <UNK> than be subjected to this visual atrocity again

<START> a splendid example of how hollywood could and still can take a masterpiece of literary fiction and <UNK> foul it up br br in the case of the big sky writer dudley <UNK> and company <UNK> assumed they could improve upon a classic <UNK> novel by the <UNK> prize winning author a b <UNK> in so doing they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation br br the epic nature of <UNK> book and the evolution of its main character <UNK> <UNK> from a naive kentucky <UNK> into a hardened and competent survivor mountain man has been replaced with a <UNK> <UNK> farce that bears little resemblance to the author's intent in the movie version <UNK> presence is nothing except <UNK> br br intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give <UNK> novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the <UNK> <UNK> character who was an incidental minor character in the book only <UNK> a handful of pages on the other hand a very important and fascinating character dick <UNK> the veteran <UNK> is missing altogether it is also apparent that director <UNK> decided the <UNK> character in the movie played by actor <UNK> wasn't irritating enough so <UNK> <UNK> was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious voice over narration that is the hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing editing and direction br br some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based william <UNK> ben <UNK> is an excellent example but this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film <UNK> itself br br the story is dull and clichéd and the characters at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script are just shallow and boring shadows of <UNK> literary vision and unfortunately kirk <UNK> star appeal which could have helped lift this film was <UNK> by the <UNK> role he was given br br if you can believe it the film version of <UNK> <UNK> prize winning sequel the way west also starring kirk is even worse br br in my opinion the big sky further <UNK> howard <UNK> place as one of the most overrated tepid directors in the history of cinema
<START> where to start ok don't compare this film to fight club for a start ridiculous if it was even a <UNK> on fight club the violence blood gore etc would be much more evident and realistic secondly this film is no football factory which is so much more real and danny <UNK> makes nicholas <UNK> look like an embarrassment fair enough the storyline is quite decent and the fight scenes are well choreographed with a decent ending i might add but the film on the whole is poor seriously poor as people have been mentioning the accents should not spoil a film i disagree either a simple casting error or a lack of effort in <UNK> the voices caused the film to be irritating all the way through it was obvious from scene one some american <UNK> was playing the role don't get me wrong good looking guy who looks great with a skin head but no not a football <UNK> i could go on forever about how ridiculous the football scene was the <UNK> <UNK> situation also when the <UNK> are going to play united up north they go on the train expecting only 3 of them doesn't make any sense this a real <UNK> of gangsters and thugs which is portrayed in the film to be some mickey mouse cult of about 5 people in terms of accuracy did west ham and <UNK> not play for the last couple of years they have been in the championship together hmm ten years ok and i'm sure <UNK> would be able to just <UNK> into a <UNK> firm pub basically a very poor film which people will like if they have little knowledge of real football and <UNK> if you do actually love football and are intrigued by the underworld of <UNK> you will simply feel as though this film has insulted your intelligence ross george
<START> almost the entire film takes place in a public <UNK> in china there are no fancy sets explosion or glamorous people only fine writing acting and direction hollywood take note br br an estranged son returns home when he believes his father is dying he is surprised to see that dad looks fine and is going about running the family business as usual in fact he notices that his father and his retarded brother have really <UNK> a close and caring relationship and it soon becomes obvious that he is out of the loop dad is very traditional and this visiting son is from the big city and doesn't really see the value of the old <UNK> how their relationship changes and where the plot goes from there is exceptional and believable br br i was happy to see that not every chinese movie is an action picture such as those starring jet li or <UNK> tiger hidden dragon as i don't particularly care for these frenetic films the shower as well as <UNK> in a small town are two wonderful examples of good chinese films about people
<START> i'm a fan of both actors singers especially gackt and when i first discover this movie and watch the trailer i just think this is a silly one after a long waiting time i watched it at last and here's my comment br br i consider everyone knows the storyline and not going to mention about it instead of it my first applause goes to acting generally that japanese movies hasn't got brilliant and acting yet in <UNK> all cast is simply wonderful and got into it especially gackt reflects his characters emotions and changes pretty well i like many of his scenes both dramatic and humorous ones as for hyde part his acting is good but he deliberately staying in background as an actor respectively as his character do throughout the movie i didn't like some cinematography especially lighting and some colors but due to small budget it still has brilliant moments but the real jewel of the film is story it has some cheesy moments but it's ok for me and the friendship theme of the movie is really well developed and touching at sometimes on the other hand story points out a cruel world which no ones life guaranteed and with some memorable death scenes it reflects this theme to the visuals an interesting note aside this movie has some similarities with excellent vampire movie <UNK> with the vampire which is also played by the most beautiful not handsome beautiful actors of american cinema actually moon child is somehow can be seen as brother with <UNK> yet original on it's own only problem that <UNK> is it's a bit slow sometimes i'm a japanese movie fan and i used to that but it's not change <UNK> has some useless scenes or characters but all in all this movie is really good and very emotional sometimes as for actors singers duo i hope to see their other movies in future and i recommend this to everyone who likes vampire action sci fiction and romance films 8 10
<START> i don't know why this has the fans it does and i don't know why i have even given it the score i have this is preposterous there are many a giallo where one has to suspend disbelief let the picture roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor police officer has to eventually explain what we have seen but this has very little going for it and has overlong sequences where nothing happens and have no relevance to anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack even by italian standards not a giallo this is a complete <UNK> mash of horror ideas featuring <UNK> kinski in one his most blatant <UNK> <UNK> performances i <UNK> he turned up did a day's work and <UNK> off leaving mr <UNK> to get others to fill in <UNK> is of course pretty but no it is not enough and in the end we have seen far too much of her popping up all over the place long after we have completely lost interest in this mindless and pretentious <UNK> maybe i just wasn't in the right mood
<START> la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a k a case of the <UNK> tail was director sergio <UNK> follow up to the wonderful giallo <UNK> <UNK> della <UNK> <UNK> this is the quintessential giallo featuring all the aspects fans of the genre have come to know and love <UNK> plot beautiful girls black <UNK> sharp <UNK> and a bit of gore all come together to make one heck of a piece of italian exploitation br br a group of <UNK> favorites both in front of and behind the camera work to make this one of the best non <UNK> <UNK> around there's the aforementioned martino adding his touches as director giallo great <UNK> <UNK> as the writer bruno <UNK> creating the music and a host of giallo stars and <UNK> such as george hilton character actor <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> anita <UNK> br br with all this talent behind it does <UNK> deliver you bet the film works on many different levels it's a thrilling murder mystery a tense and violent horror film and a suspenseful thriller all in all one of the best <UNK> around br br martino definitely knows what fans want when it comes to <UNK> at some points in the film he almost seems to be <UNK> <UNK> in his approach for example there is a direct rip off of the scene in bird with the crystal <UNK> where the killer tries to break through the door that actually <UNK> <UNK> flick br br are there any problems with the flick hmmm only minor ones first any scenes that aren't following the murders or the budding romance between the two leads begin to bore but just before you fall asleep the killer will pop out of nowhere and you'll be right back in the swing of things br br also towards the end the twists get a little too bizarre i mean what purpose did the <UNK> <UNK> really serve if you don't play close attention to the dialogue you could easily become lost with the <UNK> <UNK> storyline br br but these minor <UNK> aside la <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a tense suspenseful classy and all around entertaining film for giallo fans seek it out
<START> i remember the original series vividly mostly due to it's unique blend of <UNK> humor and macabre subject matter kolchak was hard bitten <UNK> from the ben <UNK> school of big city <UNK> and his gritty determination and wise ass demeanor made even the most mundane episode <UNK> watchable my personal <UNK> was the spanish moss murders due to it's totally original storyline a poor troubled <UNK> youth from <UNK> <UNK> country takes part in a sleep research experiment for the purpose of dream analysis something goes inexplicably wrong and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature <UNK> the dark folk tales of his youth this <UNK> <UNK> seeks out all persons who have <UNK> the <UNK> in his conscious state and brutally <UNK> them to death kolchak <UNK> and <UNK> this horrible truth much to the <UNK> of police captain joe mad dog <UNK> wonderfully <UNK> by a grumpy <UNK> <UNK> and the head sleep <UNK> played by second city <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> understated perfection the <UNK> funny harrowing finale takes place in the chicago <UNK> system and is a series highlight kolchak never got any better timeless
<START> when i go to see a movie about <UNK> i'm not expecting oscar <UNK> performances or writing on the level of the godfather but i do expect the actors to at least not look like their <UNK> to read their cue cards and dialogue that doesn't sound like it was <UNK> out 10 minutes before the actor reads it into the camera this movie was just awful i actually got up and left about 25 minutes in and went next door and watched cold creek <UNK> that wasn't very good either but it seemed like citizen kane compared to this pile of crap on the plus side the girls were very pretty that's probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minutes in fact i left after the <UNK> one got killed there wasn't anything to hold my interest after that
<START> first let me say that notorious is an absolutely charming film very lovingly rendered of its time and subject s gretchen mol is utterly painfully convincing the very soul of the <UNK> smoothly <UNK> by ms page herself irving and paula <UNK> are richly drawn as the working class <UNK> they were having met paula at movie star news in 1990 i can say that <UNK> <UNK> performance is <UNK> and jared harris as john willie <UNK> is an <UNK> <UNK> genius anyone with an interest in the recorded history of american attitudes toward sexuality must see this movie in a theater preferably where votes made with dollars count more br br second i will allow that i am a producer of material similar to that for which the <UNK> would become famous which is no way affects my <UNK> of ms <UNK> work as the splendid piece that it is but does condition my view of notorious as an act of political resistance of the first order ms harron has crafted a work of subtle <UNK> along with v for <UNK> it is a movie about another time for our times br br few readers of this site will be aware that the government they will see <UNK> in notorious through <UNK> of the very words <UNK> in closed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a very close <UNK> of the one they live under right now while ms harron <UNK> <UNK> that she has a political agenda <UNK> to this film her <UNK> to the facts and the <UNK> and <UNK> way in which she <UNK> them <UNK> notorious with the present day the very acts that notorious portrays in loving and accurate detail are defined as obscene by the <UNK> decency act recently brought to the supreme court as a first <UNK> case and turned back there at the <UNK> of the bush administration in other words the delicate and <UNK> bondage depicted in notorious is <UNK> today by federal <UNK> in whatever hostile <UNK> they choose of course there were no <UNK> in the <UNK> or elsewhere on this matter when the <UNK> was passed of course you know nothing about it because you don't want people in <UNK> telling you what you can and cannot look at likewise people in <UNK> probably don't want me telling them what they're allowed to view of course notorious will never be <UNK> it's hollywood it's <UNK> up countless <UNK> will however continue to be <UNK> by a <UNK> <UNK> that has not advanced its aesthetic moral or <UNK> composition much in 50 years br br in addition notorious <UNK> no 18 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> statement which is <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> recently voted into law if any media contains images of <UNK> restraint it is required to make available ex warrant records of age and <UNK> of all performers notorious fails in this regard also br br in addition to being a splendid piece of entertainment and an nearly accurate historical document notorious will be the <UNK> against which the bush justice department is itself judged with respect to the <UNK> equal protection <UNK> and on perhaps several other <UNK> grounds in this regard alone a debt of <UNK> is <UNK> mary harron you'll be grateful in any case <UNK> or otherwise if you see this film
<START> the arch title doesn't fit this gentle romantic comedy donna reed and tom drake don't have much chemistry but their characters aren't supposed to both are extremely likable and attractive br br the supporting cast is a dream with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> annoying faux russian
<START> i too was fooled by the <UNK> i too fell for the gory <UNK> and the dvd <UNK> that claims <UNK> fans as every copy was pulled from shelves though it was <UNK> 6 99 it wasn't really all that worth it no scares and very limited gore the ending was very cheesy and didn't deliver the punch it should have i really don't even know how it became a video nasty with how very tame it is the story drags the characters are obvious amateur actors it doesn't live up to the promise the dvd bonus feature the interview is very strange as the director appears very incoherent and not all there the lead actress talks like she's appearing in a shakespearean production it's a great laugh
<START> i went to see fever pitch with my mom and i can say that we both loved it it wasn't the typical romantic comedy where someone is <UNK> for the other and blah blah blah you weren't waiting for the climatic first kiss or for them to finally get together it was more real because you saw them through the relationship rather than the whole movie be about them getting together people could actually relate to the film because it didn't seem like extraordinary circumstances or impossible situations it was really funny and i think it was jimmy <UNK> best performance all in all i would definitely recommend it
<START> this horrible the acting costumes production values editing the script everything about this film is as bad as it can get it looks as if it was filmed with a video camera can you give a movie a negative rating watch the ring instead
<START> <UNK> has a very interesting history which is well documented in the <UNK> section about how it came to be it seems as if destiny <UNK> to test kamal <UNK> the director while at the same time secretly <UNK> to see him complete his masterpiece br br <UNK> rides on <UNK> poetry and visual <UNK> as a result the intensity with which emotions come out achieve a dimension which may not be very real but are very effective and leave an impact on the viewer br br <UNK> <UNK> lives the tragedy of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> like her own the other stars of the film besides her are <UNK> <UNK> the music director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> background score and joseph <UNK> the d o p their music and cinematography leaves you spell bound br br <UNK> is a classic in world cinema it reveals new layers to you every time you watch it again kamal <UNK> is one of the rare <UNK> of cinema and he left us all a gift
<START> spoilers included this film surely is the best <UNK> production i've seen so far even though i still have quite a few to check out the house that <UNK> blood is a horror <UNK> anthology that contains four uncanny stories involving the <UNK> of a vicious <UNK> house in the british countryside a common mistake in productions like this is wasting too much energy on the <UNK> story that <UNK> the separate <UNK> <UNK> film wisely doesn't pay too much attention to that it simply handles about a scotland yard inspector who comes to the house to investigate the disappearance of the last tenant and like that he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before all four stories in this film are of high quality level and together they make a perfect wholesome high expectations are allowed for this film since it was entirely written by robert <UNK> yes the same <UNK> who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror <UNK> <UNK> we're also <UNK> peter <UNK> solid and very professional debut as a director br br the four stories  chapters if you will  in the house that <UNK> blood contain a good diversity in topics but they're almost equally chilling and eerie number one handles about a horror author who comes to the house along with his wife in order to find inspiration for his new book this starts out real well but after a short while his haunted and stalked by the villain of his own imagination the idea in this tale isn't exactly <UNK> it's very suspenseful and the climax is rather surprising the second story stars hammer horror legend peter cushing as a retired <UNK> still haunted by the image of an <UNK> and long lost love he <UNK> into a wax statue that looks exactly like her cushing is a joy to observe as always and  even though the topic of wax <UNK> isn't new  this story looks overall fresh and <UNK> this chapter also contains a couple of delightful shock moments and there's a constant tense atmosphere it's a terrific warm up for what is arguably the best story number 3 another legendary actor in this one as christopher lee gives away a flawless portrayal of a terrified father he's very severe and strict regarding his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world not without reason since the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo besides great acting by lee and the remarkable performance of chloe <UNK> as the spooky kid this story also has a terrific gothic atmosphere the <UNK> undertones in this story along with the creepy sound effects of thunder make this story a must for fans of authentic horror the fourth and final story in which a vain horror actor gets controlled by the vampire cloak he wears is slightly weaker then the others when it comes to tension and credibility but that the <UNK> of subtle humor more or less <UNK> that there's even a little room for parody in this story as the protagonist refers to co star christopher lee in the dracula series most memorable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous ingrid pitt the cult queen from the vampire <UNK> certainly is one of the many highlights in the <UNK> <UNK> in particular br br no doubt about <UNK> house that <UNK> blood will be greatly appreciated by classic horror fans i truly believe that with a bit of mood <UNK> <UNK> this could actually be one of the few movies that'll <UNK> you and leave a big impression intelligent and compelling horror like it should be highly recommended one extra little remark though this film may <UNK> may not under any circumstances be confused with the <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> this latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80's slasher that has got nothing in common with this film except for the title it stole
<START> this could well be the worst film i've ever seen despite what <UNK> claims this movie isn't even close to being historically accurate it starts badly and then it's all downhill from there we have hitler's father <UNK> his own bad luck on the fact that he'd married his niece they were in fact second cousins hitler's mother <UNK> called his father <UNK> uncle because <UNK> had been adopted and raised by <UNK> grandfather and brought up as his son when he was really his nephew <UNK> was much older than <UNK> and so as a child she'd got into the habit of calling <UNK> uncle br br the scene in the <UNK> where hitler is <UNK> by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers we see hitler chase the dog through the <UNK> when he catches up with the poor thing he proceeds to <UNK> it for <UNK> him in the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and <UNK> the cowardly little man but then a shell lands directly on his <UNK> and every last one we are told is killed outright how then if hitler was the only person to survive the scene did this tale of brutality and <UNK> come to be told did hitler himself go around <UNK> about it i don't think so br br next up hitler bullies and <UNK> a poor <UNK> out and war weary jewish officer into giving him an iron cross i can only assume that this jewish officer had been a <UNK> before fighting for the <UNK> and had <UNK> brought along some <UNK> <UNK> from his shop because i'm certain that iron crosses were not being handed out as shown in this comic farce br br all the grotesque clichés are here not least the <UNK> and hypnotic effect of <UNK> music upon the little man if only the producers had kept ian <UNK> on side then they might have discovered that <UNK> <UNK> merry widow was more likely to <UNK> the <UNK> boat than any flying <UNK> from the cannon of richard wagner br br hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people but how can he ever be forgiven for his appalling taste in music br br i could go on but i'd be at it for hours br br give it a miss
<START> a single mother diane keaton finds herself working several minimum <UNK> jobs when she gets fired she finds that she is unable to support her sons michael <UNK> and colin roberts the latter of whom has <UNK> then she goes to her friend and starts selling drugs soon enough she gets addicted to the drugs that she is selling her life comes crashing down especially when her kids namely her oldest son find out the truth and <UNK> to leave her then she struggles to redeem herself with the help of her kids but can she protect her family from the drug <UNK> who she worked for br br wow this lifetime movie has some of the best acting i have ever seen diane keaton overacts a lot and her character comes off as crazy but she was extremely convincing she is much better suited to drama than to comedy however the best performance in the movie comes from michael <UNK> who plays her oldest son he is perfect as the responsible son who is still young but trying to be the adult in the family his acting was especially great in the scenes where he confronts his mom about the drugs colin roberts who plays the younger son also does a great job br br a movie well worth watching especially because of the acting from michael <UNK> and diane keaton
<START> i really like <UNK> movies about <UNK> this one i saw about 2 years ago and it really fu ed my head never before seen such a sick and twisted thing the story is good and the actors do their thing very well i haven't seen the uk or japan version but i have to say that i believe that the german dvd is a bit <UNK> if you haven't seen the movie already and live in germany maybe you better look out for a dvd from the <UNK> or <UNK> the i on dvd contains a lot of very hard and nasty scenes but at the showdown i felt that something was missing about one or two very short scenes br br all in all a good perverted movie with crazy characters and a high level of violence that's what i like miike for
<START> kim <UNK> a witch on the <UNK> for a mortal lover and james stewart's her choice <UNK> comedy of manners from the broadway stage shot by james wong <UNK> in witch color and performed by a sterling cast ernie <UNK> is wonderful as the <UNK> <UNK> writer <UNK> i love this movie though few others seem to kim alone makes it a winner in my book ha my 5 film of 1958
<START> this is a cute little horror spoof comedy featuring <UNK> peterson aka elvira mistress of the dark the most infamous horror <UNK> of all time this was meant to be the pilot vehicle for elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the nbc network they filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the <UNK> babe in black but unfortunately the sit com never made it past the pilot stage due to it's sexual references this film however is very amusing elvira is the modern day <UNK> morgan and the queen of the one liners this film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal <UNK> haunted hills which was meant to be a take off of the old roger corman movies but falls flat on it's face watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience
<START> do not judge this production by the 2 hour version that was released on vhs in the us which is a choppy and incomprehensible mess i had the pleasure of watching the full length 6 hour version available on dvd from the uk and was <UNK> the deliberate pace and growing sense of menace are mesmerizing as is the amazing visual and <UNK> landscape this is an ancient rome we have never seen before and far more authentic than most br br director franco <UNK> was <UNK> celebrated for his 1968 mini series of the odyssey and this mini series is equally powerful just as <UNK> <UNK> became the <UNK> best <UNK> so <UNK> maria <UNK> may be the <UNK> best <UNK> now i am hoping someday to see <UNK> version of the <UNK> <UNK> that was broadcast on italian tv in 1971 br br i am <UNK> which version of <UNK> <UNK> is more powerful this one or the polish mini series from 2001 each has different virtues and in many ways they <UNK> one another certainly either one towers over that hollywood camp riot starring peter ustinov
<START> first things first this isn't an action movie although there is a lot of action in it i think you can compare it to american sports movies where a team of very bad players succeed in the <UNK> winning a game or <UNK> beyond expectation in this case it isn't about football or baseball but <UNK> in the beginning these street thugs seem to be good for nothing but soon we will find out that they don't want to be thugs and actually achieve something in life it is nice to see them struggle and training i was surprised how funny this movie was from start till the end you will laugh your pants off the young korean actors are very convincing go see this wonderful feel good movie
<START> as the maker of this darkness i admit we neglected 3 very important <UNK> in our end credits the <UNK> were over sights that could not be <UNK> once committed nor did the parties involved who saw the movie mention it at the time on behalf of the excellent cast and crew of the film i <UNK> them an <UNK> obviously some criticisms posted here are harsh in light of their credit being accidentally our production values were <UNK> and our special effects were quite special indeed but the plot is very strong and the cinematography by john <UNK> is superb we hope you the reader enjoy this darkness and the efforts of those who worked their <UNK> off for free thank you dylan <UNK> director
<START> wow wow wow i have never seen a non preachy documentary on <UNK> until i saw <UNK> <UNK> made in china this film has zero narration and combines <UNK> footage with sensitive interviews with four teenage workers in china who live inside a factory compound they play with toys jump rope and dance yet the majority of their days and nights consist of work work and work but the footage of their work is <UNK> and mesmerizing to watch the owner of the factory in china is amazingly open so much so that he hits home the effects of <UNK> while he <UNK> the workers <UNK> following <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from china to the carnival the film reveals how the local is connected to the global through humor and interesting compelling footage from both cultures one of the most interesting parts in this film is the cross cultural introduction of factory workers and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to each other through pictures here the film comes full circle and shows how images can be a point of communication and transformation the film is never preachy is not guilt driven and allows everyone's point of view to be present at the end we the viewers make up our own conclusions about the complexity of the film and <UNK>
<START> why this is called <UNK> is a puzzle because it's about four women three of whom aren't <UNK> except wait ah i see it's a <UNK> title and we all have to <UNK> i suppose the series itself delicious most of the characters are hell bent on cutting <UNK> <UNK> off themselves great fun reminds me of <UNK> 1976 miniseries <UNK> of <UNK> wire where every character and their <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> brady is the only actual mistress and she's getting herself in proper trouble husband is <UNK> so no chance of a baby there then but at work there's dominic played by uber sexy adam <UNK> who looks so good that there's no surprise when heavy lust breaks out dominic it turns out has no <UNK> problems i expect his <UNK> do <UNK> probably each carries a little sword and now <UNK> is inevitably pregnant that way instead what <UNK> should do is to shut up good and tight and go with it's a miracle what she actually does of course is say to her friends i have to tell my husband no you don't really you don't stop stop br br katie sarah <UNK> was a mistress once for we learn that she'd had an affair with a married man before the series started <UNK> she's now taken up with his son the father died of cancer and katie who is a doctor helped him on his journey so she's an <UNK> has had affairs with two of her patients and is sleeping with the son of the father in <UNK> ignoring the incestuous undertones it's not going to end well for katie br br jessica is an experimental lesbian she <UNK> events and she's busy doing a lesbian marriage as the series gets <UNK> she quickly gets into steamy eye <UNK> with one of the brides alex played by anna <UNK> and the script <UNK> along to a <UNK> with great <UNK> however it can't think of a good way of putting the two women in bed together so it <UNK> a very lame you're not having a <UNK> night well i can't let you get away with that i'll <UNK> one and the guests shall be me which achieves the result but isn't exactly <UNK> i thought script writers were supposed to earn their living lazy <UNK> interpretation of her character is good alex treats jessica as possibly <UNK> and <UNK> body language always points backwards when she's moving forward mind once she's over the wall in she happily goes and <UNK> for shelley <UNK> is so mouth <UNK> that so would a good <UNK> of the human race given the chance br br which brings us to <UNK> who's a widow of course there should be plain people in a community but if you're going to have a plain character then you have to <UNK> something to admire in them it's quite possible to be a <UNK> and engaging however <UNK> <UNK> looks like one of those characters that casting put <UNK> in a medieval crowd scene after the director said that's ridiculous not every single character would be pretty more <UNK> you can't find anything to admire in her nothing she's a <UNK> in a bowl of <UNK> <UNK> she does sexy from time to time i won't forget her appearance in bright red <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> into her <UNK> for a long time and for all the wrong reasons br br so good <UNK> fun all round there's easily enough material here for a second series and i hope that they do one i trust they learn one lesson though the characters never take off their <UNK> in bed having spent abandoned hours of <UNK> lust afterwards they surface still wearing their <UNK> or keep the sheets tight wound round their naughty bits after several episodes no <UNK> yet and you can go beg for a <UNK> what's this early 21st century <UNK> so production team are you listening your characters will solve some of their mental problems if they do abandon as well as talk it at least they'll have more fun in the fun scenes poor things in a series dominated by either being in the bedroom or wanted to be in the bedroom or having just been in the bedroom it's a bit silly and <UNK> a lot that the characters <UNK> in their underwear br br overall i was going to score 6 top end medium but the series does one trick that's rare enough when each episode ends you always want more and you look forward to the next one with anticipation so i score 7
<START> my kid makes better videos than this i feel ripped off of the 4 00 spent renting this thing there is no date on the video case apparently designed by <UNK> and what's even worse there's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie the only date given is 2002 leading an unsuspecting <UNK> to believe he's getting a recent film br br this movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made that i'm amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video it might be of interest to students studying the counter culture of the 1960's the anti war anti establishment tune in turn on and drop out culture but when you read the back of the video case there's no hint that that is what you're getting if you do make the mistake of renting it though it is probably best viewed while on drugs so that your mind will more closely match the <UNK> of the minds of the directors fassbinder and <UNK> regardless of your state of mind while watching it i can tell you that it doesn't get any better after the first scene so knowing that i'm sure you'll be fast asleep long before the end
<START> this was a really cool movie it just goes to prove that you don't need silly <UNK> things like continuity and scripts to make a movie it <UNK> <UNK> in seconds people get shot and nothing happens to them swords set on fire <UNK> fight on sinking <UNK> david <UNK> is the epitome of <UNK> <UNK> and john rhys davies is just the dude i enjoyed this movie but i like s t movies this is the perfect example of a very s t movie that just kicks ass if you like battlefield earth you'll love this film its <UNK> its fast its silly its <UNK> br br it also looks as if it was made in 1972
<START> i don't what that other review was talking about this definitely isn't a bimbo movie in fact i don't think there was one decent looking girl in it no it's just cheesy poorly done ed wood style science fiction schlock and it's bad i can't even begin to tell you how bad it is i saw it late at night on cable and i was in shock the fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all the actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded the special effects are a joke and the pace is insanely slow to me though the music tops it all a monkey could write a better theme with a toy <UNK> do not rent this thing but if you ever see it on cable watch it you'll be amazed at how bad a movie can be
<START> two great comedians in a great neil simon movie based on his hit play br br great combination especially when the comedians in question are matthau and burns small wonder why burns won an oscar for this he's as sharp and as funny as ever and matthau is every bit his match if a tad more <UNK> br br this is familiar simon territory two old vaudeville partners reunite for a tv special but still can't stand one another after all these years br br it's a delight to watch these two pick at each other their scenes together make this film an absolute delight myself i especially enjoyed the knock knock knock enter scene and if you're a fan of either burns or matthau you'll enjoy it too br br in fact you'll enjoy the whole movie br br ten stars put a little sunshine in your life
<START> when you look at this now and hear all the language in here it's amazing this was rated pg but that's the 1970s rating system for you peter falk <UNK> out the <UNK> name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie yet few people consider that offensive and certainly not the <UNK> who make movies nor the people who rate them br br the cast is a clue to how <UNK> this film can be falk peter boyle allen garfield warren <UNK> gena rowlands and paul sorvino aren't exactly actors you wouldn't find in the sound of music br br i like heist movies and a lot of films by director william <UNK> but this script doesn't deliver and it just has way too much of the sleazy '70s feel to it visually and <UNK> for those who loved falk in tv's columbo it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films this is far from the only case
<START> for years i thought this <UNK> service comedy was a product of john ford especially with victor mclaglen as one of the leads it certainly has the same rough house humor that ford <UNK> his films with br br to my surprise i learned it was george stevens who actually directed it still i refuse to believe that this film wasn't offered to john ford but he was probably off in <UNK> valley making <UNK> br br victor mclaglen along with cary grant and douglas fairbanks jr play three <UNK> in the indian army who have a nice buddy buddy buddy <UNK> going but the old gang is breaking up because fairbanks is engaged to marry joan fontaine not if his two pals can help it aided and <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> gunga din as played by sam <UNK> br br the <UNK> <UNK> poem served as the inspiration for this rko film about <UNK> life in the british raj the comic playing of the leads is so good that it does <UNK> the incredibly racist message of the film not that the makers were racist but this was the <UNK> of the british there at the time including our leads and gunga din shows this most effectively br br the british took india by <UNK> making deals here and there with local <UNK> under a weak <UNK> emperor who was done away with in the middle of the 19th century they ruled very little of india outright that would have been impossible their rule <UNK> on the native troops you see here note that the soldiers cannot rise above the rank of <UNK> and gunga din is considerably lower in status than that br br note here that the rebels in fact are <UNK> not <UNK> there are as many <UNK> of that religion as there are christian <UNK> and this <UNK> cult was quite real of course to those being <UNK> they might not have the same view of them as <UNK> but until india organized its independence movement until the <UNK> party came into being these people were the voice of a free india br br but however you slice it <UNK> people isn't a nice thing to do and the british had their point here also when i watch gunga din i think of star trek and the reason the prime <UNK> came into being br br cary grant got to play his real cockney self here instead of the <UNK> cary we're used to seeing fairbanks and mclaglen do very well with roles completely suited to their personalities br br best acting role in the film however is <UNK> <UNK> as the guru the head of the <UNK> cult note the fire and passion in his performance he blows everyone else off the screen when he's on br br favorite scene in gunga din is <UNK> <UNK> his troops in their mountain temple note how stevens <UNK> <UNK> the background around <UNK> until all you see are eyes and teeth like a <UNK> halloween mask haunting frightening and very effective br br it was right after the action of this film in the late <UNK> century that more and more of the british public started to question the underlying <UNK> <UNK> the raj but that's the subject of gandhi br br gunga din is still a great film entertaining and funny it should be shown with a passage to india and gandhi and you can <UNK> how the indian independence movement evolved
<START> the director tries to be quentin tarantino the screenwriters try to be <UNK> williams deborah <UNK> <UNK> tries to be faye <UNK> the late james coburn tries to be orson welles michael <UNK> tries to be gene hackman mary tyler moore tries to be faye <UNK> older version cameron diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can successfully don't ask about joanna going eric <UNK> and james <UNK> try to <UNK> their embarrassment with this crappy stuff it delivers endless meaningless dialog and very little action br br <UNK> is a town with beautiful elevator <UNK> an art <UNK> church by bruce <UNK> and a lovely <UNK> mansion by frank lloyd wright visit <UNK> don't watch this movie it doesn't do the location justice
<START> this is one of the best movies to come from bollywood in years certainly the best this year until now indian to the core the <UNK> visuals the heart pleasing dialogs and the <UNK> and soft music make the movie an exceptional one the apt depiction of <UNK> and culture makes the viewer search for his her roots in them and <UNK> the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new <UNK> on life br br this movie is for viewers who enjoy a call to their imagination and philosophical senses if you like watching movies to get all your nerves excited through on screen action sex or terror then this movie is not for you because you will find that the movie is not full of 90 degrees twists in it it is as simple a story for a movie as it can get but that's exactly where the art of the movie lies one gets a real life experience and the best thing is this experience is one full of values and hope it is about the positive side of life about the sweet things that god has <UNK> on humans as against the <UNK> movies that insist on showing <UNK> terrorists and <UNK> this is not about things and people that have gone bad it is about the goodness that still <UNK> and that keeps the world running of course every genre of movies is respectable but it takes a lot of courage and talent to come up with a movie that <UNK> against the current and tries to open the eyes of the public to the hidden realities and truths br br having said that here's more br br the movie is the journey of a couple from their engagement to their arranged marriage yes that's right it is an arranged marriage and the couple come to know each other only through their parents and learn to love each other the 6 month gap between engagement and marriage is a long time not full of <UNK> happenings but one that <UNK> the growing love and devotion of the couple to each other they learn together the importance of their relationship and of this <UNK> period of their lives and work to <UNK> the bonds of marriage but have these been <UNK> enough their relationship will face the test of not only time but also fortune will they pass this test that is what vivah is about
<START> i only rented this movie because of promises of william dafoe and robert rodriguez i assumed that upon seeing <UNK> name on the cover as an actor that this movie would be good it sounds like a movie that rodriguez would of made so if he's going to lend his name to it than it has to be good right wrong wrong wrong by far the worst editing since <UNK> hands of fate the way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore i have no idea how dafoe and rodriguez got involved in this film maybe they <UNK> somebody but they are way to good for this besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes <UNK> and rodriguez didn't even talk so if you wanna see a movie with poor editing poor acting and confusing storyline than be my guest but don't say you weren't warned
<START> live yes but not kicking br br true story some time ago a dutch tv station made an <UNK> that they were going to air a new reality show a contest rather the main <UNK> in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be <UNK> her <UNK> to one lucky person with <UNK> <UNK> failure for real br br the country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd saying it was appalling <UNK> what is this world coming to and the like in a way i had to agree br br as the months passed the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not instead of running the country br br the show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead and up to the last moment the country was up in arms the prime minister making speeches every newspaper writing about it everyone in the country holding their <UNK> and the network pushed on towards a new frontier in television and they definitely succeeded in doing just that they pushed the <UNK> br br the show aired and we all watched a <UNK> ill woman <UNK> the right candidate to receive her <UNK> so he or she would live whilst she would die shortly after br br and then in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial <UNK> the woman was not ill but all the candidates were there was no <UNK> <UNK> the whole show that with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions built up for months to a fantastic climax was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> the man who <UNK> this particular network himself died of <UNK> disease br br now this is television leaving everybody far behind in <UNK> br br don't give me a poorly acted poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a russian <UNK> show on american tv br br as if br br spoiler as if i'm going to believe they would get this through the <UNK> as if i'm going to believe this would get through the us supreme court on the basis of free expression as if i'm gonna believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on air br br it's all been done before watch running man with arnold instead at least it had a semi good ending br br spoiler this is an <UNK> bad piece of film together with a ridiculous ending so she gets shot in the end is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice don't take my word for it but i would say this leave this one alone and watch a test pattern instead you'll get more quality
<START> i find alan <UNK> review very accurate concerning the movie however i had the opportunity to rent the dvd from blockbuster with a commentary from <UNK> <UNK> motion picture <UNK> james <UNK> the then lds prophet <UNK> j grant <UNK> of the movie understanding the <UNK> from historic content for dramatic expression and <UNK> events for example the movie showed joseph smith on trial despite <UNK> <UNK> great <UNK> in defense of joseph smith he was convicted anyway then joseph was killed historically joseph smith was never convicted of anything <UNK> young was in boston when joseph smith was arrested for this particular trial joseph smith and his brother <UNK> where both killed before the trial took place
<START> from the first scene you are given clues as to what may be going on here it becomes more and more obvious as the story rolls on the acting is excellent throughout and these actors touch your soul even though i knew what was going to happen i was extremely puzzled by the motive i'm still puzzled as to why ben did what he did we could see in his face second thoughts but the ultimate sacrifice seemed to go against his emotion and feelings it was a very interesting and touching story but it left me confused maybe that was the point of the film i did like the film and <UNK> smith can <UNK> up another good film choice this guy knows how to entertain an audience
<START> it's so sad that romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and <UNK> individuals who <UNK> this kind of cheap and <UNK> shows as superficial and brutal as the <UNK> series or the <UNK> <UNK> child plays the difference is that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and other such sub <UNK> never presume to claim their shows as art <UNK> who 40 years ago made a very good movie <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> followed by another one nice enough <UNK> tries to <UNK> his film <UNK> art works but unfortunately he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression as such <UNK> <UNK> offers again a <UNK> of how not this being about its only merit
<START> why such a generic title santa claus so bland and unpredictable movies before that tried to cash in on the holiday spirit most notably <UNK> claus <UNK> the <UNK> at least was entertaining to watch because of the <UNK> to it and all the stock footage being used for some reason that seemed happy to me but this movie just <UNK> christmas in the butt and <UNK> the joy of all the kids santa lives in space his enemy is a devil named pitch santa gets help from <UNK> the magician how random is this well since it was made in mexico then some of you might understand the way of how the film was made i had to admit some of the effects were just wacky for the time it was a all out <UNK> of madness though despite all the troubles with the movie it still feels like a christmas movie good <UNK> evil and christmas still plays a part of our hearts of every good girl or boy in the world or possibly universe thanks to santa claus <UNK> the martians apparently so i think you should give it a try even if it is one of the worst holiday movies of all time though it should put a smile on your face any day
<START> i'll be honest i got this movie so i could make fun of it i mean come on hood of the living dead what other reaction could i have the thing is though the movie and its makers decided that it wasn't going to be made fun of instead it was going to try its best to be a good movie br br and you know what it came awfully close a little less cheese in the incidental music a little more <UNK> in the photography the acting the <UNK> like the props love the best buy bag well it's not a classic of the zombie movie genre but it's still a pretty neat little movie on its own and the acting writing and pacing are all surprisingly better than i would have expected there's even some decent humor as two of our leads debate how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead br br if you can overlook the low budget which leaves its <UNK> in everything alas and the almost constant profanity this can be a pretty fun time at the movies no it ain't great yes it could have been better but the makers the actors the crew they all tried to make a good film instead of a camp classic and that counts for a lot the line of campy zombie films is a mile long and thank you guys for not adding to it br br kudos to the <UNK> brothers i'd love to see what they do next and hey somebody give them a budget
<START> <UNK> two writers struggle to complete their books in an all but empty apartment house they at first help each other and then slowly the tension between them begins to build br br this is based upon a bernard <UNK> novel and unfortunately everyone speaks as though they are in that novel very little of the dialog is natural its purple and <UNK> with shades of meaning its as if a college english major with a head full of <UNK> wrote the script it's awful and i found myself instantly <UNK> to anything the film had to say which is a shame since the film is populated with great performances from top to bottom <UNK> dog on down are fine form unfortunately none of them can over come the <UNK> of the words and the premise br br i can't really recommend this movie while not really bad its very preachy and pretentious to the point of making you want to walk away i lost interest less then a third of the way in and had to struggle to get to the end if you're interested i'd try it on cable but i wouldn't lay out good money to see it
<START> there were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies but this film certainly isn't one of them it's a shame the child isn't better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes we have the idea of a vengeful child which worked so well in classic films such as the bad seed and then we have the central zombie theme which of course has been the <UNK> of many a successful horror movie the plot is basically this young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge as you do this is all well and good except for the fact that it's boring nothing happens for most of the film and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore it's not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it the film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish there's really not much i can say about the film overall as there isn't much to it the child is a dismal seventies horror flick and i certainly don't recommend it
<START> a mess of genres but it's mainly based on stephen <UNK> genre mash ups for it's inspiration there's magic kung fu college romance sports gangster action and some <UNK> melodrama for a <UNK> the production is excellent and the pacing is fast so it's easy to get past the many flaws in this film br br a baby is abandoned next to a basketball court a homeless man brings him to a shaolin monastery that's in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu <UNK> that the homeless man somehow has but can't read the old monk teaches the boy but <UNK> when he tries to master the special technique in the <UNK> the school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is <UNK> by four wacky monks the new master gets mad at the now 20 year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the <UNK> weak punches and throws him out for the night the boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a <UNK> club to play <UNK> this leads to a big fight the boy's <UNK> from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation br br al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes aside from the extreme <UNK> storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie the man who uses the boy is more <UNK> defined by the time the first third is over the plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film i'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end the effects photography and stunt work are all top notch and make up for the uninspired plot br br stephen <UNK> has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but that's not a good reason to ignore it it's quite entertaining even with a <UNK> shot ending recommended
<START> there's no romance or other side plot to this movie it's action and intrigue all the way making it a real man's kung fu movie br br an aging master <UNK> his last <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to stop his five former <UNK> who's styles represents five <UNK> animals <UNK> snake <UNK> lizard and the <UNK> despite the word <UNK> in the title none of these <UNK> uses <UNK> to kill their opponents <UNK> <UNK> told by his teacher that he's no match for the five former <UNK> must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four how <UNK> <UNK> and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story with good kung fu action spread out throughout the story br br recognized as a cult classic this movie has already established itself in the <UNK> of kung fu action movies it's known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story br br it's no artistic masterpiece with the usual bad dubbing and corny acting but the movie is one of the best of its kind because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung fu action movie of its time and gives an extra concentrated dose of them br br one movie you must watch if you are a kung fu movie fan
<START> raising victor vargas is one of those light family movies that you can watch and do the n y times <UNK> puzzle at the same time and if you want to go to the kitchen for a <UNK> and a <UNK> you don't have to pause the dvd just let it roll 'cause you won't be missing anything really important no twists turns or tension it's not really an ethnic movie it's a movie about a poor struggling immigrant family that happens to be latino they could have been any ethnic group it made very little difference i've seen it all a <UNK> times before just plug in a jewish family an italian family a black family or an irish family just the accents and names were different if the vargas family was named bush or <UNK> and were <UNK> the movie would have been a total <UNK> br br it's funny that the critics here couldn't get the locale straight some said it was spanish harlem some the <UNK> and another brooklyn as a life long new <UNK> i vote for the lower east side and it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other <UNK> they lived in an <UNK> isolated little <UNK> some interaction with non <UNK> might have created some excitement interest or tension remember west side story br br and now for the <UNK> criticized cinematography i don't know if it was my tv or what but all the <UNK> shots looked very orange to me the apt the furniture and the faces were all orange what was that supposed to mean and the apt did look pretty <UNK> to me somebody here mentioned that the old <UNK> <UNK> had very big rooms well maybe 50 years ago what <UNK> have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them br br and another annoying thing this is the second family movie i've seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy <UNK> off is this private sex act necessary for us to watch please spare me what's up with these directors br br so victor vargas is a pleasant little movie it was nice for a change to see young latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents which they did but the writers let them down giving them a flat <UNK> script to work with enjoy the show but keep your fingers near the fast forward button
<START> warning possible spoilers but not really keep reading <UNK> there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i won't have room to list them all the opening credits set the playful scene with <UNK> late 1950s cartoon stills an enchanting <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> theme which appears to be curiously uncredited but his <UNK> are <UNK> and no one else did them and with familiar cast names including kathy <UNK> a full year before she hit with sister acts 1 2 plus <UNK> <UNK> from tv's superman br br every scene is <UNK> with shallow <UNK> <UNK> at various actors actresses and producers in daytime tv <UNK> behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old fashioned delicious farce robert <UNK> penned this <UNK> spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine but feels like a gift to us in the audience some of the cliched characters are a bit dim but everyone is <UNK> with high jealousy especially against <UNK> <UNK> sally field who is the show's <UNK> award winning lead <UNK> america's sweetheart the daytime <UNK> like awards opening does introduce us to <UNK> show the sun also sets against all vain fears to the contrary <UNK> wins again she is <UNK> because it's always such a genuine thrill adam did you watch i won well <UNK> the reason for <UNK> absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot and we're instantly off on a trip with <UNK> <UNK> she cries <UNK> and <UNK> her hands though the rest of the movie while her <UNK> <UNK> kathy <UNK> constantly <UNK> after <UNK> unseen through <UNK> fog of paranoia <UNK> a taste for <UNK> faye baker for which <UNK> had been in fact specifically hired br br <UNK> <UNK> whoopi goldberg has seen it all before she is the head writer of the show and she and <UNK> have been excellent support networks to each other for 15 years so when <UNK> freaks <UNK> offers to write her off the show for six months we'll just say that maggie went to visit with the <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> has doubts i thought that the <UNK> <UNK> moved to la well then some other <UNK> <UNK> lamas come on such a <UNK> line must be rather <UNK> to still living <UNK> actor <UNK> lamas son of aforementioned <UNK> lamas d 1982 br br those who can remember the <UNK> teacher ben <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> day off 1986 as he <UNK> calls the roll <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a <UNK> writer other well hidden member of the cast include <UNK> marshall in real life mr happy days and brother of penny who gets paid 1 2 million to make the command decisions on the sun also sets he says he definitely likes <UNK> and cheap and carrie fisher as <UNK> faye sharon who's a bitch br br geoffrey anderson kevin kline is the <UNK> with a <UNK> and he is by the way dinner theater actor now rescued from his hell by david <UNK> barnes robert downey jr and brought back to the same show he was <UNK> from 20 years earlier of course this presents some logical challenges for the current <UNK> because his character rod randall was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago somehow they work out the logical difficulties and geoffrey anderson steps off the <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> can now only get worse and her trick of going across the washington bridge no longer helps first her hands shake as she tries to put on <UNK> but she soon <UNK> into a stalker unfortunately she cannot get rid of geoffrey anderson so easily <UNK> been promised development of his one man play about hamlet and he means to hold the producer to that promise i'm not going back to florida no how <UNK> geoffrey you try playing willie <UNK> in front of a bunch of old <UNK> eating <UNK> and indeed seeing <UNK> dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the <UNK> and <UNK> is hilarious back in florida in his willie <UNK> fat suit in his room geoffrey anderson used to <UNK> at being called to stage as mr <UNK> he was forced to <UNK> whatever <UNK> <UNK> across his tv with a shoe and to use <UNK> instead of the broken <UNK> channel <UNK> now he find himself as the <UNK> surgeon dating laurie craven the show's new <UNK> so he's not leaving br br beautiful elizabeth <UNK> as laurie rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well but of course the course to true love never did run smoothly montana <UNK> cathy <UNK> is getting <UNK> waiting for her star to rise and is getting desperate for some publicity br br will her plots finally succeed will <UNK> settle her nerves or will she kill <UNK> first will the producer get mr fuzzy you'll just have to watch the second half of this utterly lovable <UNK> <UNK> riot br br and you'll really have to see to believe how the short <UNK> geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the <UNK> if you are not in <UNK> with stomach <UNK> laughter and tears <UNK> down your face feel free to demand your money back for the video rental <UNK> 1991 is an <UNK> gem that you will need to see again and again because it's not often that a movie can deliver so <UNK> with so many hilarious lines this is very well crafted humor almost all of it in the writing a draw with blazing <UNK> 1974 for <UNK> <UNK> value although otherwise <UNK> watch it and <UNK> a happy source for anyone's video addiction 10 out of 10
<START> the plot certainly seemed interesting enough how can a real life brutal murder be turned into a truly boring movie well you can watch wonderland and find out br br i had heard of the wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely sadistic people unfortunately there is zero character development so we never get a chance to understand why any of this was done or get a good sense of the <UNK> between the characters the pace of the direction was very tedious this all leads to an extraordinarily boring movie br br given that dawn <UNK> a central character as <UNK> girlfriend was an associate producer and that <UNK> wife was a <UNK> on the film we should have had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters
<START> as a southern <UNK> it pains me that i must give a below average rating to an overtly christian movie there certainly aren't so many that i want to <UNK> film makers from a genre that's woefully under exploited still i must honestly say that <UNK> <UNK> joy is a typically low budget low key self <UNK> christian film the plot is predictable the acting mediocre i'm being kind and the editing atrocious as a tv movie it might have been slightly above average but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired keep trying guys you've got to have a movie about about real christians inside you somewhere might i suggest you turn to g k <UNK> or c s lewis for some inspiration
