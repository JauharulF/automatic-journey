<START> one of the things about the film that <UNK> my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene i have occasionally carried out my times of dry fly fishing having tied my own flies and being accompanied by my brother and my father we spend a day on one river or another seeking to <UNK> the ever <UNK> brown <UNK> to rise and take the fly that has been offered to them br br when we had occasions like this any differences between us disappeared and any of the <UNK> of the world <UNK> away to be replaced by the glory of being absorbed in the activity and the surroundings of the place we were in br br this was one of the amazing things that was portrayed to me in the film as the minister and his two sons norman and <UNK> carried out the ritual for there is something <UNK> about fly fishing as there is something <UNK> about so many <UNK> you can't just start casting your fishing line and hope for the best you have to <UNK> yourself to the place you are in you have to <UNK> the surface of the water considering how it is flowing and where the best point might be to place your fly and depending on your skill level you might even get your fly to land there long enough for a fish to take note of it and strike the <UNK> of fly <UNK> was directed and represented so well that they themselves can be classified as artists br br the title for the film could not be more <UNK> chosen for the river did in fact run through the life of father and two sons this film however <UNK> itself <UNK> than the family and community in montana by the the <UNK> river where the film is played out it has the capacity to draw you in to <UNK> you to capture you as the history of the family community and period is <UNK> the story told is not just a family history but a history of life what may be classified as a <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> excellent farce which of course is all it is intended to be thankfully there is neither a social or political message nor is there the slightest attempt in that direction could the plot actually take or have taken place in any particular time or location unlikely for after all this is simply merely a movie and movies spring from imagination not from reality the only goal of this movie is to entertain certainly not to <UNK> and entertain it does with reality delightfully and <UNK> tossed to the winds i think most would agree that from documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity but for entertainment i want what is nowadays described as a no <UNK> which the <UNK> game is in all respects for a few chuckles and an outright laugh now and then this is fine fare fantasy
<START> i first saw this when i was around 7 i remembered what i believed to be a vague outline of what took place turns out now 15 years later that i remembered everything with great accuracy because it seems the writers never got beyond making an outline to the story there is no plot to this movie cartoon there is no character development no back story no character <UNK> nothing the good guys do things because they are good while the bad guys do things solely because they are bad one unintentionally hilarious part is when someone who you would think to be important dies and nobody cares in the least they just <UNK> their shoulders and move on there's barely any dialogue either if you cut out the fight scenes and the running scenes you lose 70 of the movie br br watch this because you want to see some good animation and for no other reason or if you like to look at scantily clad hot cartoon chicks or scantily clad hot cartoon <UNK>
<START> oh my god what a horrible film the film has all the right people involved unfortunately it is not worth watching i saw it for free at my local library if i had paid to watch this i would be even more upset this film is unwatchable how could <UNK> be involved with such a slow paced <UNK> film no wonder it didn't get much distribution every one involved must have been ashamed i can make a better film with a dated camcorder and my big toe its beyond boring i really hated it <UNK> just lost some standing in my eyes this must be some kind of sick joke don't bother with this film if some one even hints you should watch it kill them
<START> i remember watching this film in the eighties as a teenager but i wanted to see it again because <UNK> <UNK> is now <UNK> a living as a serious actor what the hell was going on in the eighties this is a really bad film with bad taste and bad actors definitely a waste of money
<START> kill me later has an interesting initial premise a <UNK> woman <UNK> blair on the verge of jumping off the top of an office building is <UNK> a bank <UNK> max <UNK> who promises to kill her later br br the actual execution of this premise however falls flat as almost every action serves as a mere device to move the plot toward its predictable conclusion <UNK> written characters who exhibit no motive for their <UNK> compromise the quality of acting all around lack of character depth especially <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> performance whose character shawn <UNK> from being <UNK> to acting cool and ultimately comes across as a confused <UNK> this is unfortunate as under other circumstances ms blair is an appealing and capable actress br br <UNK> matters for the worse is director dana <UNK> <UNK> on using rapid cuts <UNK> special effects e g look for an unintentionally hilarious <UNK> motorcycle chase at the end and a hip soundtrack in the hopes of appealing to the short attention <UNK> of the mtv crowd certainly ms <UNK> proves that she is able to master the technical side of direction but in no way does her skill help overcome the film's inherent problems and thus the movie drags on to the end clearly <UNK> has a distinct visual style however it is perhaps better suited to music videos than to feature film br br the producers ram bergman <UNK> can be <UNK> for their ability to realize this film they were able to scare up 1 5 million to <UNK> the film secure a good cast and get domestic and foreign distribution this is no small feat for an independent film yet given the quality of the product the result is a mixed bag
<START> actually they don't but they certainly did when trying to think of a <UNK> line that adequately <UNK> how terrible this entry in the series really is there were some moments that could have been good but they are mostly <UNK> by their own <UNK> into missed opportunities and don't get me started on the bad br br the wasted opportunities are pretty obvious but i will <UNK> them here in case anyone cares anyone who hasn't seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point the first and potentially the biggest wasted opportunity was the plot with freddy's long lost child now the extreme mental illness that freddy appears to suffer and i might <UNK> to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people leave alone to this extent is <UNK> so why not a mystery type slasher in which lisa <UNK> character dreams of freddy murdering the teens only we later discover it's actually her doing all the killing sound like a good plot idea to you obviously it was above the heads of <UNK> and de <UNK> br br then there's the trip to <UNK> where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass <UNK> <UNK> enough said mass <UNK> was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much we are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would <UNK> from the grief of every <UNK> in town dying for reasons beyond one's <UNK> and control the essential problem with this plot element however is that the town is abandoned too quickly and with no real answers this collection of scenes would have been far <UNK> with ten minutes of say one sane citizen explaining to these <UNK> why the <UNK> fair looks like a horror show br br of course horror films are never noted for their character development unless they're the kind of horror films john carpenter used to direct but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die at least wes craven took the time to set up his characters in the original and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in that in a nutshell is probably the biggest problem with freddy's dead it just doesn't try at all leave alone hard enough br br on a related note i feel kind of sorry for robert englund now that he is more or less <UNK> linked with the freddy character he has played far better characters in far better productions the science fiction miniseries v for example and to be forever remembered as the man who played freddy is selling him rather short it seems he will never break the mold of horror films now as for the rest of the cast well i think their performances here speak for themselves they deserved to be <UNK> <UNK> as little more than b grade horror props even <UNK> <UNK> doesn't escape this one <UNK> as his character is one of the most <UNK> written in the history of b films br br all in all freddy's dead gets a 1 out of me i'd vote lower but the imdb doesn't allow for that <UNK> is really a testament to how a writer's inability to exploit a concept to the <UNK> extent can ruin not only a film but an entire franchise
<START> i don't see enough tv game shows to understand the attraction of show me the money but i suppose it holds some appeal for <UNK> audiences ostensibly a <UNK> show it offers contestants huge sums of money for answering a few simple questions however its <UNK> elements play only a small part in the proceedings which i find <UNK> complicated for example before answering a question a contestant <UNK> which question is to be asked by choosing from among random a b or c choices does this serve any purpose other than to slow the game down it would be a lot <UNK> simply to start with a contestants can pass on questions but must answer one of the three questions in each category br br after <UNK> to a question the contestant is then asked to lock in the answer another <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> next task is to name which woman from about a dozen go go dancers in <UNK> is to <UNK> a card that <UNK> how much the question is worth a correct answer adds the <UNK> dollar figure to the <UNK> running total a wrong answer <UNK> the same sum this time <UNK> step actually has some entertainment value as it allows the audience to get a close look at the scantily clad and uniformly gorgeous dancers meanwhile the contestant is reminded that an unlucky selection of the killer card will end the game instantly this naturally makes the contestant sweat and causes further <UNK> as the nervous contestant <UNK> the sudden loss of the hundreds of thousands of dollars my suspicion is that the possibility of sudden disaster is the show's chief audience appeal br br meanwhile the whole process is <UNK> down even more by a lot of empty banter between host william shatner and the contestant along with occasional routines by the <UNK> dancers all these <UNK> burn up so much time that it might be possible for audiences to forget what the original question is by the time the correct answer is revealed br br a typical 30 minute episode of <UNK> often gets through as many as 60 questions the first 30 minutes of <UNK> that i watched got through only six questions many of which <UNK> to other tv shows no one in his right mind would watch this show because it's fun to play along by answering the questions at home that leaves three possible reasons to watch the show br br a to see how a contestant responds to being on the verge of winning as much as one million dollars only to lose everything in one stroke br br b to look at gorgeous young women performing sexually suggestive dance routines br br c to enjoy william <UNK> <UNK> banter br br my choice is b but the women aren't on camera long enough to justify suffering through an hour of this show
<START> watching the commercials for this movie i was fairly convinced that i was going to <UNK> it for one thing it was one of those loosely based on the novel movies which usually means that the book author saw the script hated it and refused to be associated with the film worse the trailer showed only the most mundane slapstick imaginable ex kid gets <UNK> in the face with a garden <UNK> and falls over so when my little brother got it into his mind that this was the must see film of the season of course he thought the same thing about cars over the <UNK> the <UNK> bully monster house etc etc i was admittedly less than thrilled br br but once at the theater the film won me over for a variety of reasons first and foremost the writers capture <UNK> <UNK> better than just about any other children's film i've ever seen a prime example of this comes directly after the <UNK> principal accidentally eats a worm stuck in an egg <UNK> the boys do a lame over exaggerated impression of the principal <UNK> them which makes it realistic since all little kids think <UNK> that they do great mocking expressions of their adult <UNK> then one of the boys asks why did he say <UNK> <UNK> another boy responds maybe he's crazy and the entire group laughs <UNK> not an overly witty <UNK> but exactly the kind of thing a young kid would come up with on the spot and exactly the type of remark other kids his age would find hilarious as if to confirm it my kid brother laughed right on cue when they were spoken on screen i could practically hear his voice <UNK> the same exact lines if he was placed in a similar situation br br another reason the movie works is that the writers manage to work in issues like bullying sibling relationships the new kid in school and <UNK> pressure <UNK> without making any of them seem as though they were subplots for some after school special for example the bully joe isn't stereotypical he's definitely bad but not pure evil and just enough of his home life is revealed that the audience feels sympathy for him and understands his bullying origins there's also no cue the dramatic music moment where billy <UNK> <UNK> realizes what a complete tool he's being to his younger brother woody and yet by the end of the movie some type of minor transformation has been made there's some realism here in the way the characters resolve situations and in the way they relate to each other and very little of it comes across as corny br br the only <UNK> to the movie comes in the form of an absolutely laughable dance scene that even the creators of the infamous <UNK> dance party in mac and me would <UNK> at why oh why was it put into the movie did austin rogers adam pull a <UNK> culkin and refuse to take the role unless he was given a vehicle to showcase his oh so impressive dancing skills the entire sequence definitely did not need to be there and had slightly less comedic value than any given show on the history channel br br overall though this movie was excellent and the length about an hour and twenty minutes was just about perfect one of the best most realistic live action kid films you'll ever see if you're ever around children or just remember what being a kid was actually like
<START> i saw this movie in my international cinema class and was <UNK> out from get go this movie is nothing but one scene of blatant shock value after the next br br the 4th man is about an alcoholic writer named <UNK> who has visions of his in <UNK> danger he meets up with a woman named christine when giving a lecture at a local book club and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is to put it <UNK> <UNK> likes the dutch <UNK> so <UNK> <UNK> a plan to seduce <UNK> boyfriend so he can ultimately have sex with him but its later discovered that christine has had 3 previous husbands who she all murdered now <UNK> and <UNK> boyfriend could be the 4th man the storyline makes sense with no plot holes the editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine the movie is just gross and i felt the need to vomit in some parts basically this isn't my cup of tea br br the movie opens with <UNK> getting out of bed in just a t shirt so in the very beginning you get to see <UNK> lovely pecker <UNK> around as he walks around his <UNK> apartment in a <UNK> state later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of <UNK> and they do show it along with the blood <UNK> that ensues <UNK> <UNK> a statue of jesus and has homosexual sex in a <UNK> plus there's a lot of blood more blood than all the freddy krueger movies combined br br not that i have anything against shocking scenes but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking the whole movie is <UNK> around the shock value br br so if any of this is your cup of tea watch this movie otherwise stay far far far far far away from this one my mind is still <UNK>
<START> wow what can i say about this film it's a lousy piece of crap i'm surprised that it got rated as high as it did what's wrong with this film here's a better question what's not wrong with this film br br the story itself is just crap and cliché here's pretty much what it's about some kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on gets killed and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge all of that is packed into <UNK> minutes of worthless film if you haven't seen this movie don't waste your time watching it also the second one isn't much better so don't bother watching that either i rated this movie a three because i liked the <UNK> outfit not because there was anything good about the movie i think you get the picture
<START> much to your <UNK> happiness fair readers cage and hopper did meet and fortunately not in a lynch <UNK> red rock west is way better than any lynch movie  nicolas cage is a <UNK> actor the <UNK> babe is a surrogate femme fatal only daddy hopper is as mean as ever  red rock west is despite the trite cast one of my favorite american thrillers in a word a thriller with some twists br br one notices mainly the gusto the awesome pace the thrills the nice suspense lara flynn <UNK> cute tight small ass <UNK> <UNK> physical shape though undeniably ugly with sharp bird features thick <UNK> and thin rare hair cage displayed a fine overall shape  <UNK> <UNK> routine some moderately but truly funny moments <UNK> play with his intended persona <UNK> rigid <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cage seems a <UNK> the <UNK> gloomy <UNK> of the noir cinema hungry tough if needed naive dirty tired lara flynn boyle performs as the cold mean <UNK> walsh as her heartless husband and hopper as the <UNK> hit man he's already done before br br cage looks indeed rather <UNK> or <UNK> or very confused and having a severe <UNK> but this might be his regular look
<START> when robot <UNK> start attacking major cities who will stop the madman behind the attacks sky captain jude law plays joe sullivan the ace of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> odds along with his <UNK> reporter ex girlfriend polly <UNK> gwyneth paltrow and former flight partner captain <UNK> cook angelina jolie br br sky captain and the world of tomorrow may look and feel like an exciting movie but it really is quite dull and <UNK> the film's running time is <UNK> minutes yet it feels so much longer because there is no substance in this movie the visuals were great and the film did a nice job on that however there is nothing to support these wonderful visuals the film lacks a story and interesting characters making the while thing quite dull and unnecessary i blame director and writer <UNK> <UNK> he focuses too much on the visuals and spent little time on the actual story the movie is like a girl with no personality after awhile it kind of gets bland and <UNK> sky captain represents a beautiful girl with no personality it's simply just another case of style over substance br br the acting is surprisingly average and that's not really their fault since they had very little to work with the main reason i watched this movie is because of angelina jolie however the advertising is quite misleading and she is only in the film for about 30 minutes her performance is surprisingly bland as well jude law gives an okay performance though you would expect a lot more from him gwyneth paltrow was just average nothing special at all <UNK> <UNK> performance was the only one i really liked she gives a pretty good performance as the mysterious woman and she was the only interesting character in the entire film br br the movie is not a complete bust though there were some wow and exciting scenes there just weren't enough of them the film just doesn't have that hook to really make it memorable it was actually quite bland and it wasn't very engaging at all it's too bad the film wasn't very good since it had such a promising premise in the end sky captain is surprisingly below average and not really worth watching rating 4 10
<START> michael <UNK> plays mike a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality he has no problem <UNK> naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that's when he loses it he believes that when women actually have sex that's when they lose any sense of innocence and or beauty so he <UNK> through the hollywood hills stalking <UNK> couples at a distance ultimately shooting the men dead with a high powered rifle with a scope br br the seeming primary reason for this movie's existence is to <UNK> in sexual activity over and over again the story comes off as more of an <UNK> this is bound to make many a happily <UNK> male quite pleased as we're treated to enough <UNK> scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of <UNK> of course seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the <UNK> towards <UNK> for one thing mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger this is all <UNK> by awfully <UNK> if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack br br those with a <UNK> for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another it even includes one lesbian <UNK> that <UNK> mike and <UNK> him uncertain how to react it unfolds at a very slow pace but <UNK> up with a most amusing ironic twist it's a kinky and twisted <UNK> that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen br br 7 10
<START> as the front cover says the hamlet of our time for our time br br i had to study this filmed version of hamlet directly after watching <UNK> branagh's version and it was truly a disappointing experience br br this version takes a different approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality one very very homosexual <UNK> and an interesting interaction between hamlet and <UNK> i think for the time 60's this was a very well done version of hamlet but cannot compare to branagh's complete version br br just a note i found the video at my local video store in australia and i'm actually looking for a <UNK> branagh dvd to buy if such a thing even exists if anyone knows of one please tell me
<START> i don't pretend to be an authority on actors who have played othello but i've never witnessed a performance of the play on film or on stage <UNK> othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity br br according to the <UNK> notes fishburne never received any professional training as an actor perhaps this explains why his acting in this beautifully edited film comes over as so believable and so powerful instead of chewing the scenery in the <UNK> fashion for such high powered roles <UNK> portrayal is focused more on <UNK> love for his wife and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal than on violence and vengeance in a word the performance is understated and made far more impressive by <UNK> extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been br br the acting throughout is superb and the <UNK> speeches gain grace from their light editing even <UNK> after all can be improved upon now and again and if that be <UNK> make the most of it
<START> birthday girl doesn't know what it wants to be is it a comedy is it a drama it just doesn't know what could have been a very funny or touching film ends up in no man's land the premise is original enough to have <UNK> a script full of interesting scenarios but hardly delivers any and ends up <UNK> out this is a real shame if you look at the cast it's very solid all the way through but they don't get the chance to shine very disappointing
<START> i don't know who wrote the script for this movie but from the first moment on i was irritated of all possible decisions they could make up in the mountains why do they make the decision which is the most dangerous of all why do the criminals act dumb although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it why doesn't the main criminal land the helicopter shoot stallone grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage and there are more cases of illogical behavior i'd give this movie 5 points for nice action and great landscape scenery but due to the illogical behavior of the characters i just can give this movie 1 point
<START> my introduction into <UNK> <UNK> cinematic world is through his famed and recent samurai trilogy with the twilight samurai the hidden blade and love and honor i had enjoyed all three films and looking at the prolific veteran director's filmography i think it'll take me a very long while to watch all his films especially the <UNK> san series needless to say when <UNK> our mother has finally reached our <UNK> i jumped at the chance to watch what would be an <UNK> to mothers everywhere celebrating their <UNK> love for their children br br based on the autobiography of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> our mother tells of a close <UNK> family of four  mother <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> father <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> daughter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and youngest child <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the get go their lives would be changed forever when <UNK> gets arrested under the peace <UNK> law for his morally controversial <UNK> against the nation set in the late 30s where japan had begun their <UNK> in china and thereafter their participation in wwii br br so begins <UNK> struggle to hold down jobs to feed her family and the frequent difficult <UNK> with her husband behind bars help comes from relatives especially on <UNK> side since <UNK> own dad had adopted an i told you so attitude with her choice of <UNK> <UNK> one time student <UNK> <UNK> buffs should recognize <UNK> <UNK> here provides laughter as a bumbling man who slowly becomes <UNK> and surrogate guardian to the children and <UNK> sister in law <UNK> <UNK> dan from <UNK> which i believe would have sounded some <UNK> alarm <UNK> as to her unfortunate fate as the film progresses through its <UNK> br br while the film centers primarily on how the kids are growing up under the presence of their mom and in a distant relationship with their dad what i enjoyed is how the <UNK> family events unfold under the <UNK> worldwide events that have <UNK> on the common folk in japan it's against the historical backdrop of <UNK> push to <UNK> <UNK> and there are characters here that don't mask those ambitions even discussing what the country would eventually do should it be successful in holding onto <UNK> lands this is something i rarely see in japanese films being that frank in their discussion of that era and also to get a glimpse of how the common man have to struggle against domestic issues made all the more difficult with resources <UNK> toward the war effort br br the actresses casted here are pitch perfect in their delivery and roles be they the veterans or the child actors actress <UNK> <UNK> deserves special mention for her role as the <UNK> figure who has to dig deep and find that inner strength to carry the household through under trying circumstances while <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are lovable as the understanding children who have to learn to make do and compromise each scene with the three of them together just makes it heart wrenching when the going gets tough or fill your heart with joy should they be celebrating before long you'll soon find yourself being attracted to want to be part of this family thanks to the primary <UNK> powerful performances with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> some really natural performances from the kids br br <UNK> our mother boasts some stunningly beautiful art direction and is classy in its delivery of both happy and sad moments without going over the top or relying on cheap melodrama to <UNK> the emotions it seeks from the audience there are plenty of little things here done right which makes it pitch perfect with every scene not being wasted and with every nuance very meaningful in conveying its message across be it compassion or love br br aside from the very abrupt ending i had hoped that it could have continued for a lot more despite its more than 2 hours runtime <UNK> our mother comes highly recommended and you'll find it difficult to be holding back either your tears or that thought about your own mom and her sacrifices she makes for you on an everyday basis just what those sacrifices are should you need another reminder then the scene during the end credits roll will remind you of the stuff that you'd probably have taken for granted
<START> suppose you've been on a deserted island the last ten years haven't heard of scream and left when halloween part 1 entered the cinema then this movie would have been a blast and a completely new vision on the horror scene br br at the moment a 2 7 rating is on imdb and it doesn't deserve a that low appreciation <UNK> all the way like i know what you did and a who is it that when getting to the end convinced me of that who and why br br no big surprise just a nice flick to watch with a <UNK> popcorn and no urge to get a difficult plot deep characters if the video rental is out of the top titles you can take it without a risk but don't expect a <UNK> i've seen a lot worse

<START> i honestly had somewhat high expectations when i first began to watch this movie but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring films i have ever seen br br first of all the pace is incredibly slow so it seems much longer than it is and it's not short i'm sure when jane austen wrote the book she made it several pages long filled it with description and didn't intend for people to read in in one day or it might drag and lose it's appeal which emma most certainly did now sense and sensibility had this flaw of a slow pace but at least it had lively lines to make up for it as well as some good performances br br that brings me to flaw 2 which is of course the acting while i don't happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film i am sure they are capable of good work but i didn't see much of it in this movie it was like people were trying too hard to be witty too hard to be upper class too hard to be british well some of them so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people br br 3 the cast as i said seemed only like actors and not actually like the people they were playing maybe that's a good thing because the people they played really weren't all that nice why did everybody like emma for example sure she was nice to the rich handsome people in front of them but she was an awful <UNK> behind their backs if her friends were ugly then she didn't even bother to go behind their backs so why is this girl so great why do people have to tell stories just to make her laugh of course the <UNK> couldn't even do that right i have enough problems with gwyneth paltrow as gwyneth paltrow and her emma did not exactly change my opinion br br well it's easy to see that i did not care for this one i'm sure it's a lovely book and all but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen and emma is one of them
<START> i consider this film to be the best one about mike hammer with <UNK> <UNK> performance the definitive mike hammer harry <UNK> script is excellent and contains many <UNK> on mickey <UNK> novel his direction is strong and imaginative and he makes fine use of light and shadow the camera work by john <UNK> is top notch as is the score by <UNK> <UNK> the cast includes many veteran players as well as <UNK> castle in her memorable performance as charlotte <UNK> all in all this is one of the finest private eye films ever made <UNK> elliott and <UNK> <UNK> should have received more opportunities i have always <UNK> this film
<START> yes a true classic this is what british drama is all about realism and the minimal use of special effects and over <UNK> budgets i last saw this drama when it was last screened on british <UNK> tv in 1994 it truly should be viewed by everyone who likes a scary plot no big names but non the less great acting sadly the <UNK> is now owned by someone unknown and as such this great drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon i myself recently acquired the woman in black on vhs so now once again i shall be able to enjoy this truly great british drama you should try and enjoy it too br br mark r <UNK>
<START> it isn't always easy to explain what a movie is like but this time i think i've found it it reminded me of two movies <UNK> small time criminals <UNK> some drugs and doing some stupid things in <UNK> and the blair witch project because of the style of filming br br it's about the loyalty between two friends one of them is coming out of jail the other one hasn't been caught yet with a stolen vehicle they drive through the scottish countryside but than run out of <UNK> as they try to find some fuel they find a farm in the middle of nowhere the farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them than it all goes wrong one of the friends accidentally shoots the <UNK> daughter and they have to run what follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of <UNK> the two friends literally have to run for their lives br br apparently this movie was shot in only 12 days time ok that's not exactly unbelievable because the biggest part of it is always in the same place the scottish countryside but i still find that quite amazing especially because this isn't actually a bad movie it's perhaps not the greatest movie ever but they still can be proud of what they achieved i had a nice time watching it and overall i enjoyed the movie i give it a 7 10
<START> no redeeming qualities can possibly be expressed i wish i could get my time back nice skull face broad really smiles bright at the camera when the disease has already <UNK> enough havoc on the ill informed script i was spoiler happy to see all the characters dead or severely <UNK> by the end especially the party <UNK> that drink the <UNK> juice on their way to the alleged sunset eli roth does shine for moments of maybe ten putting forth the theory on how well <UNK> <UNK> in the woods when others really fiend on top of beer <UNK> overall i found most of it pointless though not without gratuitous violence and not enough nudity happy to witness the demise of cast in a way though wishing that journey never happened probably should've been getting laid instead of watching <UNK> late night ugh
<START> the ring was made from the only screenplay hitchcock wrote himself and it deals as many of his earliest pictures do with a love triangle at first glance it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelity themed morality comedies of cecil b de <UNK> but more than that it is the first really competent hitchcock picture even if he was not yet using the ideas and <UNK> of suspenseful thrillers he was at least developing the tools with which to create suspense br br as well as being a student of the german <UNK> style the <UNK> editing style of <UNK> <UNK> had had its impact upon hitchcock but here he keeps <UNK> not just with the edits but with the content of the imagery this is apparent from the opening shots where spinning <UNK> rides brilliantly establish a smooth <UNK> and like <UNK> the editing style seems to suggest sound  for example when a split second shot of the bell being <UNK> is <UNK> in we almost <UNK> hear the sound because the image is so jarring br br there is also a contrast particularly with silent films from the us in that the ring is not <UNK> up with too many title cards as much as possible is conveyed by imagery and <UNK> has enough faith in the audience to either lip read or at least <UNK> the meaning of the bulk of the characters' speech and it's not done by contrived symbolism or overacting it's all done by getting the right angles and the right timing particularly with point of view shots as well as some strong yet subtle performances there are unfortunately a few too many obvious <UNK> devices particularly double <UNK> many of which were unnecessary but there is far less of this than there is in the <UNK> br br let's make a few <UNK> mentions for the aforementioned actors first up the stunningly handsome and very talented carl <UNK> in the lead role in spite of his talent i was at first a bit confused as to why he got the role as to be honest he looks more like a ballet dancer than a <UNK> but that just goes to show how much i know as it turns out <UNK> was in fact a former professional boxer and inexperienced in acting playing his rival is the competent ian hunter who would go on to have a lengthy career in supporting roles right up to the 60s the most demanding role in the ring has to be that given to <UNK> hall davis torn between two lovers she pulls it off very well however with an <UNK> understated performance and it's a shame her career never lasted in the sound era and last but not least the great gordon <UNK> provides some comic relief in what is probably his best ever role br br the <UNK> climactic fight scene is among the most impressive moments of silent era hitchcock martin <UNK> may have had his eye on the ring when he directed the fight scenes in raging bull as his <UNK> for these scenes was stay inside the ring the fight in the ring starts off with some fairly regular long shots but when the action <UNK> hitchcock drops us right in the middle of it with close ups and point of view shots hitchcock's aim always seems to have been to involve his audience and this was crucial in his later career where the secret of his success was often in <UNK> the viewer in the character's fear or paranoia br br the ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known the <UNK> it's a much more polished and professional work than the earlier picture and probably the best of all his silent features
<START> strangely erotic schlock gothic horror that will be loved by hammer house of horror fans the world over appears to be an interesting take on beauty and the beast it is definitely worth a look and surprisingly well acted when taking into consideration the genre and era br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> horses <UNK> faux fur monsters in the woods proof that no one had a brazilian in the 70's and more <UNK> <UNK> than you can shake a stick at what more could you possibly want br br it certainly <UNK> my sunday afternoon
<START> bizarre take on the cinderella tale terribly poor script but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil step mother performance br br visually stunning in some parts but that's about it the period costumes range from the <UNK> era to the 1990s fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivel br br if you're really in the mood for a cinderella story i suggest ever after a cinderella story or the glass <UNK>
<START> this murder mystery with musical numbers is long on atmosphere and character but rather short on suspense and <UNK> based on a stage play by broadway <UNK> earl <UNK> and others it combines a <UNK> plot with a <UNK> ambiance a homicide investigation takes place on opening night at the theatre where a musical <UNK> is being staged br br the cast is impressive and varied tough goofy victor mclaglen as the police officer who leads the investigation and never fails to <UNK> <UNK> at whatever <UNK> happens to be in sight jack <UNK> the <UNK> jack lemmon  or was jack lemmon the <UNK> jack <UNK> as the <UNK> director who must <UNK> the staged performance as well as the chaos behind the scenes the ever <UNK> jessie ralph as a wardrobe mistress with deep dark secrets dorothy <UNK> who has a stunning close up monologue near the end as the <UNK> maid <UNK> in love with the male lead carl <UNK> the danish star as that very male lead <UNK> the classic <UNK> for two not once but twice kitty <UNK> <UNK> delivering where do they come from and where do they go and other <UNK> <UNK> songs the glorious <UNK> michael who <UNK> from us too soon as a mean spirited <UNK> whose love for <UNK> is <UNK> the usually ridiculous toby wing who here at least is the center of a laugh getting running joke br br when the plot complications get out of hand there is always an interesting performer or fun and <UNK> musical number to distract the viewer the film's most celebrated sequence is the <UNK> number led by michaels but aside from its controversial history it's really one of the lesser musical offerings all of the songs here are staged as if they could actually have fit into a standard <UNK> theatre space as opposed to the cinematic fantasy setup of the busby berkeley style
<START> i was able to hang in for only the first twenty minutes of this low budget movie the most glaring absurdity was that while the american inmates in a north korean <UNK> camp are all supposedly suffering from severe <UNK> of food and medicine going without bathing <UNK> in flimsy and filthy <UNK> and sleeping on bare floors and let's not forget enduring torture they always manage to sport <UNK> <UNK> hair with the exception of a suitably <UNK> looking harry morgan as an army major the casting and acting are simply awful ronald <UNK> cannot seem to stick to portraying a single character and instead creates a rather <UNK> <UNK> of past roles a mostly <UNK> cast portraying the north korean camp officers might have been forgivable but when supposedly russian officers acting as <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> around wearing re <UNK> nazi uniforms complete with <UNK> and <UNK> obvious costume department <UNK> from wwii flicks and speaking with accents like general <UNK> from <UNK> heroes well that's just six kinds of silly don't waste your time on this one

<START> <UNK> or club p should really be called <UNK> for lame every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much hyped <UNK> <UNK> lesbians fighting monsters rather this is the tale of a <UNK> country girl who's grandmother has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few odd but specific rules don't walk under a <UNK> don't eat raw meat and don't accept money for your powers well guess what folks the girl moves to <UNK> to raise some money as a <UNK> <UNK> and manages to break all the rules <UNK> taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the <UNK> <UNK> who pay for her services br br while this film can't even be released in thailand due to it's controversial subject matter most american audiences will find this ho hum horror <UNK> a cross between <UNK> and interview with the vampire as directed by walt disney br br if not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the mpaa could probably rate this for pre teens only there is literally broadcast tv adult fare although you'd expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a <UNK> and one of the actresses is a <UNK> porn star in real life br br as for the <UNK> angle there's one brief <UNK> and a couple of i love <UNK> to prove that the two main stars really are a couple on brother and the p bar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their <UNK> on and do carnival stunts there's a <UNK> who cuts <UNK> out of a girl's mouth <UNK> <UNK> imagery br br no nudity no real monster unless you count a five foot high <UNK> spirit with yellow eyes and no way any adult should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on dvd you've been warned
<START> at the academy awards ceremony on march 27 1957 dorothy malone won the best supporting actress oscar for her <UNK> over the top portrayal of a spoiled <UNK> of a texas oil <UNK> in written on the wind the 1956 <UNK> adapted from robert <UNK> novel was a <UNK> three ring circus <UNK> alcoholism greed <UNK> and <UNK> br br <UNK> performance as <UNK> hadley a lonely rich girl who picks up men to <UNK> the pain of <UNK> from a former childhood sweetheart was representative of the movie as a whole mesmerizing to watch even as it <UNK> to the lowest common <UNK> melodrama written on the wind is ultimately the work of one man the incredibly gifted director douglas sirk an <UNK> from pre world war 2 <UNK> germany who left his european theater <UNK> behind to pursue a career in hollywood br br an extremely <UNK> man sirk made a name for himself in the 1950's as universal <UNK> reliable director of lavish soap operas most notably with ross <UNK> productions of magnificent obsession all that heaven allows and imitation of life independent producer albert <UNK> offered sirk the opportunity to work outside the <UNK> constraints of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and create a more adult sensational product hence the <UNK> wind and its follow up <UNK> <UNK> angels both released under the universal international <UNK> it's anyone's guess why sirk didn't pursue <UNK> themes but apparently directing these exaggerated dramas <UNK> more to his artistic sensibilities written on the wind could be considered <UNK> epic soap opera indeed it is so <UNK> with human vulnerability and <UNK> as depicted among the very rich that it is as compelling to watch as any real life domestic <UNK> among the rich and famous perhaps more so robert stack not an actor typically known for over <UNK> nearly matches malone in intensity with his offering of the weak <UNK> brother kyle hadley a mere shadow of his <UNK> father when he finds out that he is unable to <UNK> his new bride a beautifully <UNK> lauren bacall hadley goes off the deep end <UNK> an already serious drinking problem with a secret gun fetish that threatens to make him a human time bomb both brother and sister as <UNK> and unlikeable as they are are presented as victims of their past giving them a human quality that makes them seem less monstrous and far more interesting than the <UNK> side of the family mainly bacall and the <UNK> handsome rock hudson young <UNK> old <UNK> friend and business associate a surrogate son to the old man and <UNK> s <UNK> object of desire despite all the domestic co <UNK> on display it's not so much the story that is memorable here as the way it is filmed with a real <UNK> for <UNK> composition and editing director sirk draws his audience into this picture with the most <UNK> technicolor cinematography imaginable every single shot in this film is an eye filling <UNK> of <UNK> colors from the sight of a tank like pink <UNK> pulling up to an enormous <UNK> front doors to the <UNK> <UNK> of a luxury miami hotel a spectrum of <UNK> almost <UNK> in their diversity action and dramatic scenes feature <UNK> <UNK> use of <UNK> camera angles shadowy lighting and cross cut editing shown to greatest effect in the scene where a rebellious drunken malone dances <UNK> in her upstairs bedroom to the loud <UNK> of a record player while her stricken father <UNK> <UNK> the huge <UNK> the scene is so riveting that you swear you are experiencing a great <UNK> drama unfold what you're really watching is trash of an enormously entertaining kind <UNK> up in lurid technicolor and polished to perfection by a visual genius
<START> lee <UNK> the 100 years of horror for ted <UNK> and was talking about <UNK> werewolves he said something to the effect that his only brush with <UNK> was the howling ii then he <UNK> the less said about that the better indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire <UNK> of screen performances the first howling by joe <UNK> was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter it was a film to be taken seriously like other good original films filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first time see <UNK> then <UNK> ii to illustrate this point this film is miles and miles away from the first on every front there is absolutely nothing scary about it it looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning okay i'll <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> too lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous things check out that ending with him and <UNK> lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave america to go to romania the story isn't really worth <UNK> here and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have stephen parsons and his band <UNK> play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise <UNK> <UNK> is here and yes she <UNK> once and then we get that scene showed again and again and again one reviewer said 17 times i counted ten but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point i gave the film three stars but it really deserves a zero the three i gave it are 1 for lee and two for ms <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> ok i admit i think kenny <UNK> looks amazing in this movie but beyond his good looks the movie is carried by a sometimes predictable but reasonable plot br br starting out we're introduced to the three lead females of the movie one a <UNK> very concerned about her image and never married a police officer with child and a bad ex to go on about the third a power status hungry doctor with a desire for recognition and three <UNK> br br they are almost the first wives club and indeed there is much verbal bashing of <UNK> involved as well as some he left the credit card behaviour characters set the movie continues br br <UNK> character the <UNK> arrives late at a funeral where a young <UNK> filling in for the regular player <UNK> catches her eye what will her two friends say about the ensuing <UNK> will they live happily ever after br br a <UNK> or two recommended if you're the <UNK> type the end uplifting but maybe not what you'd expect all in all a great movie which stands out amongst the current choices of action special effects and schlock horror
<START> ben stiller doesn't so much act as react and he does it very well he is very <UNK> on the comedy going on around him in there's something about mary the stand up hair scene only works because of stiller trying to keep a straight face when he confronts <UNK> other two <UNK> he is the <UNK> guy in the room but the scene is hilarious br br in along came polly the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to <UNK> stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent hank <UNK> and philip seymour hoffman get the best lines of which there are too few having said that hoffman relies a little too much on <UNK> humour you know we are in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh a basketball scene where hoffman <UNK> it up is completely <UNK> though it throws up one <UNK> in the form of a <UNK> <UNK> that does raise a smile <UNK> through <UNK> reaction however everyone seems to be acting in a bubble there is very little reaction hoffman and <UNK> characters could have played off each other much much more aniston again <UNK> her <UNK> role but stiller is no ross it is more of a joey with a crush on <UNK> scenario br br polly is a by the numbers <UNK> com and that is its failing it lacks heart you don't root for the characters with a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story but in the end the film's failure comes down to poor writing worth watching if it pops up on tv on a slow night but you'll regret <UNK> out cash to see it
<START> on paper this movie would sound incredibly boring the idea of a 75 year old man traveling the country side on a riding <UNK> certainly doesn't have much appeal to it but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than the straight story br br the perfect example of this is a scene in which alvin meets a runaway teenage girl she's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out alvin tells her a story about his own kids long ago he had them each take a stick and break it which they could easily do then he had them <UNK> the sticks and try to break them that <UNK> he said is family so many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger the straight story realizes that we're smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions br br <UNK> journey across <UNK> is full of such <UNK> un hollywood character interactions each interaction is full of warmth and humor and alvin is so cute riding his <UNK> that we can't help but smile as he makes his way to <UNK> to make peace with his brother <UNK> who has suffered a stroke and the simplicity of the final scene <UNK> that the real story here is not the destination but the journey it's a journey in which alvin shares his life with everyone he meets to their benefit and <UNK> it's a slow simple relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that we've lost with the <UNK> of america br br the straight story is the rare live action g rated movie that truly should not be missed grade a
<START> a neat <UNK> against <UNK> premise a murdered john <UNK> is found to have <UNK> plague so while the health authority and <UNK> battle everybody and each other trying to find his <UNK> contacts the murderers think the heat is because the <UNK> infected cousin is holding out on them br br this movie is <UNK> available from the internet archive and it's well worth <UNK> a lot all of this movie was filmed in genuine new orleans locations which makes it interesting to look at for what is now period detail though to me it does look under exposed even for noir maybe mobile lighting <UNK> then weren't what they are there is also a plenty of location background noise which is slightly distracting car <UNK> in the love scene anyone there are a lot of non professional supporting artists in crowd scenes and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly <UNK> to begin with not much chance for <UNK> or <UNK> though the final chase is worth hanging on for there's not much wrong with the lead actors either jack palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic intelligent psychopath the later scene as he alternately <UNK> and threatens the sick cousin is terrific while widmark as he often did <UNK> the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level most of the time br br somebody should remake this no <UNK> no <UNK> no special fx just a good yarn full of character conflict and a <UNK> theme another reviewer mentioned the writer john kennedy o'toole and that's spot on with the number of oddball new orleans types <UNK> this dark sleazy against the clock drama there's even a midget newspaper <UNK> br br community what community <UNK> think you're living in the middle ages
<START> after seeing the trailer for this movie and finding out spike lee was directing i was excited to hear about this event i wasn't alive at the time i didn't live in new york so i expected more of a history lesson than anything what i got was some interesting acting a lot of sex and about 30 minutes worth of film that actually had anything to do with the son of sam i guess the film wasn't about the son of sam but it was a <UNK> into the summer of <UNK> label me disappointed br br
<START> when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he <UNK> the <UNK> and ignores <UNK> this is not steven kings best work i thought that his best work was the shining i don't think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick i mean making the gage evil and how he kills <UNK> is genius making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool people who didn't like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all don't expect something from a movie that it isn't it still in a general area wasn't that good i still recommend people to watch the movie
<START> indian burial ground if those three words appear anywhere in a real estate listing look for a different neighborhood a young couple with a young daughter and a <UNK> age son move into a <UNK> house <UNK> to a pet cemetery and after a l o o o <UNK> <UNK> an ancient indian burial ground seems the indian ground can bring fido or <UNK> back from the dead if you don't mind having a raving hell beast for a pet it can do the same for dead people if you don't mind having a homicidal zombie around the house br br throw in a busy two lane <UNK> <UNK> big <UNK> a well meaning if somewhat dim old neighbor and one kid who really doesn't get enough <UNK> and i think you can figure out what happens from there an over the top illogical mess which in all fairness does offer up a few scares br br well there are worse stephen king adaptations such as maximum <UNK> which king also directed but there are far better ones too such as <UNK> lot the dead zone and both versions of the shining
<START> you know the story a group of <UNK> no <UNK> enter a competition they seemingly have no chance of winning it's a tale that has been done to death by hollywood bring it on the karate kid escape to victory best of the best etc now korea gives it a go with a <UNK> team struggling for glory  and guess what  the result is predictable but ultimately satisfying br br the fact that this movie doesn't fall flat on its face is down to the talented young cast who really make you care about the characters and this in turn keeps you watching to the end br br fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed  <UNK> does not deliver the usual <UNK> of moves and <UNK> seen in most kung fu films the action is limited to albeit impressive kicking and the occasional punch this doesn't matter though since it is the interaction of the characters and their fight to make something of themselves which makes this movie a success
<START> absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time i have seen it at least a hundred times and i can't go through it without crying i defy anyone to watch the reunion of <UNK> and <UNK> or <UNK> and father and not feel your eyes getting misty <UNK> goldberg should have one an award for amazing portrayal and for the person who said you can't love the movie if you loved the book wrong im a testament to that
<START> i normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie however this was an unique case this movie was so bad that i actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted needless to say i was brutally disappointed set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing first there are <UNK> plot holes second very few of the c list i don't even dare call them b actors can act worth a damn so any scenes that have potential fail miserably third the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult leading to very few surprises for the audience fourth and most importantly the ending is completely anti climatic partially because of how it ends setting who the killer turns out to be and partially because the dialog is just atrocious to the films credit it is the only movie that i will ever say is the worst movie i have ever scene and i've seen a lot br br so just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no you really don't as you run in the opposite direction
<START> this is where the term classic film comes from this is a wonderful story of a woman's bravery courage and extreme loyalty poor <UNK> got sold to her <UNK> husband who through the years learned to appreciate her yeah right a pearl br br <UNK> rainer was the beautiful star who had won the best actress oscar the year before for her small role and what a waste of an oscar in the great <UNK> it really didn't show what if any talent she had other than her exotic beauty but in good earth she shows that she can really act her beauty was <UNK> and she had no great costumes either people say that she didn't show any real emotions in this film like hell her character <UNK> is a shy and <UNK> woman with inner strength she is quiet during parts of the film with only her eyes and body to convey her emotions example those scenes during the fall of the city and when <UNK> were being shot if you people are saying that she doesn't act well in this film you are not looking br br paul muni shows that he can act as well his character is not a likeable one to me he never sees her for what she is until the very end of the story a sweet loving and dedicated wife and mother with her own special beauty the greatest one of all the beauty from within like a pearl br br if you get a chance to see this film watch it you will see one of the best films that the golden age of hollywood created
<START> young beautiful eva hedy <UNK> marries an older man <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately he can't satisfy her sexually and ignores her frustrated she goes home and plans to get a divorce then one day she's skinny <UNK> in a lake in the middle of the woods her horse <UNK> off with her clothes and she runs after it she meets young and very handsome adam <UNK> <UNK> they make love and she realizes this is the man she wants br br ending spoiler naturally since this was made in 1933 she has to be <UNK> for her sin so it leads to a tragic finale end of ending spoiler br br this horrified people in 1933 but it's pretty tame by today's standards <UNK> nude swim shows nothing and when she runs after the horse totally nude it's either shown in extreme long shot or is covered by <UNK> and such there's only a few minor shots of her breasts also when she has sex with <UNK> nothing is shown but her face but you see her achieving an <UNK> these scene were considered pretty extreme in their day and were cut out completely of the american release now today they're back in this film would get by with a pg 13 easily now br br shock episodes aside this is just ok it is beautifully filmed and there's next to no dialogue except for the music score this could be a silent picture luckily all the actors are good <UNK> and <UNK> especially and they're so attractive that they just take your breath away watching them also the sequence where they make love is easily one of the most beautifully shot and acted sequences i've ever seen in a movie the scenes with the sexual symbolism there's quite a few of them are unfortunately pretty obvious today i actually started to giggle during one br br so great direction beautiful imagery attractive actors good acting all around but i wasn't exactly <UNK> over by it i found the movie slow moving beautiful imagery does not make a picture for me somewhat dull obvious static and had a negative ending i can live with the ending but it doesn't excuse the other problems i had with it also the final sequence is really strange and out of place so i admire this film more than anything else it was well done and i'd recommend it but with caution many people seem to love this movie so i'm in the minority use your own judgment
<START> in film i feel as though it should be more than just art i think it should be more than that a way to tell a story on screen this short from david lynch tells a story but not much of one i felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy it is good film making but there really isn't anything else to it as i've said before i am a huge david lynch fan but i get frustrated by some of his work because i don't see a need for it at all this is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but i know he's still got a ton of talent and i am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future if you like lynch check this out but don't be surprised when you don't like it very much
<START> the sentinel represents everything about the soul <UNK> of hollywood and the <UNK> lack of imagination present in so many movies these days i cannot possibly think of one good thing about it it's all so generic so factory made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an <UNK> on how to make money from the unsuspecting <UNK> public br br a plot about a secret service agent planning to <UNK> the <UNK> could well be entertaining if handled by a good director or caring cast that is douglas is the one who is framed basinger is the first lady with whom he is having an affair an undeveloped <UNK> plot <UNK> sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he didn't and longoria is nothing a woman with a fortune of <UNK> and that's it i guess there are less <UNK> for women when entering the secret service as usual in a film like this the role of the <UNK> himself is nothing more than a tool a token and is very badly written br br clark <UNK> he who gave us the equally as pathetic <UNK> back in 2003 mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap tv movie douglas basinger and sutherland look incredibly bored and phone in their performances from <UNK> eva longoria the most over exposed woman of the 21st century is basically only in this to attract to the desperate <UNK> audience her role is 100 pointless and she does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add to character development she barely has 2 lines to rub together a truly shameless marketing <UNK> br br if you're a <UNK> for punishment then don't let me stop you but it is time and money you won't be getting back
<START> this movie will not sit well with some but it is a must view i am glad someone finally brought up for discussion the realities of how african american couples worked to make a name in <UNK> and how many of them felt trying to stay there as other african americans moved in br br minor spoilers br br this little showtime film is almost like a spike lee joint you have an african american male danny glover who worked his way hard through the <UNK> white law profession positions in the 1970's like any american he moved his family to be <UNK> with his <UNK> mobile status but forgot there was still alot of problems going on the only african americans in the neighborhood at the time was the <UNK> one <UNK> a home wow br br then the <UNK> in began his wife whoopi goldberg is told to get involved so she does what all the other women in her neighborhood do and just when the man thinks he and his family are in right next door comes another african american who got in because they won the <UNK> <UNK> and in his eyes and he wants nothing to do with them for he doesn't want the neighborhood to think they are alike he of course is of a better <UNK> his new neighbor is ghetto not an shouldn't be there who's got a problem now br br what this film shows you is the great pains it takes for this family to fit in and how they lose themselves in the process it makes you question where does racism begin and end and with whom it shows how no matter what colour you are and how much money you have you can still shut yourself off from the real world and helping those around you it also shows how these african american children when <UNK> in <UNK> such as these fall into the trap of changing themselves to suit the culture complete with blonde hair and blue eyes mind you around them they laugh along with the jokes not knowing they are the joke and not knowing why br br but overall this film is about <UNK> no matter what race you are this film gets into how terrible you can be towards your neighbor and toward each other all for the sake of fitting in all because you feel you have more money than others so that automatically makes you better and you forget the struggles you had and those coming up behind you br br again not for everyone but take a look and judge for yourself br br
<START> i loved this film seen this evening on a movie theatre big screen the audience laughed out loud at some very interesting things and the fast pace was most enjoyable br br i do as a singer and musical director question one section of <UNK> <UNK> vocal in by a <UNK> the key <UNK> and she was suddenly singing much lower in a very <UNK> voice that bore no resemblance to the somewhat tin like higher <UNK> voice she used in all her other <UNK> br br does anyone know if this was <UNK> by another singer it sounds it to me i would love to know br br thanks so much
<START> has to be one of the worst wastes of <UNK> movie film ever unleashed on the public the sequel to the at least entertaining pseudo documentary original film the legend of <UNK> creek bad script worse acting etc etc dawn wells had to be hoping that <UNK> would come rescue her and take her back to the island just to escape from this piece of <UNK> trap
<START> i am amazed at how this movie and most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies <UNK> 7 to 10 stars on imdb the <UNK> mentality strikes again when this movie came out just about everyone <UNK> it even my ex girlfriend said this movie questionable years later i sat down to watch this movie and i found myself enjoying even laughing quite a bit this and the replacement killers are the movies that had people <UNK> the director <UNK> <UNK> as the black michael bay i don't see how since most of <UNK> movies are smarter than anything michael bay has came up with at any rate br br story alvin sanders jamie foxx is former convict that is used by a no nonsense <UNK> agent edgar david morse as a <UNK> to catch a killer named <UNK> doug <UNK> <UNK> every moves are <UNK> by a bug <UNK> in his jaw after an accident while these agents are after <UNK> <UNK> is after the gold <UNK> that were taken in a heist gone awry br br jamie foxx is funny as well as great as alvin sanders alvin is a fast <UNK> that is a lot smarter than he lets on doug <UNK> is okay as <UNK> he can be over the top sometimes in his john <UNK> demeanor he was better here than he was as looney bin jim in <UNK> war zone david morse is good as the hard edged <UNK> agent even mike <UNK> is funny as <UNK> brother <UNK> both him and jamie had some funny moments on screen br br the only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat the scenario at the horse race track is way over the top but i couldn't look away the director went all out there so he gets points for that plus the bomb scene with the <UNK> agent tied to a chair while the <UNK> rests on the door was pretty nifty br br all in all bait is not a bad movie by a long shot its never boring its always funny and i wasn't checking my watch every minute that should count for something bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period br br ps to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent how long have you been living under a rock i'm pretty sure you've seen the die hard series and every movie by quentin tarantino but those movies aren't violent right weirdo
<START> yet another film about a tortured self centered arrogant <UNK> hateful self destructive lead character we are supposed to care about br br don't get me wrong i am very open to all kinds of off the wall movies that have as the lead character a strongly self destructive character what i object to about this one is that there is so little background to this guy why did this guy hate himself and the world had the script dealt with this more they might have managed to <UNK> some sympathy for him as it is he just comes off as an unpleasant hateful character not tragic just hateful br br after taking great pains to make this guy as crazy and anti social as possible and making his fate as dark as possible the writer then has the nerve to make a happy ending br br this is not the worst film i have ever seen but it is in there putting up a good fight man don't waste your time
<START> the first power 1990 was a terrible film that came out during the late 80's early 90's era of cheaply made horror films i found this movie very boring but extremely hilarious in some parts this movie lacks so much sense and credibility that it ain't even funny the swift justice system in this film makes texas look weak by comparison lou diamond phillips is in way over his head with this role he plays a hard boiled cop and <UNK> griffith <UNK> more attractive sister plays a psychic don't waste your time with this one because it's bad what a minute i take it back this movie makes a great party film check out the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nun she has the <UNK> legs i've ever seen on a nun that wasn't in a jesus franco <UNK> flick <UNK> br br this marked an end of an era for l d p his star was <UNK> and he couldn't draw flies to a dung heap it was d t v for him until his <UNK> a few years later br br not recommended unless you're desperate
<START> and i never thought a movie deserved to be awarded a 1 but this one is honestly the worst movie i've ever watched my wife picked it up because of the cast but the storyline right since the dvd box seemed quite predictable it is not a mystery nor a juvenile catching film it does not include any <UNK> if that's what the title could remotely have suggest any of you this is just a total no no don't waste your time or money unless you feel like watching a bunch of youngsters in a as grown up kind of gothic setting where a killer is going after them nothing new nothing interesting nothing worth watching max <UNK> makes the worst of nick <UNK>
<START> i saw this film when i was a young child on television thank you canadian <UNK> corporation and had nightmares about it for years afterwards br br <UNK> was one of the <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> one of <UNK> national film <UNK> best animators <UNK> was in turn a mentor and <UNK> for the great <UNK> if you like <UNK> you should see night angel br br the symbolism is obvious but <UNK> used the <UNK> of beauty and life the plant are placed in opposition with the <UNK> of the <UNK> hand the poor puppet hero is condemned despite a lack of political agenda br br what i most remembered was the feeling of <UNK> in the <UNK> the small room where the action takes place is the character's entire world the invasion by the hand is a complete <UNK> of that world br br beautiful and haunting film i found a copy of this and other wonderful shorts by <UNK> at the public library and showed it to my own kids a must see
<START> halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep it is in my opinion the scariest movie of all time michael myers is the best boogeyman ever he was just so terrifying what makes halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is this was on a low budget and had a one note score yet managed to scare the hell out of people 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in <UNK> br br it's about a boy michael myers he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution dr sam <UNK> is after him and will do anything to get him back since he describes michael as pure evil the <UNK> eyes the devil's eyes michael is on a mission though to kill his other sister laurie played by a new jamie lee curtis she has to <UNK> on halloween while her friends are out <UNK> and of course we know the rules they get it but laurie may stand a chance since she's the virgin d br br halloween pays many <UNK> to psycho we have another character named sam <UNK> and jamie lee <UNK> the daughter of janet leigh halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors <UNK> your windows and turn off the lights they're gonna get you they're gonna get you halloween the ultimate horror film br br 10 10
<START> this film made for french tv deals with the tragic effect it has for a close <UNK> family when leo the young man at the center of the story is <UNK> as having the aids virus <UNK> it to his parents they just can't believe it the film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject br br the director <UNK> <UNK> has to be <UNK> for bringing this frank account to the screen nowhere but in france could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter br br the news has a devastating effect on marcel the young brother who hears about what leo has <UNK> in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality br br <UNK> <UNK> and pierre <UNK> do a convincing job in portraying the brothers
<START> i couldn't make sense of this film much of the time and neither could anyone else based on other reviews the opening scene of this film has virtually nothing to do with the rest of the story in it a <UNK> with a big mustache <UNK> his vacation to get away from his girlfriend he is assigned to photograph a mountain range it's <UNK> to be haunted but i couldn't tell whether he heard that from his boss or later in the film on his way he meets a beautiful writer patty shepard and convinces her to join him on his working trip throughout the film there is this terrible music score mostly <UNK> of <UNK> singing that makes you want to scream shut up already what really will <UNK> a person is that the film always seems like it's about to become good though it never does there is beautiful mountain scenery and some genuinely creepy atmosphere the <UNK> and the silent abandoned old buildings scattered on the mountain are rather ominous the <UNK> nights look real not like someone put an artificial fog machine on the set and the idea while not original had potential but it never does improve at least not enough to be worthwhile here's how it goes more or less they stop at this <UNK> run by a weird <UNK> you expect him to be named <UNK> with a hearing problem there is a scene where the writer thinks a <UNK> tom is in her window but the scene is so dark i had no idea what was going on whether this was poor lighting or a poor film transfer is unknown to me in any event we never find out know what happened there is a scene where she wanders off during the night whether she is <UNK> or <UNK> by the witches of the title is never explained another scene which is never explained is when their car is stolen then found again with nothing stolen they wind up in this apparently abandoned mountain village whose sole <UNK> is this seemingly kindly old woman there are other things including a <UNK> wild man in a cave who is never explained an attempt to sacrifice the writer in some way will they kill her or <UNK> her into joining them the witches themselves a bunch of brunette women in white <UNK> who don't show up until the last 15 minutes of the film and whose practices and beliefs are never explained even the closing scene doesn't make any sense when all is said and done most people will be saying huh
<START> national lampoon goes to the movies 1981 is simply put the worst movie ever made far <UNK> than even the inept plan 9 from outer space br br the lampoon film is told in three segments each one supposedly a spoof of a conventional movie genre but each one landing at our feet with a sickening <UNK> there is no rhyme or reason for these <UNK> vignettes and no discernible story lines br br another reviewer on this site has written that the only good points about the film are the nude scenes true misses <UNK> and <UNK> do flash a bit of flesh and very nice it is too but the directors seem not to realize that even t a needs a good story to surround it there's none of that here br br probably the worst of the three segments is the last one featuring <UNK> benson and richard widmark here we see benson as a young eager <UNK> policeman being paired with a cynical <UNK> played by widmark and for just a moment those of us who are still watching this <UNK> cinematic exercise are <UNK> by the thought that we are about to see a <UNK> tale about how the young idealistic cop brings about a <UNK> change in the old <UNK> approach to police work but no such luck as we've said this film has no redeeming values it is sickening all the way to the final fade out which <UNK> is stretched out longer than it should last on the screen apparently the film makers knew they had a bad thing going and wanted to make the least of it
<START> rodney <UNK> is a great he has done a lot of great works but this one is awful the whole plot is <UNK> it could have been much better the jokes in the movie aren't funny their stupid this was very not so hilarious he can do much better than this
<START> i love this show mr <UNK> gordon and <UNK> are cats so different from each other yet they refer to themselves <UNK> as <UNK> ' i often find myself trying to imitate the tired <UNK> accent of their butler <UNK> or even the scottish <UNK> of gordon there should be more episodes made about human <UNK> the episode about the cats <UNK> themselves as pre teen girls to gain <UNK> to human <UNK> <UNK> party in order to get their <UNK> <UNK> on their favorite drink <UNK> is a hilarious classic we can't drink <UNK> in our house now without either doing the <UNK> voices or the <UNK> brothers from the movie <UNK> shot ' future classic where can i get the first two seasons on dvd
<START> the only reason i give this movie an 8 out of 10 is because there are few movies in my opinion that are perfect this little b picture is a taut story well told i've always been intrigued by alexander knox but have seen him very few movies here he plays <UNK> <UNK> a sad little man who turns into a monster he betrays everything and everybody without an ounce of <UNK> the performance is one of the most chilling performances i've ever seen since world war 2 actors who played nazis or other evil types in films have occasionally been nominated for oscars i imagine that since this was made during the war the academy felt like <UNK> a performance like this would have been like <UNK> evil but knox puts in that kind of performance a man so bitter and consumed by guilt that he thinks nothing of making others suffer i still can't get over it br br <UNK> hunt who usually plays the <UNK> <UNK> or social <UNK> is cast against type in probably the best performance i've ever seen her give too maybe not oscar worthy but the best of her career nothing against her i have enjoyed her in those slight roles she often played but here she proves she up to the task of <UNK> drama br br if you like human drama stories or stories about the <UNK> of those who suffered at the hands of the nazis i highly recommend this fine little film
<START> i happen to run into this movie one night so i decided to watch it i was very pleased with the movie i thought it was a wonderful plot it's a great feeling knowing a deceased one has come back and you get that second chance to say what you want to say and this wife stayed devoted for 23 years i thought it was a great movie
<START> after viewing several episodes of this series i have come to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality here is an old science fiction <UNK> <UNK> wrapped in the form of a truly original concept and still they can only almost make it work br br the dialog is good the male actors are reasonably <UNK> at their <UNK> most of the characters are well drawn with special kudos to the hero and his more than likeable side kick and most of the episode plots come across as <UNK> so what could be wrong how about the the female characters and the <UNK> perfect actresses who are chosen to portray them br br the producers insist on portraying the female characters in this almost good series in a manner that makes the end product appear to be a misplaced <UNK> why i ask why br br the episodes all fall flat whenever the female guest star or recurring character comes on screen these actresses are all totally unbelievable in their roles and you don't actually have to see them to know they are incapable of their acting <UNK> a blind person could tell just listen to them talk they deliver their dialog with all the drama and effect of a 16 year old at the high school prom who would believe these women are <UNK> scientist <UNK> corporate executives and medical doctors br br in a nut shell if the producers have their choice of a <UNK> <UNK> or a morgan <UNK> guess who they'll choose every time and of course the series suffers for it too bad
<START> i wasn't as lucky as some of the others commenting on this film i have never seen anything else out of the shall we say <UNK> mind of <UNK> i agree with many some of the actresses who spend a lot of time topless and go go dancing are not really that attractive i kinda liked <UNK> <UNK> she was so <UNK> she was cute the acting was pretty stale also though delivering lines in a second language might have <UNK> for a lot of that problem trying to follow the plot was a major chore was there one really i do <UNK> agree with one other comment for a vampire movie there's not much blood yep if you want good <UNK> flicks check out such hammer classics as horror of dracula and my personal favourite brides of dracula br br the most unintentionally humorous part is where the lady doctor gets her clothes torn off by a cloud of bats which you never see the bats i mean br br okay as a time <UNK> if you happen to catch it on cable here in the great white north but for <UNK> sake don't rent it
<START> this movie <UNK> as a social commentary when in fact it is every bit as ridiculous as the very racism it <UNK> the premise of this movie african american strong any other race weak the worst part is when <UNK> pulls a gun on omar <UNK> and a jewish guy the jewish guy in stereotypical fashion <UNK> in fear and starts <UNK> for his life but the big strong <UNK> omar <UNK> stands strong with no fear we also have the <UNK> of every <UNK> member as being a arrogant <UNK> drunk or rapist the raped white girl of course begins considering <UNK> since she's just a weak white girl after all when the nerdy white guy is rejected by the <UNK> members he of course must fall in with the <UNK> who are incredible <UNK> especially the big muscular guy who is beaten down quickly by the strong black men wait <UNK> <UNK> beat up a guy twice his size yeah right br br of course the black men never reject their own people and omar <UNK> moves in with them easily the scenes where ice cube threatens his white roommates and keeps them in line are just stupid of course he is the <UNK> one while his weak white roommates sit in fear of him and eventually move out this movie was just terrible and the ending made me actually laugh out loud the overly long slow motion between <UNK> and banks gets hilarious with the faces they make it's like watching my nephew and cousins making faces at each other and they're all under 5 do yourself a favor and skip this <UNK>
<START> kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode they intend to <UNK> the inhabitants but find the place deserted except for a mr <UNK> who <UNK> some sort of high tech library despite trying to get a straight answer from him about everyone's <UNK> <UNK> is indifferent to their questions and insist they must quickly <UNK> a selection while there is still <UNK> they have no idea what he's talking about but wander about looking at the hand mirror like <UNK> on the viewers and they see images of the <UNK> past then while a <UNK> is in the viewer kirk runs through the <UNK> and is magically transported back in time to what on earth would look like the time of louis <UNK> the <UNK> when mccoy and spock follow a different <UNK> is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell all too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and <UNK> br br while <UNK> visit is pretty short and not all that exciting spock and <UNK> is much more <UNK> as spock falls head over heels for <UNK> hartley who was sent to this awful place as a punishment the scenes with spock are exceptionally interesting and very <UNK> of the normally logical guy br br <UNK> departure from the norm the wildly inventive script and very diverse locales make this an exceptional episode one well worth seeing br br <UNK> ian <UNK> the excellent character actor played mr <UNK> i am a huge fan of older films and have seen him as a supporting and bit player in countless films in the 30s and 40s and he looked almost exactly like he did in this episode from 1969 interestingly enough despite looking ancient he lived on another 23 years dying at over 95 years of age
<START> someone has already mentioned being at the right time at the right place it was so true for this documentary that i had doubts about the <UNK> of the scenes and thought it included perhaps some acting but it is not it is all real the story is nothing new for the people of the developing and or poor countries it <UNK> light on the manipulation of the people by corporate media the <UNK> the artificial <UNK> of the people by deliberately creating tension on the streets sometimes to the point that the army intelligence agency or even the government many believe led by the us uses agents who attack any side to <UNK> the masses into violence and therefore <UNK> their <UNK> a marine officer in the film mentions this also that they wanted to see the peoples confront on the streets all of these scenarios have been played in turkey <UNK> pet dog in the middle east throughout its history who has experienced 3 <UNK> and lately secret plans made by the turkish army have been exposed ironically through a pro government religious conservative media <UNK> the a religious <UNK> of the army in which a very important <UNK> is bombed by an army agent to <UNK> the people etc br br what makes this film unique is that they were filming from inside perhaps by chance when the events have happened it is clear that the directors are pro chavez whether or not this caused the directors to <UNK> and manipulate the events and the information i would not know br br and whether chavez will be defending the people of <UNK> against the <UNK> of us and the global economy without <UNK> any <UNK> thought with force and in the end becoming a self indulgent <UNK> history will tell br br but at least chavez is hope and i believe it is worth taking the chance
<START> i think this is what this movie wants us to say at the end of the movie or damn australian i still don't know but what i know is that i really liked this movie but that couldn't be my favorite movie br br great story with great actors but with a terrible end to make you cry and say <UNK> she's so <UNK> still who made it what really happened who's that guy no answer to these questions br br mysterious movie with a good mark overall i give it a 8 10 going on the 8 5
<START> this <UNK> film directed by tom <UNK> singer of the well known group <UNK> will not be <UNK> by everyone for the simple reason that there isn't a clear story or even a plot this movie just shows 24 hours in a city here <UNK> and allows you to watch and truly enjoy the dialogues the directing the humorous <UNK> the <UNK> bruno and tragic <UNK> paul <UNK> characters br br there are several memorable scenes the <UNK> on the beach the dance party at the end the kiss fan <UNK> visits the <UNK> br br clearly some other viewers didn't understand what's so beautiful and interesting in this movie they complain that this movie has no story etc but it's the atmosphere that keeps you watching and that will drag you into it br br if you didn't watch it yet be sure to listen carefully to the music the soundtrack is extraordinary just like tom <UNK> and his group <UNK> br br and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> don't tell anyone
<START> in this glorious telling of a weekend shared among literary <UNK> mary and <UNK> <UNK> lord byron and others created a <UNK> group showing their <UNK> for sexual enlightenment personal <UNK> from political to moral liberal drug use for both <UNK> and as addiction their creative views of life and writing describing without boring the viewer how each writer seeks to find their <UNK> along with the <UNK> and affections each share with breathtaking scenery that does not detract but very much enhances the story well created characters from grim to loving then angry to peaceful with some of the most lovely and scene <UNK> <UNK> to be had
<START> the orders fatal flaw besides an <UNK> plot is that the character's simply don't <UNK> or even react br br two examples a priest walking through a graveyard late at night is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits after fighting them off he <UNK> <UNK> his walk when his buddy come up anything wrong his buddy asks having seen the attack just some demonic spirits nothing i couldn't handle no reaction no surprise just like he'd changed a tire his buddy is equally <UNK> must be standard priest training and then you put the <UNK> into their mouths any questions ok moving on demon spirit attacks br br example two at one point the priests need an answer to a question and only a demon or something who cared by now could provide it how why you have to ask a dying man so the demon has some random person hung in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the <UNK> <UNK> man hey don't kill him or maybe that's not nice would have been more realistic then their response they never ask that they let the man go or stop in fact the closest to <UNK> they get is mild annoyance they ask their question and go br br i had to shut it off at that point my brain was starting to <UNK> br br avoid br br one star out of four br br
<START> the plot of <UNK> <UNK> involves college kids who play a cruel phone game that unexpectedly to them if not to fans of horror gets them in over their heads the story of <UNK> <UNK> on the other hand is that of a horror film that had a wee little bit of promise sadly <UNK> by really bad writing br br what could have been a fun if somewhat silly old fashioned slasher tale is <UNK> early on by its <UNK> misguided belief that the audience would enjoy watching a bunch of loud whiny rich kids <UNK> at each other for most of the film's running time with the exception of a police detective played by <UNK> <UNK> in a minor role that is designed mainly to add the movie's only star power every character on screen is a different breed of young a hole br br male and female black and white straight and gay an entire ensemble of shallow and shrill college kids carries the bulk of the film's narrative worse since the tale deals with a party game gone awry most of the time the scenes are completely filled with these little b <UNK> because of this there are few breaks for the viewer who must put up with the angry <UNK> of the <UNK> drawn protagonists even though at least some of these people are supposedly friends <UNK> all characters interact in a very hostile manner long before any genuine conflict has actually <UNK> this leads to the worst possible result in a slasher film the audience intended to care about the leads instead not only cheers on the anonymous killer but wishes that he had arrived to start picking off the vacuous <UNK> far earlier br br the real shame of this poor characterization is that otherwise <UNK> <UNK> actually did have some potential visually it's fine first time directors brian <UNK> and <UNK> taylor know how to build a suspenseful mood they also manage to deliver on some competent if sparse moments of classic 80s style gore surprisingly the <UNK> cast is also fairly able it isn't that the actors aren't capable of expressing realistic human emotion it is simply that the screenplay co written by newcomer <UNK> <UNK> and director <UNK> who <UNK> much better behind the camera than with a keyboard is short of such moments br br <UNK> <UNK> can hardly be recommended as its familiar premise and few thrills can't <UNK> the bad taste left behind by a story driven by a <UNK> of unpleasant characters in this tepid <UNK> the real mystery is why anyone should care about a group of young folk who can't even manage to like each other

<START> liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy <UNK> from the early 18th century he is a true actor he <UNK> the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary mary is such a beautiful woman it's her love that makes rob roy the legend but it's his passion that makes her love <UNK> they need each other tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect in one way or another upon watching the movie you will find cunningham disgusting the scotland scenery is beautiful the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well if you like history romance passion and love you'll enjoy rob roy there is violence and blood but it's <UNK> in telling this story as it should be told no gratuitous violence and you do have to listen carefully if you're not used to a scottish accent one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is <UNK> they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes it's their skill as actors that <UNK> you they don't rely on <UNK> names popularity or sex symbol appeal this is something special
<START> a few years ago a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the michael mann film <UNK> on it after we finished that movie and were about to stand up we saw that there is another film just after tough on the <UNK> <UNK> the owner didn't write it up yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening which lacked credits br br some two hours later i just sat there wondering how could i not have heard of this masterpiece before br br this film was europa lars von trier woke film noir from the dead <UNK> reality with intentionally obvious sets yet often there was haunting similarity with post war german photographs i saw and then the <UNK> cuts br br the story itself is a hard to take moral odyssey that has no happy end a young american <UNK> of german descent comes to post war germany intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his <UNK> dropped but he mostly meets <UNK> and self destructive <UNK> he hires with <UNK> a <UNK> and sleeping car company <UNK> on <UNK> whose owner is one of the nazi <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> our hero falls in love with his daughter who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf nazi post war terrorists when he doesn't understand the world or just europeans anymore in his rage he blows up a <UNK> bridge under a train which he just saved br br as a final note for historical correctness in the real world the werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies they were mostly a final nazi propaganda coup after an ss unit <UNK> the major of allied occupied <UNK> two months before the <UNK> the nazis announced the creation of whole <UNK> of <UNK> and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines the werewolf but only a few hundred of mostly hitler youth received some training and while two or three times some were <UNK> to murder suspected <UNK> or forced <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> lasting fear on inhabitants with hitler's death and the <UNK> end it all fell apart br br however the werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the <UNK> they feared the werewolf everywhere suspected it behind any serious accident but without exception another cause was found later ignored by some recent pseudo historians for example when a gas main <UNK> in the police <UNK> of bombed out <UNK> or when the soviet military commander died in a <UNK> accident in berlin the effect was strongest on the <UNK> who arrested <UNK> of thousands in large part children <UNK> on suspicion of being werewolf and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died
<START> it was 9 30 <UNK> last night at my friend's camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park a new episode the thing is in my country south park <UNK> at 10 30 <UNK> and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing father of the pride i'll start by saying that i have only watched to episodes the first time i watched it i found it unfunny and crude for nothing so i thought <UNK> sh t i have a football game early tomorrow so i have to stop watching stupid <UNK> but yesterday i tried to give father of the pride a second chance i find that it's a complete rip off of the simpsons only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead br br the second thing is i wonder why it got it's tv 14 rating i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar and the only real <UNK> in this show is a few homosexual unfunny jokes the simpsons is also a lot more violent halloween <UNK> and crude i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek 2 well i've got news for him shrek 2 was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family <UNK> however i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile even burst out laughing once three or four times br br all in all i don't mind father of the pride i don't hate it but i don't like either i've seen way better from <UNK> <UNK> br br 3 5 10
<START> now i had the pleasure of first viewing <UNK> man when it premiered on tv back in december of 2000 br br an <UNK> disease expert william hurt <UNK> his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them now some years later he is now in russia or <UNK> i'm not sure where exactly all i know is it takes place somewhere in that area anyway because of budget <UNK> at an <UNK> disease laboratory they are forced to lay off most of their workers one of them a disgruntled security guard named joseph <UNK> played peter <UNK> best known for his role as the <UNK> <UNK> goes in there and demands that they give him his job back he needs this job because he is divorced and he needs it to pay child support so he goes in there a fight breaks out and some things get knocked over dangerous things it's soon discovered that <UNK> has been infected with a deadly <UNK> in fact it's so deadly one drop of his blood will kill a person in matter of seconds soon word gets out and the disease expert hurt is called in to investigate and he later teamed up with an american reporter now <UNK> is determined to get home to see his wife and son and will stop at nothing even if he has to <UNK> the entire russian population br br now as i said before this film is a lot like falling down we have a disturbed person <UNK> here michael douglas in falling down who will stop at nothing to accomplish there goal even if they have to kill a few people in the process next we have a hero type person hurt here robert duvall in falling down who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist br br <UNK> man is in fact a very good film with a good story line and some very good performances br br 8 10
<START> a great addition to anyone's collection br br 12 monkeys is a movie you don't see every day it has excellent actors to go with a excellent story this is not a normal role for bruce willis but he holds the role like he holds john <UNK> br br the virus kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors story is not a new one but the story takes a fresh new direction on it br br a man bruce is sent back in time to get information on a virus which has wiped out most of man kind br br the actors in this were awesome i must give a mention to brad pitt who was hilarious as the mental patient james cole bruce meets in a mental hospital br br the director did an amazing job on bringing us a disturbing picture of a future <UNK> by a man made virus br br the animals seen in the virus world made it feel like they run the world when humans are driven into underground <UNK> br br this movie was excellent and must see and also its a must own br br i very much highly recommend it br br 10 10
<START> i've found the movie offensive for americans which lost somebody in the towers for american people in general pretending to be an homage to horrible facts happened last years each director takes the opportunity to <UNK> with old facts which have none to do with a terrorist attack or criticize <UNK> political behaviour or compare different political situation as they have in own country having this nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of september 11 shame on them
<START> robin williams gave a fine performance in the night <UNK> as did the other cast members however the movie seems rushed and leaves too many loose ends to be considered a must see i think the problem happens because there isn't a strong enough relationship established between the <UNK> and the gabriel <UNK> i had to spell it this way because imdb wants to auto correct the right spelling to no one character the movie runs a little over <UNK> 30 and within the first 15 minutes or so it seems <UNK> begins his search for pete <UNK> the boy <UNK> br br this happens after he talks to the mysterious <UNK> about 3 or 4 times the conversations aren't too in depth mostly <UNK> of how are you i'm in the hospital why did you boyfriend move out etc in the book the kid almost becomes <UNK> shrink and vice versa and the reader understands why he goes in search of this boy once he finds out the kid disappears and thinks he might be a <UNK> br br in the movie <UNK> becomes obsessed with finding <UNK> but the audience is left to wonder why since there really isn't a strong enough bond established between <UNK> and the <UNK> why bother who cares if the <UNK> doesn't exist br br i know there's a difference between a book and a movie but those calls and that relationship was critical to establish on screen because it provides the foundation for the rest of the movie since it doesn't the movie falls apart br br this is surprising because of <UNK> other work tales of the city when it was made into a mini series it worked beautifully
<START> i just purchased and viewed the dvd of this film the dvd transfer is from last year 2001 this 1988 film is really a great little film overlooked by most people i saw it in the theater in 1988 and have loved it ever since i love the opening shot of <UNK> not <UNK> as another user commented makes <UNK> look like one of the most beautiful cities in the world and i must say the tour of <UNK> on the garbage truck with <UNK> is a very <UNK> interesting one tom <UNK> as everyone else has said gives a remarkable wonderful performance the dvd is a good transfer with no extras but a widescreen format i recommend it to those who love the movie
<START> i have seen it it's not good but interesting in an understated way the boys in it are quite <UNK> but the graphic gratuitous final gang rape scene is <UNK> and oh yes the <UNK> <UNK> of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic <UNK> real atrocity is real this film is just atrocious however the film has a look which can draw you in but it seems to me that is the <UNK> new clothes but in fact in reverse the film looks good but the direction story content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous if a feeling can be vacuous this is it
<START> great movie i loved it great editing and use of the soundtrack captures the real feeling of indian life yet we can all relate a well chose cast with some great characters the movie develops all the characters so that you real care about them all and you feel like you know them the use of the indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is great and the direction really works as everyone comes off as real and natural you just can't help but to root for jess in this film the acting was really good even the <UNK> walk and body <UNK> of both leading ladies is very convincing as a someone that played lots of soccer
<START> had i watched it in my teenage years this movie was mildly entertaining what i liked about soul survivors were the gothic atmosphere during the party scenes and the constant <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> br br had there not been movies like 'the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> look <UNK> i would have been surprised by the ending
<START> this movie is <UNK> best i still cant get enough of watching some of his best stunts ever i also like the bad guys in this movie the old man looks like a chinese version of john howard unlike some of <UNK> other work this movie has also got a great story line and i recommend it to all of <UNK> fans
<START> this fantastic <UNK> is an early prototype of what soon became a very popular film genre i was happy to see william powell handling a detective story with charisma and charm and without the silly attitude of his nick charles character from the thin man series while the story is good on its own i think what really makes this movie fun to watch is michael <UNK> fantastically imaginative direction from a visual point of view this is a richly <UNK> movie with <UNK> showing an incredible command of the medium from split screen images to weird camera angles and imaginative flashbacks <UNK> demonstrates that he was one of the best hollywood directors highly recommended if you are fan of this type of movie
<START> her deadly rival 1995 starring harry <UNK> annie <UNK> lisa zane tommy <UNK> susan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> robert c <UNK> d l anderson william blair sean bridges robin <UNK> <UNK> fitzgerald <UNK> frye stan kelly deborah <UNK> david <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> chuck <UNK> amy <UNK> melissa suzanne <UNK> ralph <UNK> al <UNK> jeff <UNK> daria <UNK> director james <UNK> screenplay dan <UNK> br br actor harry <UNK> of la law fame clash of the <UNK> and other films seems perfectly cast in this lifetime type film directed by james <UNK> and released in 1995 he and his wife lisa <UNK> would later work on a film about sex addiction her deadly rival is at first glance similar to the better known hollywood box office hit fatal attraction in rival happily married couple jim and kris <UNK> move into a new home in the typically beautiful <UNK> they have the seemingly perfect marriage they are deeply in love despite a routine lifestyle but then a mysterious admirer sets her eyes on jim her identity is never revealed despite an attempt by jim and even <UNK> to discover who she is she constantly <UNK> jim through phone calls and letters his marriage nearly <UNK> as his wife begins to think he's having an affair and trying to cover it up while harry <UNK> annie <UNK> and the rest of the cast lisa zane tommy <UNK> susan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> robert c <UNK> d l anderson william blair each seem to be straight out of a soap opera but this is a very suspense filled drama and has its good moments there is a twist at the end spoiler alert all i have to say is her deadly rival was only herself based on a supposedly actual case <UNK> wife kris suffered from multiple personality disorder and that was what ruined her marriage even if the story is not terribly impressive even if the acting is only a step above soap opera acting this film has its moments especially moving are the intimate scenes between jim and his wife and the final scene in which when jim learns the truth he can't believe what he has just heard the movie is probably a little too long and boring in some parts but it's the kind of tv movie that usually does well especially on lifetime which continues to produce films of this kind of the domestic thriller type or seduction stories trashy but everyone likes trash
<START> when i first saw this movie the first thing i thought was this movie was more like an anime than a movie the reason is because it involves vampires doing incredible stunts the stunts are very much like the matrix moves like the moving too fast for bullets kinda thing and the jumping around very far another reason why i the movie is good is because the adorable anime faces they do during the movie the way gackt does his <UNK> faces or just the way they act very anime i think that it's a really good movie to watch the action in this movie is a 10 not to mention gackt and hyde too are a 10 if you are gackt and hyde fans you have to see it
<START> moon child starring japanese <UNK> hyde and gackt was a better movie then i expected in fact i was very impressed and it immediately became one of my favorite movies br br set in <UNK> the story follows a group of street <UNK> sho <UNK> brother <UNK> and <UNK> who rob and murder to make a living on one of <UNK> sho encounters <UNK> <UNK> vampire burning in the <UNK> through the coarse of events <UNK> true nature is shown yet no one <UNK> him away br br the time passes and implies that the immortal never changing <UNK> has raised sho and the two have a an extremely close bond sho and <UNK> then encounter son in an outrageous gun fight and they become quick friends both <UNK> and hyde fall in love with son's sister <UNK> che br br time <UNK> ahead again and shows a grown sho this time void of <UNK> it also explains that sho and son have become enemies br br through tragedy after tragedy this movie <UNK> into the reality of life and all it's <UNK> focusing on friendship and love it is a truly touching movie that is sad yet beautiful at the same time br br as for the acting i think gackt did a magnificent job hyde did an amazing job for a first <UNK> br br the shots were beautiful but the movie did have it's rare and short gruesome shots br br all in all i must say this movie is amazing moving and i highly recommend it
<START> if you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in 1974 this is the movie for you but you'll have to listen to a lot of <UNK> and <UNK> too see my remarks on my girl 1 for the reference br br indulgent admission i approached my girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance having just viewed its predecessor but as an <UNK> preparing to finally set upon a search for my <UNK> my girl 2 made me look with its theme of searching for mother br br put another way anything i liked about my girl 2 had nothing whatsoever to do with my girl 2 but relating to a protagonist who asks like so many <UNK> who's my mama and if there are home movies of my mom in an acting <UNK> i'll be sure to make my own movie about it br br people are <UNK> movies should not be <UNK> my girl 2 like my girl 1 is just <UNK> br br avoid unless you're a complete <UNK> who's <UNK> by a series of small <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie twice through a <UNK> church my family attended in <UNK> <UNK> in the 1970's i was of the tender age of 6 my brother 4 then again when i was 8 my brother 6 this movie terrified my brother and i and shaped how we viewed the world with <UNK> it wasn't just the movie but it was also the philosophy that <UNK> so many christians about the mark of the beast and the rapture this movie the church and a <UNK> <UNK> upbringing lead to severe paranoia towards the future for years i lived under the <UNK> affects of the church and fear of being forgotten by christ i am now 40 years old went through years of <UNK> i once explained to a psychiatrist this movie and the belief system of the church and family i was <UNK> with a <UNK> disorder i actually began to believe this it was my brother who reminded me that this <UNK> philosophy actually happened i no longer fear the future i have come to terms with the fear <UNK> into it's members by the church i have taken this experience to fulfill a purpose i am <UNK> my <UNK> as a psychologist <UNK> in childhood trauma
<START> i admit the first time i watched even <UNK> get the blues i didn't think it was very memorable in any regard but now after viewing it the <UNK> time i admit that it has very much grown on me the characters of sissy ms <UNK> and the <UNK> have become very endearing and the romance between sissy and <UNK> seems very sweet though the plot is very weak i think the satirical humor more than makes up for it then there's the kick ass soundtrack which features the tremendously talented k d lang who reminds me a little of <UNK> <UNK> at her best i can't think of any movie that has grown on me after an <UNK> first impression as much as <UNK> has
<START> i have loved this movie ever since it's debut in 1981 i have lost track of how many times i have seen it it never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up if i am feeling down the three leads are fantastic and the script is priceless plus how do you not get nostalgic hearing the theme song i think i quote this movie without realizing it i basically know the entire script so when someone is watching it for the first time i have to hold back saying something about how funny the next line it i can't even narrow it down although sir john's character probably gets the most memorable ones the famous i'll alert the media when arthur <UNK> his intention to take a bath is still priceless but the list is truly endless the <UNK> at <UNK> soon to be <UNK> father's house are a scream particularly his interactions with the <UNK> do yourself a favour and see this movie
<START> it's such a shame that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football bend it like beckham is much more than a cheesy sports flick the story line is touching and intelligent without being <UNK> the jokes were laugh out loud funny and the characters are well acted <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> knightley are brilliant as teenagers jess and jules putting in great performances both on and off the pitch <UNK> <UNK> is wonderful as <UNK> worried father and jonathan rhys meyers who was so amazingly evil in <UNK> with the devil ' comes across so well as the nice guy for once making full use of his gorgeous irish accent even if you don't like football go see this film if anything it'll make you smile
<START> what we have here is a damn good little nineties thriller that while perhaps lacking in substance still provides great entertainment throughout it's running time and overall does everything you could possibly want a film of this nature to do i saw this film <UNK> because it was directed by john <UNK> a highly underrated director behind great thrillers such as the last seduction <UNK> and <UNK> i figured that if this film was up to standard of what i've already seen from the director it would be well worth watching and red rock west is certainly a film that <UNK> can be proud of the plot focuses on the overly moral michael a man travelling across america looking for work he ends up finding it one day when he stumbles upon a bar in red rock county only catch is that the job is to murder a man's wife he's been mistaken for a killer named <UNK> but instead of doing the job he plays both sides against each other and eventually plans to make a <UNK> however his attempts to escape are <UNK> and he finds himself in a bad situation when the real <UNK> turns up br br john <UNK> appears to enjoy setting thrillers on the road he did it three years earlier with kill me again and again almost a decade on from this film with <UNK> it's not hard to see why <UNK> chooses this sort of location as it provides a fabulous atmosphere for a thriller the likes of this one <UNK> also provides his film with a <UNK> <UNK> like atmosphere as the plot mainly focuses on the central character and the word he is <UNK> into is full of dark and mysterious characters the acting is largely very good with nicholas cage doing an excellent job in the lead role and getting a class support from lara flynn boyle j t walsh and of course dennis hopper who once again <UNK> the screen with his over the top performance it has to be said that the second half of the film isn't as gripping as the first but red rock west certainly is never boring and the way that <UNK> <UNK> the grand finale is excellent in that all the central characters get to be a part of it overall red rock west is a film that you're unlikely to regret watching it's thrilling throughout and you can't ask for much more than that
<START> this is one of the better comedies that has ever been on television season one was hilarious as were most of the following seasons the only reason that i give this show a 9 10 is because of the unfortunate final season the only good part of the final season was the finale my favorite part of this show was the scenes that cut to people's <UNK> often depicting the characters in famous tv shows or movies from the 70's it is a rare show in that i liked every character with the exception of the final season too late to try to develop a new character and <UNK> wasn't nearly as funny <UNK> foot in your ass comments never got old nor did <UNK> stupidity bravo to fox for keeping such a good show so long too long even
<START> a film as bad as this should be <UNK> from all stores world wide so full of boring dull unimaginative characters and with a lead character with such an annoying attitude and dry voice constantly giving a <UNK> voice over for every action and feeling this film holds the record for the most challenging film i have ever watched as i had <UNK> money to own it i felt a duty to see it through and how i regret it my head hurt throughout because of the terribly dull characters and their pointless plot less lives a bunch of kids who have zero knowledge about anything are all <UNK> and worst of all have terrible dialogue throughout just <UNK> around as the main character tries to get a date with the girl boring so much so my friend was shaking with hatred and i was red with embarrassment that i'd thrown away <UNK> the dvd was on ebay the following day and i didn't make much of my money back avoid like the plague
<START> i liked nearly all the movies in the dirty harry series with the exception of the one i think is titled <UNK> <UNK> was a bit weak in areas too but i still enjoyed it this one is one of my favorites of the series if nothing else for the great line of go ahead make my day this one also features an interesting albeit familiar plot of someone killing those that have done her wrong just think <UNK> force with less mystery about who is behind the killings and you have your plot granted there is a bit more than that as this one does feature a very nice final showdown at an amusement park it also features dirty harry getting a <UNK> as a gift and it <UNK> up sandra locke in a rather humorous scene the only question that remains is why clint eastwood had to have the rather mediocre actress sandra locke in so many of his movies she brings the score down a point every time even when overall the movie is enjoyable to me granted she is not to bad here but her character could have been so much better by someone else another problem with this movie and other dirty harry movies at times they almost seem to be <UNK> for guns i like guns as much as the next person but do we really need scenes of him explaining all the different strengths of his <UNK> weapon and how many bullets it holds still very nice entry into the dirty harry series of movies
<START> being a big fan of the other planet of the apes films i rented this dvd despite my <UNK> to all things tim burton once again he doesn't fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction even the ape makeup looks second rate which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity mark <UNK> proves once and for all that he is not an actor as if boogie nights wasn't proof enough i was embarrassed for genuine talents such as tim roth and helena bonham carter no doubt their <UNK> motivated them since it couldn't possibly have been the cliche ridden screenplay i rented this dvd on a special 1 night and i still feel ripped off
<START> sabrina the teenage witch was one of my favorite t v shows of life d i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school so far i think i've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times melissa joan hart plays the perfect teenage girl witch with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to she's funny smart <UNK> witty and a lot more caroline <UNK> and beth <UNK> both fit the part very well as <UNK> aunts <UNK> the intelligent scientist and <UNK> the crazy wacky one make a perfect balance in <UNK> life though i must agree that the college years aren't as good as her high school years but that doesn't mean they weren't still good i think the ending was awesome although it was not what i hoped it made sense and i loved it anyways
<START> this was another great tom berenger movie but some people are right it was like another sgt barnes character but it was still <UNK> tom berenger played a great sniper in the <UNK> of <UNK> billy zane was a <UNK> at first just like <UNK> <UNK> from saving private ryan but then he got a little more <UNK> in the end sniper was <UNK> and action buffs should watch it i remind you it <UNK> have as much action as a <UNK> action flick i got this one on dvd too and it is excellent
<START> i did not read anything about the film before i watched it by chance last saturday evening and then as i was watching it i felt the misery of lena and <UNK> into my bones i was so captivated by the acting and the tone and the filming that i listened only partially to the dialogues my husband fell asleep soon after we went to bed and i was <UNK> under the impact of the film i wanted to wake him up just to say if i would ever vote for an oscar nomination it would be for these two actors i decided to wait until the next day then i read more about the film on imdb and was sad to learn that mr <UNK> died before the release of the film and that he had probably never seen the last version of his brilliant masterpiece i still want to tell him that to me his film was a true independent film in its concept and spirit the actors are to be praised not only for their brilliant performance but for accepting a part with no shine no showing off well to the contrary displaying the true image of human depression sad but poignant
<START> a somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about world war two dangers the mystery is whether or not jane <UNK> nancy coleman has <UNK> the best acting is done by raymond massey as dr <UNK> a good doctor turned evil he is head of a spy ring attempting to get information from <UNK> jane <UNK> information related to allied activities will she tell can she remember <UNK> <UNK> as mr <UNK> is convincing as an <UNK> to massey the role played by john garfield as dr lewis is nothing short of disastrous he seems so badly miscast that the casting has to be <UNK> as one of the worst in film history it is unfortunate that so talented an actor is stuffed into a role which not <UNK> his talents the movie is worth one look despite being a half spy and half gangster film and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters it's easy to forget this one <UNK> is not necessary
<START> like many of you i am a great fan of the real thing the 1940s noir films but red rock west was a real treat for all of us longing for the past the term <UNK> <UNK> has been so often used <UNK> in the last ten years that it has lost its meaning and its impact john <UNK> film on the other hand truly deserved to be described as such the casting is perfect all around and would have felt right at home with <UNK> <UNK> or jacques <UNK> the plot is so tight that you are hooked within the first fifteen minutes james m cain would have appreciated it many contemporary films leave me wondering why they don't make them like they used to and i'm not even that old movies such as red rock west give us hope for the future while paying tribute to the past
<START> the child actors were annoying also it seems as if the makers on this film were struggling to fill 90 minutes decent death scenes though if not for the death scenes this movie would have a very <UNK> feel to it br br the main child protagonist didn't seem nearly as scared as she should have been if i was in the middle of the woods with a tooth fairy ghost killer type individual you can bet your <UNK> i wouldn't be out wandering around and riding my bike br br overall i've seen worse i e it waits but it's nothing i would watch again or recommend anyone bothering with it unless you're an avid horror collector
<START> based on tom <UNK> satirical novel that was praised by all i have not read it yet tom hanks stars as a wall <UNK> who accidentally kills a black boy while lost in a bad part of nyc willis stars as the reporter who starts hanks on his <UNK> spiral the characters are very thin and there seems to be no empathy for anyone in this movie and for a comedy or a satire there <UNK> a lot of laughs either <UNK> griffith had her breasts done during filming so a fun thing to do is to see if her boobs change size during different parts of the film this will keep your mind off other things like the lack of script or humor on a scale of one to ten 3
<START> i had a video of the thing and i think it was my fourth attempt that i managed to watch the whole film without <UNK> off to sleep it's slow moving and the idea of a mid atlantic platform which may have been revolutionary at the time is now just a great big <UNK> apart from conrad <UNK> the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting when the water started to <UNK> big time it even on one occasion woke me up br br but give the man his due no one could hold a cigarette like conrad <UNK> he doesn't <UNK> it between his <UNK> and middle fingers like the lesser <UNK> he holds it in his fingers while showing us the old <UNK> <UNK> there are a few scenes in this film where the smoke <UNK> up to heaven against a dark background and looks very artistically done but it does not say much about this film if all that <UNK> you is the <UNK> smoke
<START> twelve years ago production stopped on the slasher flick hot blooded since almost everyone on the set started dying now a couple of film students have decided to finish the film despite the fact that there's a <UNK> that the film is cursed well they're about to find out that some <UNK> are real br br when scream was released every country seemed to want to cash in on its success even australia the concept which today has been done to death a slasher film within a slasher film was at the time relatively cool and original this movie was released right before urban legends final cut and scream 3 well not in the us but in australia so it felt like the first movie with this concept when urban legends 2 was released most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie wasn't even good the movie <UNK> <UNK> now cut is not the best slasher flick ever and nor does it try to be it knows that it's a rip off and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of <UNK> campbell in the starring role but instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story they've decided to rip off some 80s slasher flicks like nightmare on elm street as well and surprisingly enough this actually works the killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer and instead of trying to scare the audience to death they've created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie there are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that i wasn't able to fully ignore the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie spoiler ahead i mean they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene it makes no sense i tell you end of spoilers all in all cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but i consider this to be one of the better scream rip offs that never made it big i'm surprised that this one never got a sequel but i guess it simply came out too late br br suspenseful australian slasher flick with very few scares cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and i will have to recommend this one even though i consider the story to be quite silly since it's completely ludicrous
<START> the story is somewhat stilted what with the main character's sudden <UNK> of fortune but leslie howard and bette <UNK> portrayals of philip carey the <UNK> obsessed lover and mildred rogers the <UNK> object of his affections raise this film considerably above standard melodrama br br sensitive <UNK> philip who for most of the picture is in bondage to first his <UNK> and then his pity for mildred is not unlike a character howard was to play a few years later ashley <UNK> the southern gentleman too <UNK> and decent to make it in the rough <UNK> era philip in fact seems <UNK> to disappointment even before mildred enters the <UNK> doesn't even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him he'll never make it as a painter it is perhaps this <UNK> these <UNK> expectations that makes him put up with the selfish cockney waitress for as long as he does br br although leslie howard is memorable today of human bondage is mainly thought of as a bette davis picture perhaps because of the well known story of how she had to fight jack warner to get the part of mildred and perhaps too because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her sort of <UNK> energy mildred may have a grating voice but she also has the <UNK> beauty of a <UNK> glass angel making it somewhat understandable why philip let himself be strung along for as long as he did although man eating mildred may at times seem one dimensional she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and <UNK> realizes that philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her one may also think she is on to something when she <UNK> philip of looking down on her for not being fine enough the scene in which philip and <UNK> dismiss romance magazines as trash for kitchen <UNK> seems to confirm this br br most of the supporting characters are also effective particularly <UNK> the sensible romance writer who loves philip but knows she can never compete with mildred and sally who has <UNK> beauty and <UNK> decency and emerges as the deserving woman philip is rewarded with in the end the only character i found hollow was <UNK> eccentric <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> father who seems like a stock character from an earlier era br br a classic that deserves it reputation
<START> no real plot to this one just a series of short skits acting out some very old jokes i <UNK> once or twice in the beginning much to my <UNK> but even at only 73 minutes this film wears out it's welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious with some nudity <UNK> in here and there to keep you awake still as bad as this movie is and that's pretty <UNK> it's a comedic gem compared to pretty much anything by aaron <UNK> jason <UNK> date movie epic movie meet the <UNK> also the song is sadly kind of catchy in a sad way br br eye candy 11 pair of tits 3 <UNK> 3 <UNK> br br my grade d br br code red dvd extras original trailer for this film and trailers for beyond the door dead pit the farmer obsessed ones power play sole survivor wacky taxi
<START> the plot it's not so original if someone saw <UNK> <UNK> there's nothing new a wealthy family in rome living everyday life that's is boring and false with everyone asking to others what they think about them really boring after an half of hour because it's simple to understand where the story is going to finish this because it's simple to see the <UNK> view of <UNK> in this movie so even the hardest parts seem normal to <UNK> in the first 2 minutes of the movie it would be enough and the aim of the movie were already said the family saw from a 30 years old i don't like to see movie that want to show the reality but for be coherent to his thoughts has to push more than the normal the situations really good how <UNK> put the camera in the right place moving with the <UNK> and it's the only reason that bring me not sleeping in the cinema though always in the movie scream from the <UNK> perhaps it could be good to see the family how they are in reality and not put the blame to something out of it <UNK> was intense and great as usual but <UNK> on a bad movie
<START> this movie is an awesome non stop laugh riot <UNK> all the usual ingredients of a <UNK> <UNK> comedy bumbling heroes <UNK> supporting characters made up dolls for <UNK> nasty villains <UNK> <UNK> soundtrack choreography and a little dose of action br br amitabh bachchan and govinda both are in double roles of policemen and <UNK> the heroine of amitabh the cop is <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> is opposite govinda the cop <UNK> are mere <UNK> <UNK> props as usual the <UNK> have no <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> carries his villainous act in <UNK> forward he played a similar don in <UNK> too <UNK> shines in a brief role he does a <UNK> on his famous <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> act in sholay br br govinda is impeccable as usual as a <UNK> good <UNK> policeman <UNK> <UNK> and as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> <UNK> style of hindi speaking with hilarious results amitabh bachchan believe it or not <UNK> in comparison with him but still <UNK> is fine <UNK> <UNK> does a cameo as herself in the song <UNK> she dances like wind br br <UNK> <UNK> music is awesome check out <UNK> disco <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the title track br br do not go looking for any logic since it is a comedy and the screenplay is of <UNK> completely just enjoy yourself
<START> italy produced a lot of really great and original horror films in the 1960's and this is certainly one of them the first thing you will notice about <UNK> macabre is the style of the film shot in beautiful black and white and due to director antonio <UNK> use of lighting the film almost looks like it could be a german <UNK> horror film this coupled with the horror filled plot line <UNK> that <UNK> macabre is a film that truly captures the essence of horror of course the fact that the beautiful barbara steele appears in the film doesn't harm matters and the good news continues as in this film she gets to <UNK> her acting <UNK> more than she did in the films that made her famous the plot is very aware of the time in which this was released and so <UNK> the great edgar allen poe we follow alan foster a writer who accepts a bet from poe himself and lord <UNK> that he can't spend an entire night in the <UNK> creepy old castle everyone that has spent the night there previously has died and our hero is about to meet the previous <UNK> <UNK> br br nowadays horror films don't tend to focus so much on each shot and the result is that there isn't much beauty left in the genre it is refreshing therefore to see this film many of the shots here are incredibly beautiful from the female side of the couple wearing just a see through <UNK> to my personal favourite a shot of smoke <UNK> in from under a door this my first antonio <UNK> film and even after seeing just this one it's obvious that he was one of <UNK> <UNK> directors also interesting is the fact that screenplay was co written by another of the italian <UNK> <UNK> creator sergio <UNK> the plot can <UNK> a little too much at times but there's always enough atmosphere on hand to make sure that the film never becomes boring and the fact that it is always intriguing even when the plot slows down <UNK> the same thing the way that <UNK> macabre <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> theme is both well done and original and helps to keep the story as eerie as possible on the whole fans of italian and or cult cinema will not want to miss this little gem
<START> i had very low expectations for this alleged re imagining of the original and they weren't even met what were they thinking answer they weren't please don't waste your time on this hollywood trash fest clip your nails balance your <UNK> do anything besides watch this remember if you rent stuff like this it will only ensure they make more
<START> in a way corridors of time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal being seen by thousands but it fails at making them laugh br br les <UNK> has had its success because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel forget about <UNK> back to the future here comes the old france the middle age knight and its nearly <UNK> way of life full of pride funny thanks to the ancient words he uses <UNK> can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor then comes the sequel br br nobody had <UNK> the tremendous success of les <UNK> the first and it's no use being a movie expert to realize that the corridors of time has been made for money br br the general story begins after the end of les <UNK> and immediately tries to justify the sequel with a time <UNK> that would have needed some second <UNK> explanation it's no use trying to get back the jewelry <UNK> has stolen don't you remember this nice red shiny and expensive car he bought at the end of the 1st episode where do you think he found the money selling the jewelry and that's only one of many holes <UNK> tries to avoid and fails br br let's have a look at the characters <UNK> doesn't change he's just a little more boring regarding <UNK> that's another story <UNK> <UNK> decided not to compromise herself in this sequel to avoid getting stuck in the <UNK> role and muriel robin tries to imitate her in a way that i found so pitiful i nearly felt pain for her and <UNK> doesn't realize that a cast of <UNK> isn't enough to make a good comedy br br forget about the time travels about the digital effects concentrate on the story and you'll see that there's enough room on a mail <UNK> to write it 10 times br br the main interest of this film is the landscapes a movie for youngsters let's say up to 13 years old
<START> let's get some things straight first zombies don't exist so the filmmaker can have them walk run hell even fly if he wants to that's what makes this original zombie movie so good everything they did was so damn original i hate it when filmmakers do everything like romero or when fan boys expect everything like romero some idiots think that zombies should only <UNK> like a typical romero movie once again zombies don't exist so a filmmaker can make zombies <UNK> if he wants the zombies in this movie all look very good but obviously they are not <UNK> corpses since they just freaking died they are pretty messed up though and full of chopped faces and blood one of the coolest scenes was a half eaten cat it looked so damn real my daughter cried when she saw it this movie got really good reviews in <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> so that made me want to go see it i'm glad i listened they are always right when it comes to real horror <UNK> tastes 10 out of 10 go rent it
<START> you'd be forgiven to think a <UNK> director from <UNK> would be no good at directing an american horror movie especially one entirely located inside a us prison see this to prove yourself wrong it was produced in the 80's after all and the film was made on a budget more fitting to a modern <UNK> company tv <UNK> something i think anyone would really notice nowadays what with practically everyone being <UNK> to <UNK> budgets for action movies unfortunately <UNK> the industry mind being mr <UNK> first major production and the at least what nowadays would be considered a stellar cast i still think most of the <UNK> contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with <UNK> <UNK> screen appearances not mentioning the well overrated mr s bergman directorial efforts at least for all female viewers but this flick really proves there does exist proper movie talent outside of the us and hollywood to make us watch a film in suspense do try and watch this movie even if you're not a horror <UNK> imo it's definitely worth it
<START> this movie needs to be put on dvd it was so funny and i loved it really really cute and funny not realistic but not suppose to be the only thing i did not like about it was the girl relying on the guy too much it represents the time period way of thinking though i have been trying to get this movie for so long and it has been <UNK> for us format only in the uk and will not play on us dvd players it is sadly an over looked classic film believe it or not but this film could easily become a cult favorite for all ages too bad we do not <UNK> certain things that could really save small countries or our own lindy is <UNK> a positive character that makes <UNK> out of <UNK> she is funny and charming she stole the show
<START> i didn't know what to except so i think it was a lot better not having <UNK> much don't get my wrong its not a bad short film tess <UNK> is a relatively new <UNK> and writer so i think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film you can tell that it has been an act of love for her the acting outside of dominic is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good there was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on though i don't feel it greatly <UNK> for one's ability to understand the film if you love dominic <UNK> as much as i do i say go for it the gag reel was fun i won't spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over if you like the film then check out the pink mirror a film also done by <UNK> edge i know fans of dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven
<START> on mtv <UNK> all the <UNK> and shot <UNK> pull the classic movie scarface out of their dvd collection this may give you an idea that scarface is a gangster movie sure there are gangsters and <UNK> in it but that's not the point of scarface tony montana al pacino is just a cuban <UNK> looking for a new way of life he falls in with the mob group and becomes a well known drug lord montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life the classic phrase say hello to my little friend is in scarface this quote is what always comes to mind when i think about brian <UNK> movie scarface this falls under my top 10 favorite movies i would rate it 1 2 out of definitely a movie you must see phenomenal
<START> if you've ever wondered why they don't make porn with a plot watch dream quest on the one hand you have to give the armstrong credit both for making the effort to capitalize on this idea and for using such a strong adult cast to put some name power behind it on the other hand it also quickly becomes apparent why most <UNK> never have more than 15 or 20 seconds of dialog connecting sex scenes together these people simply cannot act and the story is unfortunately lame to a ridiculous degree br br still i gave it a 7 because it was a nice try and there didn't seem to be much of an effort to cut <UNK> also i'd like to see more attempts like this one maybe someday i will see the perfect combination of porn and plot
<START> i'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood <UNK> would be more enjoyable than this dreck it finishes the destruction of what was once a classic couple of films with jedi menace <UNK> and <UNK> we have the death of <UNK> career he wants us to swallow the <UNK> is vader nonsense i never believed it was true this film <UNK> those feelings the story hasn't worked since phantom moron and each new film just <UNK> the crap on until all that was left was a toy parade i have to go i know where some new rocks to throw are you want spoilers here they come luke and leia are not related vader is not their father duke <UNK> should have switched sides while he still could <UNK> has less verbal skills than <UNK> <UNK> his advice has never been any good to anybody <UNK> wan <UNK> to luke for the first two films <UNK> didn't build <UNK> he found him in the desert and <UNK> to his mom about putting him together from scratch <UNK> has <UNK> this whole mess with vader and the fall of the republic can be blamed on that stupid b h <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> if she had any brains she wouldn't have come within a light year of annie but she had told do what george lucas wrote for her what a <UNK>
<START> if you r in mood for fun and want to just relax and enjoy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is one of the movies to watch amitabh started off pretty good but it is govinda who steals the show from his hands awesome timing for and good dialog delivery its inspired from bad boys but it has indian <UNK> to it people think it might be confusing and stupid but the fact that david <UNK> is directing and govinda is acting should not raise any questions other recommended movies in the same genre david <UNK> govinda <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> no 1 <UNK> no 1 hero no 1 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this show is terrible the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse i am one of those people who was never a big fan of corner gas but at least i liked it at first until it got into a <UNK> around season two all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them well at least corner gas was good at first little <UNK> on the <UNK> is typically awful bland cbc comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1 who are the people who are watching this show anyway i am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the <UNK> maybe the jokes are for them and they work there i don't know a single person who likes this show and can't stand it myself the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in corner gas hopefully it won't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being muslim which is different and could should have led to a great show
<START> usually i don't think hollywood productions are fit to be called film so i call them <UNK> instead but this piece of elephant <UNK> is not even fit to be called a movie hence the quotes in the title br br where shall i start 1 if this isn't the start of <UNK> casting it sure is the epitome of it <UNK> powers is supposed to play someone even less than half her age she's supposed to play an 18 year old and she is forty <UNK> two br br 2 a horrible and stupid mindless portrayal of paris and france where we see cliché characters such as the sympathetic grumpy shop owner the bitchy queen of models the fairy god mother ex queen of models etc this film is <UNK> only in this respect by the da <UNK> code which reviewers correctly determined was a comedy br br 3 it's highly and utterly ridiculous to have no nudity in a film about a time and a place where nudity was so common place especially if the whole focus is about that br br 4 the horrible accents br br 5 the <UNK> <UNK> elevator music br br i could go on but i think this is enough and i was able to make these observations after watching this crap for just half an hour while surfing the internet and talking to my friends about <UNK> <UNK> i mean br br i invite everyone to add to my list p d
<START> <UNK> <UNK> can be a skilled filmmaker under the right conditions but <UNK> tells the story of a warrior monk and his only rival a <UNK> of the <UNK> clan the film making has the main <UNK> of a low budget production including <UNK> fight scenes and clumsy montages the kind you might find in an under produced <UNK> the monk <UNK> informs his spiritual teacher that his destiny lies in <UNK> the mysterious spirit that guards <UNK> bridge at night but he doesn't realize that this decision will bring him <UNK> into conflict with nearly every element of society at that time but which could earn him enlightenment br br there's no absence of <UNK> however in its depiction of the conflict between the holy and the <UNK> artsy <UNK> in some of the photography and editing help to compensate for the loose film making style br br a disappointment
<START> come on people this movie is better than 4 i can see this happening wealthy people have done <UNK> things than this and it was funny br br i watch a comedy to be entertained escape from the <UNK> of the world for a short while and not to have to take anything too seriously this movie fully suits that purpose i judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare surviving christmas to blazing <UNK> i watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home it will remain on my list of favorite must watch for the holiday season if you just want to have a fun 90 minutes watch this one
<START> in a college <UNK> a guy is killed by somebody with a <UNK> his girlfriend beth <UNK> barton discovers him and tries to commit suicide she's <UNK> a year later she's out has a new boyfriend named hank joseph lawrence and is about to spend spring break with hank and four other mindless friends in a big beautiful <UNK> in florida naturally the killer pops up for no reason and starts killing again br br lousy slasher thriller a <UNK> example of how not to do a low budget horror movie for starters large portions of this film are endless filler of these six idiots <UNK> themselves having fun more fun than the audience getting drunk acting stupid etc etc also there is no nudity in here at all i'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but anything to <UNK> this up would have helped none of the deaths are really shown you hear them are only a little bloody and there is no gore there's one real gruesome one but that's not till the end br br with a few exceptions the acting sucks <UNK> barton is dreadful as the main woman and tom jay jones is lousy as oz <UNK> allen pops up as brad and he's terrible lawrence is actually very good handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all and jeff <UNK> pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job br br logic <UNK> abound after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex <UNK> non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and what happens to lawrence his character disappears without a trace at the end dull stupid no gore no nudity skip this one
<START> this film was the worst film i have ever viewed it was like a <UNK> assignment for a film class it totally misses the mark when it comes to the message it is trying to <UNK> characters are over exaggerated poor acting and as for a plot well it is utterly ridiculous the cover shot is what made me think it may be a decent film the co actor is handsome and that's about it moral of this movie never judge a movie by it's cover save your time money and energy and make your own home movie and you will be far better off than i it was painful to watch and quite frankly i am surprised that anyone would spend money to make and <UNK> it
<START> this british spanish co production is one of the countless films shot in spain in the wake of the unexpected phenomenal success enjoyed by the italian spaghetti westerns and as is typical of such genre efforts features an <UNK> assortment of established and <UNK> international stars robert shaw telly <UNK> stella stevens martin <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> michael craig al <UNK> dudley <UNK> antonio <UNK> etc ironically however this incoherent mess of a movie serves as a shining example as to why that most american of film genres became a dying breed in the 1970s and is nowadays practically or is that officially <UNK> br br i really wanted to like this film not only because the western is one of my favorite types of movies but also because it had all the qualities including an intriguing premise to be a good one not to mention the fact that my father had purchased a <UNK> edition of a town called <UNK> <UNK> following its original release as it is the film's sole virtue if indeed it can even be called that is its sheer <UNK> for instance stevens playing a widow out for revenge on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband sleeps inside a coffin driven around in a <UNK> by her dumb <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a blood <UNK> <UNK> who at first appears to be the film's main villain is <UNK> <UNK> by his own henchman <UNK> very early on in the picture the villain of the piece then turns out to be <UNK> who in the film's very first scene is seen <UNK> side by side our legendary hero turned priest shaw <UNK> <UNK> playing a blind <UNK> is the only one who can identify rebel shaw who in the end turns out to have been merely a front for well <UNK> as you can see the plot is very confusing and it gets stranger from there the production team responsible for this film were also behind other western fare around the same period of time like <UNK> of the west 1967 bad man's river 1971 captain <UNK> 1971 and <UNK> villa 1972
<START> wow what can i say i like <UNK> movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick but snake eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance <UNK> lamas <UNK> more like <UNK> <UNK> this guy has as much acting ability as bill <UNK> has self control it has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse crazed <UNK> yep needless <UNK> shot with a real weird <UNK> yep crappy soundtrack yep i wish i could give the movie 10 stars but 1 is as low as it goes seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real the worse thing there is <UNK> snake eater movies guess its in demand
<START> i really really love this show i have always liked the 1990's shows of space ghost this show was hilarious and i can't believe why cartoon <UNK> adult swim would take such a funny show like this off the air i hope they put this show on dvd or something the show is about <UNK> from the space ghost cartoons <UNK> and cartoon planet who lives his every day life with his mom and dad and his best friend who likes to drop in a lot <UNK> my favorite episodes were the one where <UNK> gets this really good singing voice and then his voice doesn't give him any money that <UNK> made from singing at all another episode i like is the one where <UNK> and <UNK> didn't finish their <UNK> and then they go back from sunday to friday and they just goof off and then they go back to the day <UNK> was invented and then when they go back to the present <UNK> didn't exist another episode i like is the one where <UNK> dad and their next door neighbor <UNK> the robot keep getting into this <UNK> and then they get eaten by a giant worm another episode i liked was the one where <UNK> makes a bully stand and then some new guy took over his stand i also like a lot of the other episodes one thing that never fails to make me laugh is when <UNK> is getting beaten up <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> i had just watched one episode of this program and i couldn't even get to the end of the program every minute i had watched this program my i q must of dropped about 10 points this is basically like a children's program but with swearing not even the swearing and the insults she tells other people made me laugh anyways the story must of been written by a monkey and the people who actually put this script for this program through for filming must of been held at gun point and had no choice but to film this retarded disappointing horribly acted program sarah <UNK> should use the little money she actually made from this program and get some god damn acting lessons
<START> the french <UNK> brothers did something nobody else did they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened they were in building 2 when you could see papers <UNK> down people hitting the ground from jumping from such a height br br i mean it goes as far as when both buildings <UNK> they went running their camera was still running when the white dust covered them they found a shop <UNK> and got inside but all this footage is real and i think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us br br ten stars goes to the <UNK> brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that i watch every 9 11 so i'll never forget what this country went through i believe if i remember right it shows the first death of the priest of the <UNK> while he was being carried to the church and his honorable funeral
<START> <UNK> from this portuguese guy br br i believe the sopranos are one of the best production ever it has reality and fiction mixed in such a way that it's hard to see the difference it has the same quality as godfather james gandolfini fits at the paper as a <UNK> i would love the sopranos would never finish at all it's perfect it should be a subject in school i saw sopranos when i was a kid but i was too young to stay <UNK> until the episode ends so now i bought the all episodes in dvd format and i am watching all episodes at home before and after dinner and i am getting addicted like i did with prison break in my opinion prison break and the sopranos are the best ever series made for television the argument of both are splendid and the actors are perfect <UNK> for such a work br br sorry about my english thanks for reading
<START> i sought out this film for one reason al <UNK> he is among the worst directors of all time right up there with ed wood jr and ray dennis <UNK> and the <UNK> of awfulness however i was a tad disappointed because although the film was indeed bad it never approached the levels of awfulness of some of his earlier <UNK> movies because of that this film wasn't particularly fun to watch for us bad movie fans br br now i was <UNK> about watching this film as the title naughty <UNK> makes the film sound like a pornographic film something i wouldn't be reviewing on imdb however this film appeared to be this at times particularly the first 10 minutes but you could tell that the script <UNK> many changes as for much of the film there isn't any <UNK> at all and towards the end of the movie there is a plot that comes out of no where that is violent and certainly not sexy the result of all this is total confusion br br sadly none of the many parts are even good for example as a porn video it shows surprisingly little and it's incomprehensible why they would put a <UNK> year old guy in some of the love scenes sure for a <UNK> year old mr <UNK> looked pretty good but he was still an old man and no one would want to see him getting it on with young <UNK> then when the final 20 minutes becomes very violent as <UNK> became a rambo like guy talk about weird and inappropriate br br overall there is little to recommend this sad movie it's not bad enough or sexy enough to care about and the film manages to be rather boring even with such a crazy title like naughty <UNK>
<START> this mindless movie is a piece of crap and boring like the full house <UNK> for all the people who want to see a great exciting and cool horror movie shouldn't even think about watching this bunch of mindless work a f in my opinion i have one question what were they thinking let's make a list 1 bad script 2 bad script 3 bad script 4 bad acting 5 bad directing and last but not least a bad script i mean i am not like <UNK> about every movie but i was disappointed when i watched it this movie should be banned into a box locked and sunk down into the sea so please don't do something like this again please please please
<START> anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies this movie was an insult to watch the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography the blair witch project had better cinematography and i hate that move with a passion the storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination okay thats all good and fine but they still could have done better things with this script than what they did i mean come on the indian in the store did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the indian and the entire story about an indian spirit called wendigo which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here so you think okay creepy ghost scenario but then she just <UNK> for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy that was so lame it goes beyond pathetic the ending left you wondering not only what happened to <UNK> in the hospital but also with the feeling of <UNK> why the hell did i just waste my time watching this this is a move that i recommend not to watch there are definitely better quality films out there that won't insult your intelligence thank god i never had to pay to see this movie i would have <UNK> my money back for those that were easily entertained by this movie it's very sad that you <UNK> your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie
<START> i love eddie izzard i think this is awesome and the other television <UNK> should be looked at as well he has a good book dress to kill out to buy as well which i think people should read i loved that this program won an emmy and anyone who likes history will probably get a laugh from eddie enjoy
<START> i grew up watching this series i was about seven eight years old when it was on i still remember the 1st episode which was called the new house it scared the h ll out of me i can almost still hear that statue laughing <UNK> and the ending oh my god the <UNK> spirit comes in the room for the child <UNK> this was classic tv and it was a one of a kind series i have found a dvd collection for sale on the internet 2 actually my question to any readers has anyone purchased this set its a <UNK> both sellers claim to have very good copy i have a <UNK> and poor dvd of the new house episode and a couple of other episodes that are a bit better however if anyone knows if these are much <UNK> it would be worth it to me to buy and share with my kids a great series clever scary and <UNK> supernatural thanks in advance to any fans who have the low down on any of this in fact i'd love to discuss it chris walker
<START> starts really well nice intro and build up for the main characters but after about 5 minutes the charm is lost br br the character is in the same <UNK> as the main protagonist from american pie and loser without the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the pie movies more of a commercial success br br let's be honest <UNK> acting was pretty poor keaton daniels and <UNK> did their best but had no substantial plot or script to get their teeth into the movie just <UNK> on without any pace or clear logical storyline <UNK> its length br br the ending is about as predictable as they come so predictable i've <UNK> the spoilers box for this one line br br my advice avoid at all costs unless you really really have nothing else to do listen to or watch and even then you'll feel the producers just cheated you out of an hour and a half of your life
<START> i've seen this film several times in a variety of short film festivals and it always causes me the impression that i have seen a movie trailer br br for a school film is very well produced and directed but the story well it needed something else to be a bigger and interesting film the character named tim watcher needed some in <UNK> approach this is something that lacks in some portuguese short films the script is always superficial br br but still i liked this movie br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> deathstalker is perfect for b fantasy movie fans this barely 80 minute travesty of film making features everything <UNK> can ask for non existent plotting terrible acting save for at least a <UNK> sounding old lady laughable scripting and schlock editing and bargain basement style background settings there are no characters that come across as likable or interesting in particular the lead doesn't have anything appealing about him and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the f grade material if that's not enough then how about the lack of a compelling plot which this movie has nothing of the sort to make deathstalker qualify as a major turkey i was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to 1 be topless and or scantily clad 2 get raped 3 have sex with the hero 4 all of the above in addition the background music is hideous a bizarre mess of electronic noise cheesy <UNK> bursts and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with <UNK> a thing to keep one interested deathstalker is probably best suited for folks looking for something to laugh at and believe me there's plenty of that in here otherwise i do not recommend this <UNK> grade conan wanna be to anyone in the least
<START> bruce almighty looks and sounds incredibly stupid especially from the trailers nevertheless i found in it a deeper message that actually made me like this film more bruce jim carrey is angry at god and is given divine powers by him to be god for a week to see if he can do a better job morgan freeman plays a man <UNK> here as god and though it isn't his usual type of film or one of his best roles he does excellent with what he is given to work with although crude at times the film does have quite a few laughs from bruce <UNK> his soup in half like the red sea and the <UNK> reactions to him as well as <UNK> seemingly laid back and <UNK> image of god it is overly exaggerated at times and there is some crude humor but overall it manages to be somewhat funny there is a decent supporting cast such as jennifer aniston lisa ann walter and steve <UNK> which always helps the end of the film proves to be very romantic and tear <UNK> and the message is clear that we should do what god has called us to do and be the miracle the film is far from perfect but still enjoyable and far better than i and many people probably would have expected especially if we see the deeper message of the film br br out of
<START> when i first read <UNK> <UNK> story i was taken in by the human drama displayed by gabriel no one and those he cares about and loves that being said we have now been given the film version of an excellent story and are expected to see past the <UNK> of hollywood br br writer <UNK> <UNK> and director patrick <UNK> have truly succeeded br br with just the right amount of restraint robin williams captures the fragile essence of gabriel and lets us see his struggle with issues of trust both in his <UNK> life jess and the world around him donna br br as we are introduced to the players in this drama we are reminded that nothing is ever as it seems and that the smallest event can change our lives <UNK> the request to review a book written by a young man turns into a life changing event that helps gabriel find the strength within himself to carry on and move forward br br it's to bad that most people will avoid this film i only say that because the average american will probably think robin williams in a serious role that didn't work before please give this movie a chance robin williams touches the darkness we all must find and go through in ourselves to be better people like his movie one hour photo he has stepped up as an actor and made another quality piece of art br br oh and before i forget i believe bobby <UNK> as jess steals every scene he is in he has the 1940's leading man looks and screen presence it's this <UNK> opinion he could carry his own movie right now br br s
<START> from a plot and movement standpoint this movie was terrible i found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and <UNK> after 80 long minutes that it mercifully did basically five characters appear in the movie a son father son's girl friend and two male characters of the son's age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation the movie and scenes seemed to suggest <UNK> <UNK> but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another there were a couple of brilliant scenes at the beginning of the movie the son's girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation the photography and acting <UNK> an incredible <UNK> to the interaction between the two ending with her <UNK> to having another man who was older end of that story
<START> reading the various <UNK> reviews of roger ebert and other well known film critics makes me hesitate to admit how much i love this movie even though i only have a dubbed into japanese video version of it br br apparently many critics seem to take it as a minus that the story premise has been used before most <UNK> in the very great it's a wonderful life to me a great premise is a great premise no matter how many times it's used and i'd be happy to see more movies using this particular premise the <UNK> man who gets a chance to gain a fresh perspective on his own life through a bit of divine magic br br i suppose folks and critics of a more intellectual bent are not as pulled into the story but i don't go to movies to critique them with <UNK> in hand i go to movies to throw myself into them and let them take me where they will br br if you are sentimental sort like myself you'll be well rewarded by seeing this picture the performances are excellent throughout and the movie was very well cast wonderful choice of music too michael caine is superb as the sympathetic bartender jim belushi does a great job as an average joe kind of guy who wonders if his life hasn't gone as it should linda hamilton always excellent is again right on target here as the loving wife jon <UNK> entertains as usual and even has some surprisingly moving moments in mr destiny br br no mr destiny is not it's a wonderful life but who says it has to be taken on its own terms mr destiny is an enjoyable well made funny and moving film i've seen my japanese dubbed video of it numerous times and i'm sure i'll see it several more times if that somehow makes me a <UNK> so be it i'm just glad that i hadn't read any reviews of mr destiny before seeing it br br i suppose i should have the courage of my <UNK> and give the movie nine or ten stars but i couldn't help but doubt myself after reading all the critical reviews
<START> this film is very creepy indeed unfortunately not for the reasons the film makers would hope br br there's a mastermind serial killer too but he's not what's creepy either he's just your standard comic book villain a cross between <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> though with nothing particularly fresh to add to either incidentally for even the <UNK> and most <UNK> of criminals can they be <UNK> <UNK> in a stress position on their feet arms <UNK> 24 hours a day week in week out i suppose in the world that gave us abu <UNK> and <UNK> bay <UNK> possible br br no what's really creepy about this film is the central character danny this unappealing young man aided and <UNK> it's true by some <UNK> <UNK> security <UNK> and a doctor entirely <UNK> of any notion of professional <UNK> or patient <UNK> wanders into the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as a highly vulnerable and <UNK> young woman and on the basis of nothing whatsoever her <UNK> sleeping <UNK> from being able to give anything like informed <UNK> <UNK> himself to have some sort of special relationship with her br br seemingly within days he has <UNK> to himself the right to <UNK> her believing completely <UNK> as we discover that he is better able to care for her than anyone else and within minutes of getting her back to his apartment is sexually <UNK> her though she is again due to her <UNK> entirely unable to <UNK> or resist br br our <UNK> as to why he would feel this connection are pretty soon confirmed he is of course more or less unable to form any mature adult friendships let alone sexual relationships so instead falls back on this essentially <UNK> woman who because of her permanent sleeping has a mental age <UNK> to a lived experience of only a few years the scene where she discovers ice cream is particularly cringe making and the <UNK> knowing look she gives him when he <UNK> says he'll have to clean her up again causes a particular <UNK> of horror but again i'm afraid not that <UNK> of horror the film makers were hoping for but a much more straightforward <UNK> of <UNK> we can all see clearly what's on the end of our <UNK> here it's the <UNK> perfect dream of innocence sexual <UNK> and utter <UNK> horrible horrible horrible br br what else have we got in this <UNK> mash twisted <UNK> not quite as good as del toro the <UNK> you need to go to the police argument where the lead character always has a reason for not doing so even though it's the only sensible course of action the <UNK> sequence much praised in the comments here though completely and utterly pointless it serves no function as <UNK> weaver <UNK> <UNK> in galaxy quest and looking to me just like the <UNK> doctor <UNK> <UNK> in one of the saw <UNK> br br jeffrey combs does his best though so a star for that and a couple more because you have to keep lower <UNK> for films that are even worse than this and in general this is well shot and competently performed
<START> this movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original i suppose which is really sad because at a deeper level the title <UNK> <UNK> the original is so ironic i'm sure it wasn't intended that way but the original was filmed in 1970 and released in 1971 the real <UNK> <UNK> was the end of an era which pretty much ended in the early 1970s br br in this remake all the counter cultural elements have been stripped away and been rendered more pc in an attempt to reach a <UNK> audience presumably <UNK> for your protection br br <UNK> the american indian scenes was gratuitous and the idea of a <UNK> <UNK> to the trip was <UNK> by addition i'm glad i watched it however it made me appreciate the original that much more the original is a cult classic and golden this remake is dreadful
<START> this is a great small film i say small because it doesn't have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions as in a john woo film great performances by roy <UNK> and the three bad guys john <UNK> seems to have more luck with small productions these days the film is very easy to watch the story is more of a yarn than a <UNK> machine instead of everything going around and around it seems as though things just get worse as the plot <UNK> wonderful ending very positive i never read the <UNK> leonard book but it can't be much different from the film because it feels like i'm watching an <UNK> leonard movie
<START> as a teenager i was pretty into the whole bigfoot thing i read the books and followed the reported <UNK> as a more jaded adult i've largely given up on the big guy now but don't mind watching the odd movie when i come across one this one had a few strong points to it mainly the <UNK> of two of the more famous bigfoot encounters the ape canyon incident of <UNK> and the <UNK> incident of c <UNK> as related to and by teddy <UNK> both of which i'm somewhat familiar with from that youthful reading i did the movie takes for granted that both incidents involved a sasquatch whereas both incidents have more plausible explanations but the <UNK> were well done there's also homage paid at the beginning of the movie to the famous <UNK> video again taking for granted its authenticity the sasquatch encounter at the end of the movie was also very well done and had a very creepy feel to it as the sasquatch were portrayed mainly in the shadows or as hairy feet running past the terrified men unfortunately in total those four things might have composed about 20 minutes whereas the movie as a whole is slightly over an hour and a half br br it's the fictional story done in a documentary style of an expedition to a remote area of northern british columbia to the suspected home range of the sasquatch a computer had targeted this area based on <UNK> and in one of the more amusing scenes in the movie the computer also used <UNK> <UNK> to draw a picture of a sasquatch that looked exactly like the creature of the <UNK> video aside from those 20 minutes i mentioned we basically watch this expedition travel which means we get to watch a bunch of guys go on a long camping trip i've been on camping <UNK> with the guys let me tell you they've never been worthy of a movie interspersed among the long stretches of boredom are some nice <UNK> shots although one suspects that <UNK> footage was used or perhaps even captive animals performing as wild animals and there are some spectacular scenery shots except that the scenery isn't of northern british columbia it's from national parks in <UNK> br br i did appreciate that we were never given a real picture of the sasquatch so we didn't have to deal with the bad makeup that would have been part of this 3 10

<START> making the film as dark and visually fuzzy as possible in order to cover up the budget <UNK> is an often used <UNK> in low budget horror films but this one takes it too far it is so poorly lit and murky and it takes place almost entirely at night to boot that you often end up virtually looking at a black screen although perhaps the bad video transfer may also have had something to do with that alas murky is also the best word to describe the movie's plot the filmmakers throw in diverse and unoriginal horror ideas without any semblance of logic and halfway through you get the feeling that they just about abandoned the effort to make a good horror film you know it when you see characters who are supposed to be in mortal danger or in some occasions even dead making small talk 1 2
<START> this delighted audiences at a number of film festivals and it is not hard to see why director <UNK> zhang with the help of some very nice work by the three principle actors <UNK> <UNK> as the father master liu <UNK> <UNK> as the elder son da <UNK> and especially wu <UNK> as the <UNK> and lovable younger son er <UNK> <UNK> a tale that will warm the <UNK> heart br br the film starts with a man taking a shower in an <UNK> booth in the middle of <UNK> he puts some money in a <UNK> opens the door takes off his clothes and puts some of them on a <UNK> belt to be <UNK> steps into the shower and gets <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> of water and soap as though he's a car at the car wash this is the future <UNK> speaking and the old <UNK> we will see in the next scene is the past <UNK> china is giving way to industrial china br br <UNK> cultural revolution hang over <UNK> blues no way what we have here is a celebration of people and their kindness and love for one another a celebration of goodness in the hearts of men yet i wonder how the chinese government views this film on the one hand it clearly presents a pleasant view of china and its people it is <UNK> <UNK> without criticism of the present regime expressed or implied yet there is the slightest sense that the good old ways are going to be replaced by something that may not be as good i think <UNK> zhang had the wisdom to just let that be as it may tell a story about old men at the <UNK> where they get back <UNK> and <UNK> where they tell tall tales and <UNK> about the good old days where they can relax and play chinese chess and stage <UNK> fights where the master is a <UNK> and wise old guy and his assistant is his son who may be retarded or <UNK> but who does his job with glee and an <UNK> spirit of fun and good will br br enter back on the scene the older son da <UNK> who is polished well <UNK> and <UNK> he is uncomfortable with what he sees as the <UNK> behavior of his father and brother he represents modern china with his tie and his <UNK> his cell phone and his education he has only returned because he thought his father was dying when he sees that this is not true he packs his <UNK> and is set to return to his wife and his career but then a crisis ensues and it is during this crisis that da <UNK> sees the value of the natural people centered life that his father and his brother have been living br br and so <UNK> zhang <UNK> the old and the new and does so in such a charming manner that i will not object especially since his style is so neat and so carefully expressed one of the nice things he does that i miss in most movies is the way he <UNK> the subplots within the larger story so that they are resolved before the picture ends the <UNK> regular who sings o sole <UNK> in the <UNK> as the water <UNK> down upon him much to the delight of er <UNK> finds that he can't sing in public because of stage fright near the end of the film he loses his stage fright and sings thanks to some inspired help from er <UNK> and the <UNK> regular who is losing his wife because well he tells a tale to master liu before he <UNK> the real reason but liu understands and again before the movie is over husband and wife are <UNK> br br this kind of happy ending movie making is unusual in today artistic and international films or in almost any film directed at adults some happy endings are so contrived as to embarrass not only their <UNK> but their audiences and some are so blatantly condescending that the audience is offended here however the audience is delighted br br see this especially for the comedic performance by wu <UNK> whose warm <UNK> <UNK> any <UNK> his character may have
<START> <UNK> enjoy all the musical numbers each time i see this movie never seem to tire of it fred and ginger are always a pleasure to watch seeing lucy and betty <UNK> before they hit the big time is fun to watch
<START> ruth gordon at her best this episode is my favorite of the whole columbo series peter falk and ruth gordon worked so well together that they should both be <UNK> into the television hall of fame regardless of the rest of their work even the music was outstanding in this episode
<START> if i hadn't read his name on the dvd cover i never would have suspected that this rather <UNK> and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the french new wave in fact the film is so far from that that i wonder if back in the 50s and 60s new wave <UNK> would have absolutely hated this type of film it's so so unreal and it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films this isn't necessarily a bad thing just a very surprising thing br br what i also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film especially when there are so many better french musicals out there the songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical if i had to see another rich person who <UNK> about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit i was going to <UNK> br br the bottom line is that like american musicals not every french musical is gold this film is not another les <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> eight women and despite the presence of audrey <UNK> i can't see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull <UNK>
<START> there is no doubt that halloween is by far one of the best films ever not only in its genre but also outside i love the films creepy atmosphere like the whole it could happen here sort of situation makes it scary to think about also to imagine if you were ever in this situation what would you do this is a movie that i enjoy watching highly especially around halloween time john carpenter is a very professional <UNK> i love a lot of his other films but there is no doubt that his best known movie is the film halloween oh and if your thinking about watching the rob zombie remake don't it is pure crap and a true halloween fan would like the 1978 john carpenter version better michael myers is one of the coolest slasher killers in any film and is a very well known one so by all means go see this masterpiece you will really like it
<START> after the success of die hard and it's sequels it's no surprise really that in the 1990s a <UNK> of <UNK> hard on a ' movies <UNK> in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept that is what they did with cliffhanger die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly <UNK> or my mom will <UNK> <UNK> career br br cliffhanger is one big <UNK> <UNK> dream especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing base jumping <UNK> facial expressions acting skills all in all it's full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk stallone even managed to get out acted by a horse however if you an forget all the nonsense it's actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills and unintentionally plenty of laughs br br you've got to love john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> every box band of baddies and best of all the <UNK> <UNK> and hapless <UNK> agent rex <UNK> as <UNK> br br he may of been henry in <UNK> of a serial <UNK> but michael <UNK> is noteworthy for a cringe worthy performance as hal he insists on constantly <UNK> in painful disbelief at his <UNK> <UNK> man never hurt <UNK> and whilst he surely can't be it really does look like ralph <UNK> frank character is <UNK> as the girl <UNK> to her death br br mention too must go to former <UNK> <UNK> actor craig <UNK> as the brit bad guy who comes a <UNK> whilst using hal as a human football yes you can't help enjoy that bit hal needed a good kicking br br so forget your better judgement who cares if <UNK> could never <UNK> lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy and if you're looking for <UNK> he's the one wearing the helicopter
<START> highly memorable intelligent and suspenseful movie from one of french <UNK> true geniuses the <UNK> able <UNK> <UNK> the plot is an exact parallel of the <UNK> assassination and takes place in a non <UNK> fictional country the film visually as well as plot wise is razor sharp shot with <UNK> <UNK> it follows henry <UNK> the <UNK> who takes on himself to unravel the coup in many ways it's a very disturbing movie not the least for the cold and <UNK> <UNK> of its comment on a so called modern <UNK> inner <UNK> the atmosphere and characters are all utterly believable and <UNK> left nothing to chance in its tight plotting on another level this relatively little known movie just had a 15 years head start on oliver stone who was acclaimed for the <UNK> movie a inferior film in many areas the least of which not being credibility br br it's a masterpiece any cinema lover should see it preferably in its original french version with <UNK>
<START> who could possibly sympathize with these two obnoxious protagonists what's intended to be a light <UNK> comedy about neighbor children who can't give up their childhood game of dare even as they age well into <UNK> comes off more as an exercise in cruelty and <UNK> self <UNK> as children the pair are <UNK> <UNK> as adults they're <UNK> immature it's a bad combination
<START> i heard about this movie when watching <UNK> 100 most metal moments on the segment gene simmons who played a cameo and several other <UNK> discussed how utterly awful this movie is unlike most people i'm often more curious about checking out movies that have <UNK> for being ridiculously bad than say a masterpiece of cinema the advantage of having that sort of attitude is half the time i find out that the movies are nowhere near as bad as people said and i end up enjoying them a lot more than i initially expected that was my experience with trick or treat now it's hard to make a movie about a teenage boy who receives messages from a dead heavy metal star by playing one of his vintage records backwards without people <UNK> at the premise sure it's certainly a strange premise but one that's never been done before give the filmmakers points for originality for <UNK> sake if you're looking to buy the dvd having no prior knowledge of the movie don't be fooled into thinking <UNK> <UNK> and gene simmons are the stars however though simmons has a <UNK> role <UNK> does have a funny cameo as a <UNK> that's right a <UNK> who speaks out against heavy metal for one thing it's funny seeing <UNK> with short hair and for another thing you can't help but laugh at the irony sure it's a cheap shot but an effective one the acting is pretty good i found the performances convincing the teen characters are horribly clichéd so expect the usual array of <UNK> and <UNK> and like in every one of these movies the pretty girl is a decent person who has sympathy for the <UNK> main character yet continues to go out with her jock boyfriend <UNK> she going out with such a complete jerk in the first place because the plot needs an <UNK> no other reason but i can't deny that one of my guilty pleasures is watching the evil <UNK> in these movies go down since i was an <UNK> in high school the movie kept my interest for the most part but the third act is way too conventional and caused me to roll my eyes as there would be one predictable situation after another but altogether the film is not at all bad and definitely worth viewing on a rainy day 7 out of 10
<START> this adaptation of m r <UNK> short story 'a view from a <UNK> was first shown on british television in 2005 on the little watched digital channel bbc 4 i saw that it was being repeated again on bbc 4 and decided to give it a go remembering the <UNK> successful 1970's adaptations of other m r james stories including <UNK> and i'll come to you my <UNK> and 'the <UNK> though not in the same class as these masterpieces 'a view from a <UNK> is nonetheless an enjoyable and at times suspenseful drama br br a <UNK> arrives in a small rural village to look over the collection of a recently deceased collector of <UNK> <UNK> whilst out in the countryside he sees an <UNK> that has been in ruins for hundreds of years but what does this have in connection with an old pair of <UNK> and a gruesome legend about the <UNK> named <UNK> hill and what do the <UNK> country <UNK> and his servant know about the situation whilst not scary in any way i enjoyed this little production and had the running time been longer than 40 minutes it could have become a truly great adaptation as it is it all feels a little rushed and a bit more exposition to set the mood would have been welcome br br i give it 7 out of 10
<START> i actually prefer robin williams in his more serious roles e g good will hunting the fisher king the world according to <UNK> these are my favorite robin williams movies but <UNK> the day although well acted is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and certainly the worst robin williams movie even worse than death to <UNK> club paradise and <UNK> on ice br br every good story is going to have its ups and downs this movie however is one giant down i don't need a feel good hollywood cheese fest but i've got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter <UNK> this movie reminds me of love <UNK> which is actually worse because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall the answer who cares
<START> this in my opinion is one of the best action movies of the 1970s it not only features a great cast but is also loaded with wild <UNK> and explosions that are still impressive today the story is about a vietnam vet kris kristofferson being <UNK> by his brother jan michael vincent to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when kris starts taking advantage of his position and becomes as bad as the criminals he was hired to get rid of it's great seeing kris play against type <UNK> <UNK> and victoria principal both offer great support as the respective ladies of the two male stars jan michael shows real movie star persona in this film i don't think vigilante force is on video but it occasionally shows up on tv it's a great flick for guys who like movies
<START> watching this again after a gap of many years and remembering the flop it was upon its original release i am surprised at how well it has held up one of the reasons for its failure was that one generation just thought it was over indulgent crap and a younger one was disappointed that it did not show the full <UNK> glory seen now it is clear that antonioni was already aware of and fascinated by the <UNK> mix of <UNK> enthusiasm for change and a lack of any clear vision for the future the lead pair are excellent and it is shameful that they took so much <UNK> for the film's perceived failure they are ideal and convey perfectly the various <UNK> and demonstrate a pure delight in <UNK> i blame others for the over emphasis on the student revolt sequences at the start but have to say that from there on in this is one of the directors most beautiful looking pictures and he certainly got the very best out of the man made and natural landscapes oh and i haven't even mentioned the highly explosive ending
<START> in paris the shy and insecure <UNK> <UNK> roman polanski <UNK> an old apartment without bathroom where the previous tenant the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> committed suicide the <UNK> <UNK> shelley winters and the tough <UNK> mr <UNK> melvyn douglas establish <UNK> rules of behavior and <UNK> feels ridden by his neighbors meanwhile he visits <UNK> in the hospital and befriends her girlfriend stella isabelle <UNK> after the death of <UNK> <UNK> feels obsessed for her and believes his <UNK> and neighbors are plotting a scheme to force him to also commit suicide br br the weird le <UNK> is a disturbing and creepy tale of paranoia and <UNK> the story and the process of madness and loss of identity of the lonely <UNK> are slowly developed in a nightmarish atmosphere in the gruesome location of his apartment and what is happening indeed is totally unpredictable the performances are awesome and isabelle <UNK> is extremely beautiful my vote is eight br br title brazil o <UNK> the tenant
<START> patrick <UNK> jeff <UNK> is a <UNK> of satan serial killer who possesses the first power even after being captured by detective russell logan lou diamond phillips and executed in the gas chamber he is able to move his spirit from body to body and continue to murder at will with the help of attractive psychic tess <UNK> tracy griffith <UNK> g 's half sister he attempts to stop <UNK> br br this concept probably had some possibilities i think but ultimately the first power suffers from routine scripting and film making this is nothing we haven't seen before sometimes done better there is nothing about this movie to <UNK> it from other supernatural horror thrillers more to the point it's not very thrilling and it certainly isn't scary phillips is a hard sell as a tough as nails cynical cop stereotype and griffith doesn't seem to be trying very hard best cast member is probably the <UNK> featured <UNK> doing his best to be <UNK> creepy br br the climax is rather silly and the ending very weak br br not really even acceptable enough to rate as an average film of its kind therefore br br 4 10
<START> the bittersweet twist to this movie contains a wonderful element of <UNK> that evokes an <UNK> passion these characteristics of idealistic imagery which moonstruck possesses <UNK> on an end result of a <UNK> thumbs up verdict by virtually every prominent critic in hollywood let me describe the circumstances to this film simply put they are <UNK> moonstruck is a cohesive film which sparks the <UNK> of an old italian neighborhood in new york city new york city has always been one big melting pot that is <UNK> by many <UNK> some mannerisms which are <UNK> of typical new <UNK> this includes a lot of italian americans living in new york as well the mid and late eighties brought on an abrupt conclusion to many strong <UNK> with various cultural stereotypes <UNK> <UNK> was a firmly <UNK> <UNK> in american history that was far more prevalent several generations before this movie was made these <UNK> <UNK> still exist today however they are more <UNK> and less <UNK> for this italian family of a <UNK> era confusion <UNK> <UNK> and yes of course love all have the comical <UNK> of an utterly human understanding to them the <UNK> spirits with everyone in moonstruck seems to be that of <UNK> individual <UNK> one might wonder about cher playing the lead role as she is more known as an entertainer than a big box office first billing star in a movie in moonstruck however i think she was incredibly well suited to her role and came off as thoroughly believable in a relatively unbelievable situation all of the characters in moonstruck are very rough around the edges really tough and not afraid to have a <UNK> duel with <UNK> the most hilarious aspect to their lives is <UNK> and they are thoroughly aware of the fact that <UNK> the storm definitely serves a <UNK> purpose i thought the acting in this movie was sensational all relationships in this movie garner an <UNK> potential to vividly <UNK> because everybody knows how everybody else's basic nature is really like for this family nothing is glamorous nothing is <UNK> romantic and nothing is overly emotional just moderately so the fact is this entire family is <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and overcome by an extremely <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in all of their lives taking moon <UNK> literally can indeed have a pleasantly <UNK> impact on one's resolve <UNK> <UNK> and resistance to the proverbial am <UNK> thus <UNK> everything the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in this film is basically one of be honest get angry be honest get <UNK> be honest get distorted and <UNK> most importantly be honest and fall in love this is <UNK> best performance ever as an actress nicholas cage danny aiello and olympia dukakis were wonderfully flawed in moonstruck such performances by these three were perfectly appropriate for the <UNK> energy of the characters in this movie director norman <UNK> famous for <UNK> kid thomas <UNK> affair and most famous for in the heat of the night which won the academy award for best picture in 1967 depicts many keen and <UNK> instincts in the process of <UNK> the deliberate <UNK> to this film i am italian american in descent partially anyways cher is not italian and for that matter neither is the writer nor the director i guess since non italians like eating our food they may as well use our culture to make a fabulous film too it is refreshing to know that a film can be marvelous and have an incredibly happy ending for those of you who didn't like this movie i just have one thing to say snap out of it this movie moonstruck is totally happy go lucky totally eighties and totally five stars see it
<START> <UNK> takes a little getting used to at first but the final result is very satisfying the tale about a murderous samurai who seeks to redeem himself by <UNK> an <UNK> but dangerous samurai is worth more than a watch there is a lot at stake here from physical survival to <UNK> salvation the movie may seem a bit similar to other anime inspired samurai film at first but it does eventually delve into more mature adult territory soon after br br not to be missed <UNK> is one of the better samurai movies to come around post kurosawa br br 8 out of 10 br br go to www <UNK> com for a more detailed review of the movie and reviews of other foreign films
<START> anyone who loved the two classic novels by edward <UNK> will be disappointed in this film all the magic and romance have been <UNK> out of his original story of a girl who does a good deed for a mysterious old lady and given three in return three what not three wishes but three rides into the <UNK> on a <UNK> elevator br br the first novel is time at the top the second is all in good time
<START> i read somewhere that hollywood should concentrate on <UNK> bad movies and leave the classics alone we can only hope while this remake wasn't a total waste i still wish i had the six bucks back to go toward a dvd of the original lots of violence and one of the worst endings i've ever seen this version doesn't add anything new it only <UNK> why hollywood should leave the good stuff alone
<START> i know no one cares but i do this film is historic for one reason it is the <UNK> of two heroes from two great seventies sci fi films well one is great and one is quite bad the great one is truly great in fact it's the best the bad one is truly bad in fact it's the worst of course of the great i refer to star wars and it's star mark <UNK> aka luke skywalker who is the hero of this film about a kid who gets his <UNK> <UNK> and then goes to vegas on a lead and after a whole lot of adventures eventually <UNK> it since he's into <UNK> cars i guess you can call him <UNK> skywalker along the way he meets a hooker with a heart of gold and ends up facing off with a character played by kim <UNK> the hero from the seventies sci fi cult film <UNK> which is as i've hinted at earlier the worst sci fi film ever made <UNK> plays the lead baddie whom <UNK> must steal his car back from i realize that no one cares about this meeting of two great sci fi heroes but i do and i also must say that this is one of the best worst movies of all time mark <UNK> acting needs the force the plot needs extensive jedi training and the character of the hooker played by annie <UNK> just might be the most annoying character of all time ever in any film i've ever seen but it's a fun movie to watch on a weekend day or a <UNK> night late at night very late it's one of those films that <UNK> looking for something but without quite finding it and yet at the same time it's entire purpose is like free form jazz to simply exist as is and it does and what is isn't that great but you can't say it isn't entertaining because for an hour and a half you might feel ripped off but you won't feel cheated so turn off your mind relax and enjoy this muddled gem without any expectations and may the force be with you always
<START> this movie was horrible i could barely stay awake through it i would never see this movie again if i were <UNK> to the so called horror scenes in it were <UNK> predictable and over played there was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the 7 50 i <UNK> to see it don't go see it don't rent it don't read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time sarah michelle <UNK> gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for <UNK> her good name with this movie shame on you sarah for being associated with this horrible horrible movie horrible movie no need to ever see it
<START> this movie is a terrible waste of time although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to 4 i have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose this is also a horror film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight my friend and i laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared br br the only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries it cannot be that high in demand br br the <UNK> nicole petty should stick to <UNK> because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie half of the time she is british and half the time she is american
<START> i am a college student studying a levels and need help and comments from anyone who has any views at all about the theme of mothers in film in the mother whether you have gone through something similar or just want to comment and help me research more about this film any comment would much greatly appreciated the comments will be used solely for <UNK> purposes and will be included in my written <UNK> so if you have any views at all im sure i can put them to use and you could help me get an a i am also studying <UNK> a <UNK> and <UNK> so if you have seen these films as well i would appreciate it if you could leave comments on here on that page thank you
<START> this film is pure <UNK> <UNK> it is based upon a novel called <UNK> too narrow  not too <UNK> by richard sale which may or may not have been interesting it would take research to find out the story in the film takes for granted many incidents and much background which obviously existed in the novel but are nowhere to be seen in the film so either the film was <UNK> cut or the screenplay was a mess from the start there is not one <UNK> in this film which is remotely realistic either in terms of events or characters it is pure hollywood fantasy in every respect two well known actors paul lukas and peter lorre are so under used and wasted that there was no point in their being in the film at all they must have been thrown into the mix in the manner in which one adds a <UNK> of chopped <UNK> to an <UNK> hoping that the <UNK> will be enhanced the film is a <UNK> attempt at producing a <UNK> <UNK> and is so corny that it is laughable the story concerns some hardened criminals imprisoned in french <UNK> who want to escape from their french colonial prison through a jungle very much a hollywood set jungle with a rubber snake naturally there has to be a woman in the story so joan crawford <UNK> it up as a down on her luck tramp who for some reason becomes irresistible to clark gable one of the escaped criminals crawford in escaping through the jungle wears high <UNK> shoes and keeps her makeup fresh gable <UNK> and <UNK> and makes <UNK> expressions <UNK> his brow as was his wont <UNK> and looking <UNK> at everybody which was his manner of acting it is hard to treat such a character as a hardened criminal when he is always trying so hard to be clark gable that surely he hasn't any time left to be a thief attention <UNK> are by definition too busy to steal and <UNK> to a task which requires that people not see them the whole <UNK> is so ridiculous that it can only be regarded as light entertainment an attempt at <UNK> and <UNK> is made by <UNK> into the story a mysterious <UNK> of <UNK> who <UNK> walks into the prison and pretends to be an <UNK> he helps in the escape and <UNK> all the criminals and <UNK> to their various deaths helping them to find <UNK> in their last <UNK> this character is played very well by ian hunter who <UNK> throughout a convincing air of secret knowledge smiles <UNK> makes <UNK> <UNK> remarks and has a small spot trained on his face to give him a heavenly glow the theme is meant to be redemption you might call it the donald duck version of <UNK> goes moral and gets <UNK> for real depth hitchcock's 'i <UNK> of 1953 shows how it should really be done by contrast this piece of trivial nonsense shows just how bare the <UNK> of meaning were in <UNK> town and that when they went <UNK> for something that might mean something all they could come up with was you guessed it more <UNK>
<START> damn straight this show was kick ass back in the day and still continues to <UNK> cartoons today i can't wait to track down some of the dvd's to share with my little guy and see the same <UNK> in his eyes i've already introduced him to <UNK> the 5 lions one not the 15 vehicles one and i laughed my head off when he said to me one day dad you sure watched some awesome cartoons when you were a kid how cool is that br br come on hollywood dust this one off and give it a live action attempt couldn't be any worse than <UNK> 3 was man oh man 2007 has been pretty lame so far for summer movies br br ok i'll <UNK> now br br cheers
<START> i picked up this movie in the hope it would be similar to the hilarious the <UNK> by dead gentlemen productions which is highly <UNK> by the way boy what a disappointment the movie is shot in this fake documentary style made famous by the office but it fails to deliver the reason is partly the stiff acting but mostly the writing and directing true it can be funny to use every <UNK> cliché there is about role playing games but here it is done in such a way that it becomes extremely predictable already at the beginning of each scene you know what the joke will be about but maybe the biggest problem is that everything is depicted way over the top there is no subtlety in this movie if there would be <UNK> laugh now or a cheap 80s style fake laughter track it would not make much difference with some scenes you can't help to think <UNK> i get why they thought this would be funny but the way it is executed takes all momentum out of the possible joke
<START> <UNK> remake is no good at all i only click on his remake documentary to see <UNK> <UNK> the original actress back in the classic 1948 film say a few words to the crew we are going to meet <UNK> <UNK> this sunday 28 3 <UNK> after the showing of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the hong kong film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is almost 90 years old in silver hair her cameo appearance in hong kong films is always a surprise to her fans in this year's hong kong film festival a special program is dedicated to <UNK> <UNK> director of this epic movie and <UNK> <UNK> still shot from the movie is being seen all around in hong kong my son who turns 21 this year is surprised <UNK> <UNK> was so beautiful then

<START> this movie is made for asian chinese market <UNK> particularly fans of jay <UNK> one of the biggest music star in asian br br jay <UNK> is a very talented song writer singer he is mediocre as an actor although he did appear in several big budget productions initial d curse of the golden flower amazingly he won both golden horse <UNK> and hong kong film awards for initial d br br the supporting cast are very well chosen which appeals basically everyone from china the cast including many famous movie tv actors singers even sport <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from china however they were not given enough time to show their talents br br the biggest mistake is that <UNK> took over both director and writer position he has a reputation of making shallow and brainless movies based off non coherent scripts with his poor directing and <UNK> story the whole talented cast fancy vision effects and tones of production money was wasted br br however the terrible movie successfully <UNK> in over 10 million dollars maybe even more in asian which made this one of the biggest box office success in asian br br the bottom line is you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are wasted or if you are simply accompanying your kids who are fans of jay <UNK>
<START> it wasn't the most pointless animation film experience ever but it certainly can't be admired as much as it tries to be good combining <UNK> animation and computer graphics this is the story of a <UNK> later named spirit matt damon providing the first person narration and his journey through across the <UNK> of the old west basically he is born free amongst all the other horses in the beautiful countryside then he is kidnapped to be used as a <UNK> horse he manages to throw off all who try to ride him however when he escapes his cage along with little creek daniel <UNK> the two of them form a friendship oh and he obviously has a thing for little <UNK> female horse in the end after a few more escapes being chased by the colonel james <UNK> and his men and making a final big leap across a <UNK> little creek lets spirit go and he also releases his female horse and they run home to their countryside and fellow horses also starring <UNK> <UNK> as sgt adams jeff <UNK> as murphy <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> as soldier richard <UNK> as bill and matthew <UNK> as joe i was expecting to see the horses talk in this film but it turns out to be more like a <UNK> thing throughout and the songs by bryan adams aren't the most engaging but it isn't a terrible film it was nominated the oscar for best animated feature and it was nominated the golden globe for best song for bryan <UNK> here i am okay
<START> in my opinion this is a good example of the movie that could have been much better if it had been short 10 years earlier i doubt it would benefit from modern <UNK> but it would have looked much better if it was at least 90 minutes instead of 70 br br the artists and animated did a great job in my opinion this movie can <UNK> the best background art and one of the best character design animation are extremely smooth and realistic for the duration of the movie you believe in the world you see so everyone did a great job it can also <UNK> one of the <UNK> female animated characters if not the <UNK> that <UNK> typical anime girls with ease br br unfortunately there are a couple of bad <UNK> about this movie that will make it not so appealing at the moment first the plot and execution is comparable to contemporary adventure movies and is really old fashioned by modern standards second due to the duration time it would benefit a lot from extra 20 minutes of dialogs finally the setting is not so popular at the moment br br conclusion a great alternative to another short story about conan the barbarian but not to a novel
<START> this movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a 12 year old kid in <UNK> when it was shown on a los angeles television <UNK> late show the characters are very engaging from the start of the picture and it is too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape nor is it ever shown on television apparently due to a <UNK> by the estate of moss hart the playwright producer director who wrote the story and first presented it on the new york stage during wwii the reason for denying its showing is hard to <UNK> more than 50 years after it was made i did not see the movie again for over 30 years when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a <UNK> copy on vhs poor video quality but good audio my memory of it was correct it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch an amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars just starting out in their careers at the time 1944 went on to became either major motion picture stars or at least well known and fully employed actors e g judy <UNK> <UNK> o'brien <UNK> <UNK> barry nelson don taylor karl malden peter <UNK> hayes george superman reeves red buttons lee j <UNK> kevin mccarthy and gary <UNK> the scenes with the b 24 <UNK> are terrific especially the close up shots where the details of the giant for those times 4 engine <UNK> then 18 000 <UNK> now nearly <UNK> can be seen good insight into the different levels of training that a pilot <UNK> went through on his way to being assigned to a <UNK> crew of course very gender biased as was the trend of the day only the men became pilots the women just supported them in their roles hardly acceptable in today's world i hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy
<START> in 1993 the <UNK> was an enormous hit in france so the sequence was inevitable and unfortunately this sequence ranks among the worst ones ever made br br this is a movie that doesn't keep its promises indeed it's supposed to tell a sole story jean reno must go in the <UNK> century and take christian <UNK> back in the middle ages so that time can normally follow its course the problem is that <UNK> feels completely at ease in the world of the <UNK> century and so make him get back in the <UNK> ages is rather hard instead of this the movie goes on several other stories without <UNK> in following the main plot as a consequence the movie becomes sometimes <UNK> headed sometimes a bit of a mess br br but the movie also suffers from the performance of nearly all the actors reno and <UNK> fall into the trap that however they could avoid in the first movie they're going over the top and become annoying then why did jean marie <UNK> the film maker engage muriel robin in the female main role he made a mistake because she seems ill at ease and is absolutely pitiful the other actors aren't better marie anne <UNK> is nonexistent and christian <UNK> unbearable br br of course the movie contains a few good moments with efficient gags but it often falls into <UNK> and <UNK> certain sequences and dialogs are affected it also appears hollow because <UNK> takes back elements that <UNK> the success of the first movie thus a young girl takes reno for a close relative of her family and asks him to take part in her wedding br br a <UNK> and disappointing follow up anyway what's the interest of this movie otherwise commercial br br
<START> i'd have to say this is one of the best animated films i've ever seen i liked it the first time but really appreciated it on the second viewing just a few weeks ago i can see why sequel is doing such great business at the box office apparently a lot of people liked this movie br br a gorgeous color palette man this looks good and a lot of good adult but clean humor make this a big winner the opening 3 4 minute scene with <UNK> is excellent as are subsequent <UNK> with him sid the <UNK> voiced by john <UNK> however provides the main humor in the movie he usually has something funny to say throughout the movie br br ray <UNK> is the voice of the <UNK> the big character of the film literally while denis <UNK> is the <UNK> bad guy turned good <UNK> tiger br br this isn't just humor and pretty colors but a nice sentimental story of how a little baby <UNK> up a couple of tough characters this isn't interrupted with a lot of songs either one only brief one and there is nothing offensive language wise br br if more animated movies were this good i'd own more
<START> before viewing please make sure you have seen night of the living dead this might well be the best 7 minute parody i have ever seen absurd crappy <UNK> <UNK> the rope the rope and <UNK> <UNK> of bread what more do you need br br do not watch this movie while eating bread you might get scared
<START> this is another great movie i had the good fortune to see for the first time on the big screen thanks to rick baker et al back in the late 80's i was a relative newcomer to the genre and only really new about the big three <UNK> sh <UNK> i wasn't sure what to expect when i <UNK> my hard earned money to see this in a triple bill of classics at the old <UNK> i need not have worried i was left breathless by this movie if you're a fan of hong kong action kung fu movies and haven't seen this movie do so now
<START> caught part of george 2 on tv recently but couldn't get myself to watch it through to the end just awful i can't even remember the plot all i know is that george and ursula were not the george and ursula of the first movie which was bad enough there's a lot of <UNK> around but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy it was like watching <UNK> or deleted scenes having the original voice of ape the ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this george 2 is probably the single worst sequel i have ever seen and that is saying something <UNK> because of <UNK> 10 lines rule i have to keep <UNK> when i have nothing more to say about this <UNK> made for tv sequel disney hang your head in shame
<START> an mtv style film crew <UNK> of american t v programme producer <UNK> <UNK> matt <UNK> his <UNK> the australian <UNK> kate fisher and two <UNK> <UNK> named <UNK> hall <UNK> miller and jeremy joel west arrive on some nice looking island somewhere it's not actually revealed where the crew plan to shoot an expose on <UNK> which is apparently the latest <UNK> in extreme sports surfers throw bait into the sea and cut themselves to attract sharks just to see if they can out surf them without being eaten once there they are <UNK> by sonny <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his wife <UNK> susan africa their search for the perfect location leads them to the shark <UNK> waters of <UNK> <UNK> sonny <UNK> and their daughter <UNK> maureen <UNK> take them in their boat soon after arriving and having already shot some <UNK> footage sonny <UNK> and <UNK> are all killed by a 30 foot <UNK> crocodile that some say <UNK> the island the boat is sunk <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and jeremy appear stuck on the island until such time a rescue party arrives however after a run in with some <UNK> well i don't really know what they are pirates drug <UNK> <UNK> fat ugly people who just don't like being with other people who knows and more importantly who cares not me that's for sure anyway after escaping from these guys who look like pirates they are picked up just off the coast of the island by captain john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his girl arty <UNK> <UNK> as tara <UNK> the film crew believe they have been saved little do they know that the crocodile and captain <UNK> go way back and he has a score to settle and four members of a film crew aren't going to stop him captain <UNK> heads back to <UNK> <UNK> for a final showdown with the giant man eating crocodile br br directed by james d r <UNK> this is one awful film but it's still not as bad as tobe <UNK> crocodile 2000 everything about this film sucks the script by sam bernard and robert l levy is terrible extremely slow as the crocodile isn't even seen or mentioned before the 30 minute mark and by that time i was seriously bored and annoyed with the <UNK> unlikeable characters thought up by bernard and levy the whole film is also <UNK> predictable as well within the first 10 minutes anyone familiar with horror film stereotypes and stock characters will be able to guess who dies and who will survive the crocodile effects are awful and seem to be repeated over and over there is a small puppet head that obviously has <UNK> arm stuck inside it controlling it's movements as the water <UNK> become huge the cgi shots of the crocodile are just plain embarrassing to watch there is no gore apart from when a character is bitten in half which is achieved using cgi to <UNK> remove the actors legs again it looks terrible there is also a brief scene when someone is <UNK> on wooden <UNK> when they set a trap off there is a reasonable amount of nudity and sex plus the female actresses are nice and easy on the eye there are basic continuity and logical errors in the film too in one sequence <UNK> is filming <UNK> and jeremy <UNK> but from the angle and distance she is at it would be physically impossible to obtain footage of both the sharks and surfers at the same time and surely that is the whole point of her shot when <UNK> manages to <UNK> the crocodile the angle of the wire changes dramatically between shots in one shot the angle of the line looks like it's coming from the sky in the shot straight after the angle is completely different and it seems as if the line is coming from below the surface of the water when in actual fact the <UNK> is attached to the back of the boat and the line should be almost level with the surface i could carry on like why does the crocodile jump off the edge of a cliff if it's so smart as this film tries to make out but i would probably <UNK> the 1000 word limit if i listed everything that was wrong with this film so i won't i hated this film but rather <UNK> it's still not as bad as tobe <UNK> effort at a giant crocodile film definitely one to avoid
<START> if you want to remember <UNK> this is a good place to start this movie features sweet tunes <UNK> as robot and a crazy messed up plot i recall many a night passing out to this fine feature film in college and <UNK> the sheer <UNK> of whoever decided to green light this ridiculous piece of br br there is lots of singing lots of dancing there is lots of singing while dancing <UNK> <UNK> it as you would expect when it comes to this stuff but there is much more to this movie there is <UNK> there are fat children clay there is an <UNK> rabbit that michael jackson has to battle in a dance off obviously clay too there is joe <UNK> as well not made of clay br br rip we love you michael it is a sad day for all of us
<START> the choke aka axe in the uk is a slasher produced supposedly as a straight to dvd movie i say supposedly because the title of the movie does not have the v in <UNK> to indicate that it was a made for dvd movie even though it does have the appearance of one br br the plot is simple  a band is holding a gig in a former <UNK> factory and they are killed one by one br br i think most would agree that the movie was never going to be a masterpiece but this does not excuse the faults here even straight to dvd movies such as bachelor party massacre which has a very low imdb rating have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so called so bad they're good movies however the choke falls far short of being either a serious slasher such as halloween or being a so bad it's good movie such as the nail gun massacre br br the movie does start off good with a character killed using a <UNK> the blood effects were very cheesy but understandable given the very low budget but from there <UNK> it's downhill all the way br br there are so many faults in the choke that i could spend all day talking about them but a few obvious ones stand out and i'll go into them br br the aforementioned gig that the band holds seems to start off with around 50 people present but after the music stops there seems to be only around 8 people left and yet they're all meant to be locked in br br the characters in this movie are not likable at all most of the band members are aggressive foul mouthed morons or just downright weird no one really cares about what happens to them and even their supposed friends forget about them when they've been <UNK> the highlight of the movie is the presence of a homeless man who seems to regard the <UNK> factory as some kind of church seriously he <UNK> some really funny lines for no apparent reason but sadly even his presence can't save the movie br br there are too many scenes of people walking around and talking without any characterisation around <UNK> minutes of the film is spent watching characters walk around talking characters disappear for long periods of time without explanation as in other straight to dvd movies such as crocodile and grim weekend the characters spend a lot of time swearing at each other <UNK> without any <UNK> at all there are plenty of over the top <UNK> mainly from the male characters and one nearly results in a full blown fight in fact the format could be said to go as follows characters walk around murder takes place characters walk around murder takes place you get the idea br br the dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the f word being used perhaps this was meant to be funny but it just comes off as sad and more to the point we have all seen this done a thousand times before usually to much greater effect br br the movie is totally devoid of any suspense at all the dead bodies serve to provide the only indication that the characters are in danger a maniac is running around loose and yet the characters just behave like total morons they make little attempt to get out of the factory or find a weapon with which to protect themselves and much of the time they don't even pretend to be scared br br in the same vein as drive in massacre the killer is not seen at the time the murders are being committed with the exception of the final murder when the killer's identity is revealed a random weapon appears out of nowhere to kill the victim in question there is no one seen stalking the characters at any time in drive in massacre this served to make the film funny unintentionally of course but here it is not funny at all br br and as another reviewer has pointed out the soundtrack includes music that is very bad even for those who like punk rock the extras look uncomfortable dancing to it the score at the end there is no music at the beginning consists of a band of <UNK> <UNK> singing some very bad song that is completely unrelated to the movie br br don't <UNK> the points made in this review this reviewer likes bad movies such as the nail gun massacre and bachelor party massacre as much as the classics such as halloween and friday the 13th but it seems that the choke tried too hard to fit into one of those categories without fitting into either and even as straight to dvd movies go this is a poor effort br br on a positive note the film does contain some fairly good gory murder scenes but when the surviving characters do not take the situation seriously these scenes lose their importance quickly as the intensity they provide disappears into oblivion br br fans of the traditional 1980s b movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie and fans of the classics such as halloween and friday the 13th should do everything in their power to avoid it
<START> when i read the back of the dvd case i thought that it sounded really interesting so i had my mom throw it into the pile of movies in the 4 for 20 dollars section at blockbuster when we got home and popped in the movie twenty minutes into it we found ourselves turning to each other going this sucks let's put in something else i'll admit a few of the lines from the friends at the <UNK> made us smile a little bit but come on at least get some decent actors every once in a while in a movie if the acting is bad and the movie isn't going at a painfully slow pace and actually seems interesting i can gut it out and get a few laughs at how they're over or under doing their lines but i can only take so much crying scenes looked like the actors were having hysterical fits of laughter there was no delivery for their lines amateur doesn't even come close to the acting in this film br br anyone who came on here saying that this film was good had to have been on some really good drugs while they were watching the movie it's the most pointless thing i've ever had the <UNK> of watching do not watch or buy this movie
<START> this is one of the first independent movies i've ever seen for such a very low budget it was done well as an <UNK> myself i can sympathize with the main character although my sleeping problems have never been as intense or as disturbing br br well directed well acted of a subject that i haven't seen much in theaters lighting and set both perfect for the movie setting there are few noticeable goofs but they may be intended you'll see after you watch the movie the movie is very personal and worth watching twice no movie is flawless but a hollywood version couldn't do the story better all in all 8 10
<START> warning don't even consider watching this film in any form it's not even worth <UNK> from the internet every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid the so called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a film they couldn't tell a good joke to save their lives it's an insult to any human being if you're looking for a fun filled movie go look somewhere else br br let's hope this mr <UNK> the jr being a good indication for his obvious <UNK> and intellectual <UNK> dies a slow painful death and never makes a film again br br in fact it's even a waste of time to write anything about this crap that's why i'll stop right now and rather watch a good film
<START> got to this show late believe it was the 3rd and final episode when first watched it and was blown away by a social commentary that hasn't been seen on american tv since <UNK> in the <UNK> br br was very surprised cbs would even run this in the first place br br which is merely to say the last time cbs <UNK> a <UNK> if you know what i mean was back in the day of <UNK> in the <UNK> the most controversial decision they're willing to tackle today is how much eye make up to put on katie <UNK> br br if you want to make a bunch of folks really really mad let them discover the truth about themselves and if you want them willing to pull strings make calls and get a work of art removed let them discover that truth by hearing their own words spoken from their own mouths br br the <UNK> folks have always been way ahead of the <UNK> and this show is no different somehow it <UNK> under the cbs <UNK> social political <UNK> <UNK> to get it onto the schedule perhaps the <UNK> <UNK> never really watched it till it finally aired but once good <UNK> middle <UNK> heard and saw themselves being themselves well can bet the farm that message or the <UNK> won't last long br br now if only the <UNK> <UNK> can find their way onto <UNK> or bit <UNK> br br thank you <UNK> kelly <UNK> <UNK>
<START> very good western this was the first time writer richard wilson directed a film also this was a first for samuel <UNK> junior as a producer it is a pleasure to see a very young and pretty angie dickinson as a saloon girl robert mitchum comes to this town dominated by <UNK> and is hired as a town <UNK> but people are worried that he will go too far also about the harm that he will do to the <UNK> <UNK> there are some similarities in the story with <UNK> which was made in 1959 this film keeps a very fast and exciting pace it really keeps you on the edge
<START> i love buying those cheap lousy dvd's from <UNK> video one day i happened to buy this one it's the perfect silly science fiction film of the 50's all <UNK> up <UNK> with <UNK> everything scantily clad girls and plenty of melodrama it's an enjoyable film to those who appreciate this kind of stuff and if you can <UNK> your <UNK> enough you can actually get <UNK> out not just by the psychotic head or by the beating of the thing in the closet but toward the end with the character of 'the perfect <UNK> it's so what's another word for <UNK> ing
<START> it's movies like these that make you wish that you never picked on the nerd growing up in school if you liked this movie then i would suggest you watch valentine i just found out today that the guy who played marty simon killed himself a little after the movie was released which is a shame since he did a good job i wonder if it's because of the part he played in the movie it starts out when carol tricks him into going into the girls <UNK> to act like they were about to do it when he was changing in the <UNK> <UNK> popular friends <UNK> into the bathroom and got everything ready camera electric shock pole when marty open the curtain butt naked he realized that he was tricked he tries to cover the shower up but the kids open it grab marty and starts being mean to him while the camera is rolling they picked him up <UNK> his head in the <UNK> while it was being <UNK> and they <UNK> him slightly when the kids are in <UNK> given by the coach 2 of the boys give marty a joint that will make him throw up skip breaks one of the glass windows in the gym using a brick to get the teacher to excuse him while marty is <UNK> in the bathroom skip <UNK> into the science lab and mixes some stuff that looks like cocaine but not sure what it was the lab blows up <UNK> him badly 5 years later the kids who tormented him that day got <UNK> for a 5 year school reunion at the old school which was burn that day it <UNK> one by one the people get killed off i don't understand how the girl who drowned really drowned she could have gotten back up after marty left she almost got out the first time
<START> by 1945 and after a string of solid wwii propaganda pieces errol <UNK> hold over u s box office had started to decline so in spite of the <UNK> burden of <UNK> looks he <UNK> on a series of films <UNK> to that genre which had earlier made his name the <UNK> the first of these was a good one actually â adventures of don juan 1948 â but it also proved to be his last big budget hollywood starring vehicle the rest of his sword wielding days were spent wandering all over europe in england for kim 1950 the master of <UNK> 1953 and the dark <UNK> 1955 in france for adventures of captain <UNK> 1951 and italy for the <UNK> the story of william tell 1953 and the little seen crossed swords 1954 however hollywood did <UNK> him one last time to his old <UNK> ways â albeit for a <UNK> budgeted universal picture rather than a warner brothers <UNK> production to which he had been <UNK> when at his <UNK> br br still the glorious technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and while an older and <UNK> flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self his red headed leading lady maureen <UNK> has a field day as a <UNK> <UNK> leader who deep down <UNK> romance and wants to be treated like a lady anthony quinn was still a few years away from his larger than life starring vehicles so here he is typically seen as the baddie â the pirate captain <UNK> <UNK> a role he attacks with gusto like the black shield of <UNK> 1954 â a viewing of which <UNK> this one â against all <UNK> takes me back to my <UNK> childhood days of constant tv viewing when vintage hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and <UNK> italian channels br br for all i know this might well have been the very first pirate movie <UNK> ever seen and i cringe at the thought of <UNK> generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown pirates of the <UNK> trilogy is what <UNK> is all about as i said earlier against all <UNK> might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but <UNK> a solid example of this prolific genre all the same nowadays the <UNK> <UNK> of the child like indian princess alice <UNK> towards her pirate <UNK> flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it â despite clearly not <UNK> the heights of the sea <UNK> 1940 and the black <UNK> 1942 to mention the finest <UNK> <UNK> of its respective stars â is <UNK> paced and reasonably engaging incidentally the film would later go on to be remade as the <UNK> pirate 1967 with doug <UNK> br br for what <UNK> worth the <UNK> box office success of that <UNK> modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their <UNK> <UNK> titles and release them on dvd and as a matter of fact against all <UNK> itself was the one gem in a poorly thought out <UNK> of the golden age movie <UNK> set from universal which also consisted of obscure <UNK> like <UNK> girl 1950 with <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 1951 with donald <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with jeff chandler value for money perhaps but so far i have only acquired the errol flynn flick from other sources even so if the mood strikes me in future i might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like edward <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> mentioned <UNK> <UNK> and pirates of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i won't say this movie was bad but it wasn't good either i expected something good but i guess hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was much better than this this was completely old fashioned at every stage of this movie i hoped for some twist and what do i get the girl gets burned and wins her <UNK> love br br despite of being engaged they have to take <UNK> for every little move they make they are so darn shy even after so many <UNK> i expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that all she did was <UNK> <UNK> br br hey we have kids too but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always this movie is a dream happy family one cruel woman good in laws and a man who loves her to death in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was the poor <UNK> father and now it's vice versa and i somehow knew that <UNK> <UNK> would be in this movie anyway i believe i wasted my time i give it a 2 10
<START> as the godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive <UNK> this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the working man's point of view if you've never watched this show you're in for an extended treat yes there is violence and nudity but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast tony soprano the thinking man's gangster with the reality of the life he has been born to and quite frankly would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up tony soprano can discuss sun <UNK> with his <UNK> then beat a man to death with a <UNK> pan in a fit of rage and while <UNK> and <UNK> of the body with his nephew take a break sit down and watch tv while eating <UNK> <UNK> out of the jar and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a sunday afternoon of viewing <UNK> football even <UNK> his wife when given a chance for a way out finds that she really prefers life with tony and the <UNK> that go with it and looking the other way at his <UNK> versus life on her own if you followed the whole thing you know how it ends if you didn't trust me you've never seen a tv show end like this
<START> may contain spoilers br br all dogs go to heaven is a great movie i saw it in 1989 when i was two years old i didn't understand it that well but as i saw it more and more times i started to love it i love the songs in this movie my favorite songs are let me be surprised and soon you'll come home those are beautiful songs the only thing that bothers me about the movie is charlie <UNK> when i was little my sister couldn't even watch that part other than that this movie is wonderful br br my favorite part of the movie is when <UNK> and charlie are flying around heaven heaven is beautiful in the movie and the <UNK> are very clever i also love itchy in fact i have 3 <UNK> of my own they are so cute br br overall i love this movie and suggest everyone should see it i give this movie 10 10 stars
<START> i guess that <UNK> wasn't quite as god awful as most of the movies that mystery science theater 3000 shows but westerns just aren't roger <UNK> <UNK> portraying rose hood beverly garland becoming sheriff in an old west town after her sheriff husband gets murdered and having to fight off baddies the movie is pretty predictable john ireland is <UNK> new <UNK> secretly working for <UNK> allison hayes yes the 50 foot woman also appearing briefly is frequent corman co star dick miller as a <UNK> miller nowadays stars in joe <UNK> movies br br i do wish to <UNK> that you'll probably want to watch the mst3k version to really enjoy this movie they had a great time with it
<START> every one should see this movie because each one of us is broken in some way and it may help us realize 1 my life isn't as bad as i thought it was and 2 how important it is to adopt a child in need there are so many out there to think that the movie was actually based on a real person made us think deep about life and how the world has and always will be corrupt but that corruption doesn't have to reach your home we all have a choice definitely recommend this one and while you're at it i'd like to throw in the color purple and woman <UNK> art <UNK> by t d <UNK> br br these are all movies that are based on life and give us a glimpse of life
<START> i would firstly say that somehow i remember seeing this movie in my early childhood i couldn't read the subtitles and i thought sonny chiba was sean connery but i did really like the concept if you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult <UNK> and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie that said having just watched the restored <UNK> minute version on dvd i have to say i enjoyed it though not as much as when i was seven i remembered the ending br br there are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments my favourite being the contrast between scenes acted out in the final 10 minutes and the curious choice of backing music listen to the lyrics br br for an action film there is a great deal of focus on the personal stories of certain soldiers and the social dynamics of the squad as the strain of their time travel takes its <UNK> by the ending of the movie i had decided that this was a good thing when seven i though the <UNK> <UNK> was a bad thing br br for an action film there is also plenty of <UNK> gory action especially a couple of epic battle scenes between the platoon and <UNK> of <UNK> era warriors the makers of the movie have <UNK> that as many deaths as possible are bloody and lets face it humorous i thought this was a splendid aspect of the movie when i was a kid and i am not ashamed to say that i still do br br i also like the fact that the modern day soldiers in general don't spend the movie walking on egg <UNK> trying to avoid <UNK> the space time <UNK> they've got heavy <UNK> machine guns <UNK> rocket <UNK> a tank and a helicopter and they're hell bent on making <UNK> japan theirs which is what i'd like to think any <UNK> imdb user would do in their boots br br in short the movies worth watching it makes the viewer regret that there are not more movies made with a similar premise and at the same time offers some <UNK> hints as to why a movie like g i samurai is so unique
<START> while <UNK> was by no means a young man when he was <UNK> to work on this project he was still a <UNK> director with only a single pictures a successful adaptation of a short wwii story to his name <UNK> of course had already been an established acting star for a decade but <UNK> skills mean little behind the camera and as a director he was woefully <UNK> to <UNK> a production of such scale and it shows through muddled shot compositions especially apparent in group scenes often unfortunate camera positions performances of wildly varying quality for the director was apparently so overwhelmed by the sheer <UNK> of the task actors were apparently left to their own devices awkward <UNK> that sound like radio broadcast <UNK> br br <UNK> war and peace was probably the main reason that <UNK> the soviet government to spare no expense on this production the <UNK> release of the <UNK> picture made quite a <UNK> certainly <UNK> wanted to <UNK> the greatest strength of the hollywood film and find his own audrey his final choice <UNK> <UNK> a big eyed <UNK> dark haired thing indeed somewhat resembles hepburn unfortunately she was a <UNK> ballet dancer without neither acting experience nor talent so <UNK> the most kind word that i can find to describe her performance is awful br br though it might be expected that soviet actors speaking the same language as <UNK> characters would have better understanding of them than <UNK> but this war and peace often proves that not to be the case the revolutionary <UNK> swept away the thin upper <UNK> of russian cultural <UNK> that the world of war and peace grown out of so a good share of these big name soviet actors involved in this production often look as clueless as americans performing shakespeare i don't mean of course that american actors can't possibly play shakespeare <UNK> but you'll know what i mean if you witnessed american members of the cast in branagh's adaptations of the three main characters only <UNK> pierre is commendable but even he was too old for the part and feels out of place in the early going
<START> if you want to <UNK> a good jason scott lee film i recommend the following br br dragon the bruce lee story br br <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> 2 the berlin decision is an awful film awful production values awful acting awful script i would not recommend this film to be watched by anyone who seriously believes that tripe like this is quality entertainment or advances asian american awareness in hollywood this film does neither br br i would at the very least say that this film is passable entertainment on a rainy day if you ever come across it while channel surfing if you are curious perhaps a rental from netflix but this film is definitely not for keeps br br if you are one of the few people who watched this film as a means to raise your asian american film awareness and came away disappointed then i recommend the following films for your personal viewing these are well written films with high production values that feature a talented cast of asian american actors br br better luck tomorrow br br <UNK>
<START> they made me watch this in school and it was terrible the movie is outdated the episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting the teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience i have read that very few people who appear in this are actors but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life this accounts for cheesy acting very often also very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far fetched i don't like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them though it was written to be educational funny suspenseful and hip it ended up being boring dry far fetched and old i hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it
<START> from the what was she thinking file whoopi goldberg plays a cop in the future who is teamed with a talking dinosaur for a crime case involving a madman who wants to start another ice age straight to tape <UNK> is embarrassing and ridiculous a high concept in search of itself apparently this was a labor of love for its writer director jonathan <UNK> who also served as one of the producers sadly the end results are <UNK> to be <UNK> <UNK> mere presence on screen can often spark good will and laughter no matter how poor the script but here she's drowning and you can see the unfunny results no stars from
<START> mary <UNK> is definitely much better but this is a lovely film nonetheless angela lansbury is <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> price and david <UNK> has great fun as mr brown their chemistry was just brilliant as well the children however just lacked the same <UNK> though paul is very funny and cute the songs were actually not as bad as some people say beautiful <UNK> sea is the best in fact all the songs are outstanding the special effects were wonderful that had plenty of magic and the story is original enough the highlights though like mary <UNK> were the animated sequences the underwater sequence was beautiful but my favourite was the football match which was absolutely hilarious the only other criticism was that i didn't quite get the ending when i first saw it all in all a lovely film that is hardly ever on 8 10 <UNK> cox
<START> the man from snowy river ii doesn't <UNK> the wheel but is a crowd pleasing beautiful film that hits some great notes br br for those fans wanting the elements that made the original man from snowy river film a hit breathtaking scenery sweeping score sweet <UNK> and cracking action this film really delivers this story picks up a few years from the end of the first jim tom <UNK> has been away gathering his fortune in a <UNK> of stock horses he returns to pick up where he left off with his <UNK> well <UNK> sweetheart jessica played by aussie divine lady <UNK> <UNK> who is still attempting to break out of her <UNK> upbringing on her <UNK> cattle station harrison is now played by american brian <UNK> the foil to jim and character that shakes the plot is the well to do upper class <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nicholas <UNK> who has his sights on jessica add to the mix some social tension surrounding <UNK> and the <UNK> with a bad attitude from the first film and that's the plot br br the best thing about this film is the acting tom <UNK> fits <UNK> into <UNK> wide <UNK> hat and <UNK> humour <UNK> <UNK> is a lovely heroine and the two manage some real chemistry on screen filling the solid shoes of kirk douglas was never going to be easy and brian <UNK> <UNK> and shouts but never feels very authentic in this part br br the music is sweeping and lush and the cinematography could be a roll from a victoria <UNK> reel there are moment however that feel very self indulgent like the director wants just one more helicopter shot of the riders to show how gorgeous the landscape is without some personal human drama a little more <UNK> would have <UNK> here we are <UNK> we can take it there are some very <UNK> moments with the <UNK> that defy belief however the funny thing about this film is that in amongst some glaring clichés there are some really inventive and touching scenes jim putting the <UNK> on the <UNK> very horse <UNK> before its time jim and jessica setting up home the fabulous scene where jim shows up <UNK> riding with his <UNK> whip i can see why this character is such an icon br br altogether a very pleasing sequel here's hoping everyone involved wants to make another the man from snowy river iii the <UNK> i'm sure we'd all love to see how jim and jessica are doing on their farm br br the aussie dvd has a couple of extra scenes in it worthwhile if you are already a fan
<START> the order starts in rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts demons named brother dominic <UNK> <UNK> is found dead cut to new york city where one of his order alex <UNK> heath ledger is <UNK> by top <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> peter <UNK> who <UNK> him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding <UNK> death along with his girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fellow priest thomas <UNK> mark <UNK> alex travels to italy to delve into his <UNK> death as the truth begins to emerge it appears that dominic was a <UNK> <UNK> someone who absorbed other's sins lived with the burden of them so they could die <UNK> that the church wasn't happy about his activities alex must do what's right even if it goes against what he believes br br also know under the title the sin eater this american german co production was written produced directed by <UNK> <UNK> didn't really do that much for me if i'm honest i usually am honest that is anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some ok ideas but it's <UNK> predictable excruciatingly dull boring really silly at times it takes itself far too seriously the whole concept is <UNK> while it thinks it's clever with it's oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up brings the story full circle i thought it was the most obvious lazy way to end things there's the usual religious themes here morality sin forgiveness faith belief <UNK> blah blah blah you know the sort of thing then there's the twists which aren't hard to see coming there's the abuse of power by high <UNK> <UNK> corruption greed evil etc you know the sort of clichéd hollywood ideals themes that get <UNK> every time it deals with the church the order has nothing new to say as a serious piece of film making it sucks a lot i'm not too sure who the order is meant to appeal to as a die hard horror fan i didn't see much horror in this at all as a thriller it's less than thrilling as a mystery it's too predictable there's nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest for some reason i cannot figure out the imdb also lists the order as an action film which is absurd as it's as exciting action packed as the average episode of <UNK> street 1969 present harsh maybe but it's what i think br br director <UNK> does an ok job the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme it all looks a bit drab <UNK> dull for a supposed horror film the order is very light on scares or horror elements in fact there aren't any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason don't ask forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any which is fine but it would have helped at least make the order somewhat watchable according the <UNK> <UNK> section the release date of the order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny all i can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they aren't exactly brilliant as it stands now br br i was amazed to see the order had a budget of about 28 000 000 which is a hell of a lot of money i just can't see where it all went apart from the sets production design which are good the whole film looks feels very average utterly forgettable the acting is ok although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul mouthed comic relief <UNK> a good actor such as peter <UNK> deserves better than this br br the order i prefer the title the sin eater actually not that it matters too much misses all of it's intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as i'm concerned is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so don't do it not recommended
<START> while being an <UNK> youth when first experiencing the gundam wing series upon re watching the series i have <UNK> my belief that this series is not only beautifully animated but the plot the gundam design character design and character depth are masterfully executed while at first appearing like a boy band of sorts the stylish <UNK> of the characters can partly be credited to just great art with individual personalities creating clear and endearing <UNK> among the characters consequently it is extremely easy to become to drawn to any particular character personally i liked <UNK> because of his stoic personality while i may be biased with a sentimental <UNK> of this show to my childhood i can <UNK> say that gundam wing <UNK> the deeper questions of war and life in general how can we obtain peace while providing action packed battles in large robot suits which to say the least is excellent
<START> i was so excited when i discovered this was available i couldn't wait to see it what a waste of energy it's kind of like that <UNK> cd by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery but once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it onto a real album this dvd is only recommended for <UNK> who must have everything lynch has done six men getting sick is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive it lacks the power of lynch's later work the grandmother is quite simply an immature work it's tedious and looks like a student film but it was the 70's it's interesting only if you hope to <UNK> the director but you can see briefly the <UNK> of some of his trademark images and sounds the <UNK> is forgettable no really i can't remember this one at all the <UNK> is pointless the cowboy and the frenchman is just plain silly <UNK> is the only worthwhile one in the bunch without dialog lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work i had to watch this one several times but it runs less than 2 minutes hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying the dvd
<START> once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they somehow managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended you'll find that it's not half bad the plot is engaging and interesting and the pacing is fast with this covering many situations and thus often jumping <UNK> on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken where this really stands out is the acting the performances are excellent <UNK> and streep are both impeccable it's also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film and even those who don't come naturally to it at least attempt an accent the cinematography and editing are nice enough but they don't really go beyond the standard stuff this movie's story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture i understand that it is quite close to the truth there is some <UNK> to strong language and disturbing content in this it is at times a downright great courtroom drama i recommend this to any fellow fan of such 7 10
<START> roman polanski plays <UNK> who <UNK> an apartment in france the previous tenant is in a hospital after a suicide attempt he goes to see her there where he also meets stella isabelle <UNK> the friend of <UNK> he and stella become pretty close later <UNK> dies <UNK> begins to think the <UNK> and the neighbors are trying to change him into <UNK> so that eventually he would also jump out of the window le <UNK> the tenant from 1976 is the last film of <UNK> apartment trilogy the previous ones were <UNK> and rosemary's baby roman polanski does not do good job only as the director but his acting is also superb isabelle <UNK> with her big glasses is wonderful the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is played by the great melvyn douglas jo van fleet plays <UNK> <UNK> the fantastic shelley winters is the <UNK> the tenant is something very scary from time to time it gives a lot of that psychological scare this film is not the <UNK> one to understand or explain but that makes it all so fascinating
<START> the world is a terrible place but this movie is farce and it's fun and if you don't like it you don't get it and if you don't get it doesn't matter it's up to you if you want to play along every actor in this one had fun it's only a joke and that's good enough for me gabriel <UNK> is priceless <UNK> and paul <UNK> doing my way is as <UNK> puts it the best version ever okay it's no masterpiece but it's not bad i was warned against seeing it but i'm sure glad i did
<START> it seems to me that stephen king's <UNK> pen name was a way for him to put out some of the <UNK> <UNK> more mean spirited stuff that he wanted to write without <UNK> his <UNK> <UNK> if you look back at the <UNK> books running man the long walk <UNK> thinner you notice they have a sealed in feeling of <UNK> and <UNK> about them that is distinct from mainstream king i realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a <UNK> blood covered emotionally crippled teenage girl <UNK> everyone at her high school prom but mainstream king always at have characters and plot elements that <UNK> the <UNK> of the proceedings a bit and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling <UNK> books are just plain mean and always end badly btw pet <UNK> could have easily been a <UNK> book if king hadn't revealed the <UNK> by then and the dark half seems to be at least partially about his <UNK> persona br br thinner was the last <UNK> book and man with its themes of class <UNK> revenge and death by <UNK> it is nasty so it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit br br what is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a tv movie of the week level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release these days something like this would probably go directly to dvd or cable the makeup work and the striking <UNK> starving to death in the midst of plenty a metaphor for the <UNK> <UNK> american middle class if there ever was one is all that keeps you watching this misfire br br what went wrong my first thought is that the director was going for the nasty <UNK> vibe but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices the actors here with the exception of joe <UNK> simply can't carry the movie and then he <UNK> the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure plus he couldn't leave the plot alone and his changes don't really help the script and dialog ought to work but mostly the movie just lies there everything is <UNK> dull <UNK> and no fun to watch with the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character getting thinner and thinner and thinner br br as other have pointed out thinner is by no means the worst king movie ever made or even the second worst and it does have a dreadful compelling fascination <UNK> to the theme and the careful makeup work but first time viewers should approach this one with <UNK> expectations
<START> can i do it <UNK> i need glasses at the very least proves the point that anyone can make a movie talent is not a consideration the folks who unleashed this wretched pile of <UNK> vomit upon the world lack any semblance of talent taste or intelligence the target audience must consist of the recently <UNK> and <UNK> who play with their own <UNK> anyone else would be far too world wise to get even a <UNK> out of this film it consists of a series of <UNK> skits in which the punchline does not even <UNK> to the obvious it ends at the ludicrous the jokes told are the types of jokes that <UNK> school children tell usually <UNK> or sexually related where they don't know the meaning of all of the terms they use you know like the one about <UNK> car and <UNK> garage to apply any <UNK> method of criticism would be pointless since the usual standards of acting writing direction and such have never even been heard of by the creative minds behind this mess not to be <UNK> but anyone who enjoyed this film should seriously reflect upon their purpose on this earth br br
<START> if this is supposed to be the black experience let me out at either the front or back door br br a <UNK> boy one day sees 2 young <UNK> walk by and from then on it's all down hill for him angela <UNK> the one shining grace in this film plays his over protective religious mother despite her anger at how his life has turned by the middle of the picture she really decides to accept this she allows his friends to come in and suddenly it's all right to use the profanity as long as it's not in front of the children br br this is a sad state of affairs regarding gangster rap you knew where this film was heading br br i literally laughed out loud when at the end when <UNK> is accompanying her son's body for burial she states that while his life had been cut short at age 24 he had become a man what man he had been a convicted criminal wrote the most atrocious rap music with constant <UNK> and <UNK> society that scene in the <UNK> where he tells a teacher that as a <UNK> worker he will earn more than the teacher is a perfect example of what goes on in our schools the complete and utter lack of respect for the teacher br br the east coast west coast gang rap rivalry is never fully explained all we see are guns blazing br br a terrible picture doing nothing to prevent gang violence what horrible role models are these rap singers and their foul music the african american community should take <UNK> at their very being who was this <UNK> fat <UNK> who portrayed <UNK> he made <UNK> from the old television show look thin by comparison i know it was the streets of <UNK> <UNK> that changed this <UNK> little boy into the vulgar monster that he was what a sorry state of affairs when this is called motion picture entertainment
<START> just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home she then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why br br this is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesn't quite i can't really put my finger on why it didn't work but it was good enough that i kind of wished it was better or at least had gotten the little things right like having the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks be closer in size i think perhaps thats whats wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong
<START> just like al gore <UNK> us up with his painfully honest and cleverly presented documentary movie an <UNK> truth directors <UNK> <UNK> and mark <UNK> also remind us that it's about time to improve our way of life in order to save our beautiful planet planet earth is also a wake up call that the global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living creatures around the world al gore showed us the bleak future of planet earth by presenting hard facts backed up by documented examples through long yet always interesting monologues the creators of this documentary choose a different yet equally powerful way to accomplish this they do not present us with a future representation of what might occur to our planet if we don't <UNK> change things around but they rather show us the genuine beauty of planet earth in all of its amazing glory we see places that we knew that existed but never thought they could be so beautiful in this movie we see a wide array of the most extraordinary places such as <UNK> <UNK> giant <UNK> full of <UNK> and <UNK> and icy landscapes as far as the eye could see and in all of those immensely different <UNK> we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive br br this is exactly the kind of movie that had to be made in combination with the one from al gore in order to make us realize that our planet is too precious to <UNK> with the voice over by patrick stewart is always relaxing and thus very well done although at first it sounded as though i was watching an x men movie instead the cinematography is probably the most remarkable thing of this documentary at times what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a man with a camera actually had to film all of that delightful footage br br in short this is definitely a must see for everyone since it concerns every single person on this beautiful planet earth the truth is i never thought our planet was so astonishingly beautiful
<START> his choice of films the basic <UNK> of the production which places him in the sets or <UNK> of the films he is commenting on and his delivery are brilliant but if you want <UNK> be aware that you're getting <UNK> version of <UNK> which should not be confused with <UNK> himself as usual zizek delivers complex ideas with gusto and in a convincing manner the rub is he is also quite <UNK> and so there may be more in his gusto than in actual content <UNK> it is a gem psychologically this will have people of all <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> scratching their heads but reaching for the popcorn all the same zizek is a phenomenon and pop icon <UNK> himself
<START> i'm not sure it was the language or the poor acting but everything about this movie feels and looks cheap and fake br br after seeing der <UNK> this is a huge disappointment there's no connection between different scenes and the acting is so incredibly poor i couldn't even believe people could make such a mess of something that had great potential br br and above all everyone in germany speaks english big mistake the german language has a certain sound to it and especially hitler himself only sounds like hitler when he's speaking yelling german br br the way the story is told made me believe it was improvised on the spot the characters were empty and the movie seems to be a collection of random events that could have happened br br whether it's the english or the fact that i've already seen der <UNK> everything about this movie was fake and ridiculous
<START> scoop out of woody allen is definitely not my favorite director but i enjoyed match point it was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star woody allen it did have the beautiful scarlett johansson in it br br scoop is woody allen's latest film and though he appears in this one it's ok it also features scarlett johansson and the two of them work perfect together br br johansson plays sondra <UNK> a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of joe <UNK> ian <UNK> joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim <UNK> and a bunch of other souls the <UNK> has taken one of those souls is the secretary of peter <UNK> hugh jackman she tells joe that peter may be the serial killer <UNK> the streets of england joe with the scoop of a life time travels back to the living and gives this info to sondra during a magic act sondra is at some magic show with magician sid <UNK> woody allen she becomes a <UNK> to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box she gets the visit from joe not knowing what to do she <UNK> the help of sid <UNK> to help her crack the case br br this film has a nice light hearted feel to it compared to match point and yet it all works johansson and allen work great together allen's humor fits perfect for this story and role hugh jackman is terrific as peter <UNK> the suspected serial killer br br this is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch the cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching woody allen be himself i say give it a chance because you just might like it
<START> it is a great tragedy that both richard harris and john derek are no longer with us but that shouldn't blind anybody to the fact that in 1981 a pretty ugly <UNK> appears on both men's <UNK> no doubt john derek conceived this movie doing for his wife what <UNK> like it <UNK> and <UNK> million years <UNK> did for <UNK> monroe and <UNK> <UNK> respectively creating an iconic sex symbol for the new decade having run to embrace dudley moore on the beach in <UNK> <UNK> reputation an all star cast and location filming in <UNK> <UNK> meant that nothing could go wrong alas as they say <UNK> plan and god laughs it is said that when this film premiered in 1981 the edgar rice <UNK> estate tried to take legal action against it bo derek plays jane parker who sets off into turn of the century africa to be reunited with her <UNK> abusive dad richard harris daddy parker is an <UNK> who has set out to find 'the great <UNK> <UNK> the stuff of local legend whose existence has been poo <UNK> by conventional wisdom harris is worth watching for a wonderfully hammy <UNK> up performance which includes singing an irish <UNK> at an indian elephant that somehow found its way into africa did it arrive at the same time as the <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> furthermore although jane <UNK> to despise parker bo and <UNK> relationship is <UNK> incestuous <UNK> perhaps to the effects of the <UNK> heat before long however local legends start to <UNK> about a <UNK> white <UNK> and jane hears the famous <UNK> this is the movie's cue for miles <UNK> a future b movie star making a rather odd debut as the <UNK> <UNK> lord of the jungle unlike johnny <UNK> with his <UNK> english or ron <UNK> who speaks the language <UNK> the <UNK> tarzan is mute given some of bo and <UNK> dialog though this is probably not a bad thing harris and his <UNK> eventually reaches the great <UNK> sea located <UNK> a gigantic <UNK> that seems to run halfway across africa hang on aren't <UNK> <UNK> and other <UNK> places generally located in low lying areas <UNK> it is just one of many <UNK> in the john derek universe the crew attempt to <UNK> the <UNK> and when the <UNK> snap harris <UNK> <UNK> abuse at the hapless men who have <UNK> to their deaths on another occasion jane decides to take a nude swim by the <UNK> sea giving another occasion to see some gratuitous nudity out of nowhere a single male lion appears now lions usually travel in <UNK> and never go near <UNK> but later on tarzan will be wrestling with a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doesn't seem to have been one of john <UNK> strong points this being a tarzan movie jane becomes enchanted with the lord of the jungle and <UNK> to take his virginity but having seen his <UNK> to some of those <UNK> you do have to wonder speaking of which it's not only the edgar rice <UNK> estate could have <UNK> it is highly <UNK> that certain <UNK> were on the phone to their lawyers the <UNK> here make you miss <UNK> badly especially when they do ridiculous things like ride on the backs of elephants and <UNK> their hands when tarzan and jane finally get it on the climax of this film has bo and harris captured by some rather stereotypical cannibals who paint our heroine and prepare to sacrifice eat <UNK> her suffice is to say that the great wooden ape gets his girl and spoiler harris gets himself <UNK> on a huge elephant <UNK> this doesn't stop the dying parker from delivering a rambling monologue to jane as far as i am aware the law suit from the rice <UNK> estate never <UNK> but <UNK> the ape man' was <UNK> at the box office no kidding a pity john derek could have directed <UNK> the ape man <UNK> with bo derek and miles <UNK> living in domestic bliss and dudley moore as <UNK> '
<START> i'm afraid that you'll find that the huge majority of people who rate this movie as a 10 are highly christian i am not if you are looking for a christian movie i recommend this film if you are looking for a good general movie i'm afraid you'll need to go elsewhere br br i was annoyed by the characters and their illogical behaviour the premise of the movie is that the teaching of morality without teaching that it was jesus who is the basis of morality is itself wrong one scene shows the main character telling a boy that it is wrong to steal and then the character goes on to say that it was jesus who taught us this i find that offensive are we to believe that <UNK> <UNK> not steal came from jesus i suppose he wrote the ten <UNK> and stealing was acceptable before that i rented the movie from netflix i should have realized the nature of the movie from the comments oh well
<START> i recently rented this doc having remembered hearing about it from imdb com and being intrigued by the premise i knew very little about either of these bands but i do remember hearing not if you were the last <UNK> on earth by the dandy warhols ages ago and enjoying it that being said this is my perspective on the doc br br one thing i found incredible about this film is there is no need to have any prior knowledge of either of these bands the director <UNK> <UNK> wastes no time in engaging the audience and <UNK> them with the people in this film i quickly became <UNK> to the lives both anton and <UNK> as well as their respective bands the brian <UNK> massacre and the dandy warhols i think that is part of what makes this doc so good and what makes <UNK> <UNK> such a master <UNK> br br i also loved how the story of these bands was told most of what you see is of the bands on tour both bands start out playing small <UNK> and struggling to make it in the recording industry throughout the film each band <UNK> to remain unique and <UNK> by the norm however it is this that makes the two bands similar and thus the brilliant perspective on how two bands of a <UNK> can go in such different directions br br i would basically recommend this for anyone who likes film in general you do not need to have a particular love for documentaries or either of the bands an appreciation for music helps but the music itself takes a <UNK> to the love hate relationship between the brian <UNK> massacre and the dandy warhols
<START> saw this again recently on comedy central i'd love to see jean <UNK> <UNK> and emmy collins hippie in supermarket cast as mother and son in a film it would probably be the <UNK> <UNK> ever made hats off to waters for making a consistently funny film
<START> this is shallow <UNK> and or social commentary wrapped in a tragic tale about a jealous young woman's scheme to drive apart her father and his fiancée is it incest or just a view through the eyes of a daughter with an <UNK> complex who cares all of the characters except for anne deborah kerr are vacuous and vile <UNK> is poor i agree with the boys with breasts comment of an earlier review the plot <UNK> this predictable material was sufficient for about 30 minutes of film that unfortunately was stretched over an hour and a half if you want to see great <UNK> and <UNK> on the <UNK> i recommend to catch a thief in which you will get the added <UNK> of an entertaining story and likable characters br br i like for films to entertain me i personally don't really care where a film is set whatever the time or place i want a good story comedy or drama i also want to see some enjoyable characters it doesn't hurt if i can relate to them poor deborah kerr gives a typically good performance and so does david niven in a despicable role br br the 2 rating is solely for kerr and niven and for the cinematography the rich color scenes and the murky foreboding black and white scenes unfortunately all the great cinematography in the world cannot salvage a poor story with un enjoyable characters a <UNK> ear is still a <UNK> ear consequently watching this mess was a serious waste of my time
<START> good performances can't save this terrible script <UNK> with every cliche in the chick flick book both main characters are deeply unsympathetic and the scene where laura <UNK> character <UNK> about sex with her dead husband in front of her teenage son which i think is supposed to be poignant is just horrifying
<START> this is still the <UNK> to judge all golden age <UNK> by and taking into account the limited technology and dubious <UNK> standards of the authorities on screen bears up well against all generations of similar attempts since on film and tv fast and furious with plenty of warner bros <UNK> and thankfully no time for a love interest it <UNK> along taking the splendid cast with it to the violent end i never understood why the da had to trail vance around everywhere i always thought they were <UNK> palette as the detective but especially <UNK> as the doctor are delightfully eccentric and un pc when <UNK> over the second murder victim he <UNK> that there were too many people in the world anyway of course it is william powell as philo vance and michael <UNK> as director that makes the film what it is when did powell ever make a dud br br the army of cops at the crime scene didn't really do a very good job in finding the second dead body and unconscious dog did they the best bit is where vance <UNK> to us all the sequence of events surrounding the murders dodgy model sets combine with fantastic <UNK> camera angles to produce a very modern feel and startling with what has gone before the only problem is as usual the conclusion can't match the overall <UNK> <UNK> displayed throughout and a somewhat contrived ending is <UNK> some chan's <UNK> and many others of course could only be <UNK> this way too but because it happens so fast and is slightly dubious morally it doesn't <UNK> my opinion of <UNK> status as a classic br br all the <UNK> i've ever seen of <UNK> are at worst like looking into a <UNK> bowl so if you're interested in seeing it bear with it until you're sucked in
<START> the finale of the <UNK> tarzan movies is a rather weak one there are a few things that <UNK> this film br br first tarzan spends much of the film wearing <UNK> <UNK> in my opinion any <UNK> on tarzan whether it be <UNK> or boots as sometimes portrayed takes away from the character which is supposed to be anti civilization and pro jungle br br second the character of <UNK> as mentioned in a previous post totally <UNK> the movie as the comic foil to me his character is unnecessary to the film's plot br br also while <UNK> still cuts a commanding figure as tarzan it's apparent that he was not in his best shape although in his later jungle jim movies his <UNK> had improved somewhat from this film br br the <UNK> battle is a terrific idea but i think it should have been done in an earlier <UNK> film when he was at his physical peak likewise the battle which takes only 30 seconds tops would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in tarzan and his mate br br and while brenda <UNK> as jane and linda christian as <UNK> are <UNK> pleasing to the eye it doesn't manage to salvage this last <UNK> film a disappointing ending to a great character run
<START> i was pleased to see that she had black hair i've been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories br br i was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer it didn't spoil it at all in fact i watched the film twice in one day a sure sign that it was up to standard this is what i do with books that i like as well br br i thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of modesty blaise extremely well as <UNK> in both book and comic strip i would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly has he actually read the books br br i thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation
<START> imagine pulling back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding barbara <UNK> there that's what happens with this film br br the opening showed promise but soon it drops all <UNK> of being a thriller or even an imaginative love story and the only reason they made this story becomes <UNK> clear to fill a gap in their female viewing market by creating yet another re <UNK> of <UNK> understood brooding bad <UNK> <UNK> meets <UNK> whimsical <UNK> paula br br rather than waste any time in creating an original premise the filmmakers went straight for the money shot the bad boy being <UNK> by said whimsical beauty <UNK> follows a string of <UNK> and heavily clichéd love scenes <UNK> with pseudo philosophical poetic fluff <UNK> admission of being <UNK> a <UNK> is <UNK> in to round out the perceived qualities a <UNK> hero should have but even when we're told in heavy <UNK> writing who and what he is it's still difficult to believe it or care br br for a <UNK> hero <UNK> to work the story needs subtlety style and <UNK> all of which are utterly absent here this is not a modern day phantom of the opera it's just what happens when a weak and rather silly woman with loose <UNK> <UNK> dates a bad man who after meeting her seems as dangerous as bunny <UNK> br br the performances might have saved this film had they been any good the female lead is <UNK> with looking sexy and <UNK> no matter how forced or ridiculous and poor <UNK> scott appears to have been drugged as he <UNK> through his part this is not his best work the <UNK> of interest were brought by <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> and andrew lee <UNK> as the young photographer brother a better movie would have <UNK> the sister and kept the brother instead
<START> panic in the streets opens in high noir style a view along a dark street followed by a camera <UNK> <UNK> to a window behind which is playing out a sleazy card game an opening <UNK> which along with some of the location shooting <UNK> some of the atmosphere welles brought a decade later in touch of evil one of the players throws open the window it's an appropriate action serving as an introduction to the events within as well as literally opening up our first view of the underworld br br shot in high contrast black and white panic in the streets benefits immensely from a strong cast as well as some fine location shooting in new orleans scenes set in such places as the <UNK> the crowded <UNK> office or amidst the <UNK> paint of <UNK> <UNK> offer a unique and sometimes claustrophobic atmosphere impossible to recreate in the studio with these elements <UNK> film shows the influence of <UNK> groundbreaking naked city of two years earlier which established the gritty almost documentary style within the noir cycle in fact <UNK> previous role had been in <UNK> even <UNK> night and the city a film in which a sense of rising panic was even more prevalent joe macdonald a favourite with the director photographed panic in the <UNK> detailed environment macdonald also worked on <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and went on to shoot widmark again three years later in <UNK> masterpiece pick up on south street br br as others have noticed in a manner typical of some noir films <UNK> work offers a contrast between the confusion sickness and <UNK> of the streets with the modest calm home life of the <UNK> but whereas for instance in <UNK> the big heat 1953 the home life of the hero is destroyed by elements of vice surrounding the <UNK> central character ultimately sending him back to work with an <UNK> <UNK> and sense of vengeance panic in the streets places <UNK> rising <UNK> within the confines of what amounts to just another working <UNK> despite all the danger ultimately he returns back to the <UNK> of his family justified and satisfied the <UNK> being that social balance has been restored at least for the moment by his <UNK> and <UNK> skills br br that <UNK> of course has been created by crime and disease the two are closely associated in this film it reminds one of the <UNK> from the much <UNK> <UNK> 1986 where crime is the disease meet the cure a neat <UNK> in context if one which rings too <UNK> of social <UNK> at its climax as <UNK> attempts to flee aboard ship the visuals specifically <UNK> to rats as being similar to criminals both posing a menace to <UNK> health as the presumably infected <UNK> <UNK> round the cheap rooms and the <UNK> with his <UNK> in search of something he suspects everyone is after if without knowing exactly what it is <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> together in the audiences mind adding further to connected <UNK> ironically <UNK> <UNK> about <UNK> unfortunate cousin that he brought something in of note is correct even if finally its nothing he can sell or steal <UNK> logical <UNK> that the police would not normally bother with the murder of some anonymous illegal immigrant has a ring of truth about it and his so confusion is understandable br br dr reed although home loving and on the side of society is a true noir hero familiar to the genre is the chief protagonist as a man who walks alone forced to travel beyond the limits of the law in his way reed is forced to take morality into his own hands for the sake of society at large a dimension of the film that is particularly <UNK> given director <UNK> controversial personal history the director <UNK> before the infamous <UNK> <UNK> suspected <UNK> and fellow <UNK> his film depicts suspects being <UNK> in for questioning and the <UNK> of the press on the grounds that the <UNK> public good justified the means these actions perhaps echo the director's sentiments at the time presumably accepting the <UNK> witch hunt and the <UNK> of civil rights it <UNK> in the light of presumed communist <UNK> of the entertainment industry in these times of terrorist <UNK> and state response such issues as they appear in the film are strikingly modern br br standout scenes in the film include a notable scene where <UNK> <UNK> the dying <UNK> as to the precise nature of his <UNK> presumed <UNK> cat like <UNK> stalks his victim across the room eventually <UNK> over the doomed man's sick bed holding <UNK> <UNK> head in his hands a striking evil <UNK> it's a gesture <UNK> the intimate nature of corruption whether moral or physical apparently the actors did many or all of their own stunts which leads to some other very dramatic scenes at the end as the police and health authorities close in on the villains under the <UNK> half <UNK> half <UNK> over the <UNK> <UNK> at the edge of the <UNK> pool must have been an experience very uncomfortable for palance but it is sequence that adds immensely to the <UNK> of it all br br occasionally less convincing elements distract the viewer apparently dr reed is left to fight a potential national <UNK> little government <UNK> perhaps just as astonishingly he never <UNK> himself <UNK> a dramatic turn which never <UNK> at the end of the film too the potential <UNK> has been <UNK> all <UNK> located a little too neatly but these weaknesses are more than <UNK> by the other <UNK> of a film that still makes for <UNK> and relevant viewing today
<START> i saw this when it first came to video my little sister got it as a gift and i was probably 12 at the time what stood out for me was the lack of mid movie conflict that so many movies have where the main characters get mad at each other because when it comes time to explain themselves they just don't say the one thing that you're shouting at the screen that would make sense of the whole deal that any person of reasonable intellect would know to say this is what i like the most about the movie i guess that the main characters don't do mean things to each other halfway through they don't break up and make up they just grow to like each other more as the movie goes on br br these two kids team up and though they seem at first to be from opposite sides of the track they're not that different <UNK> is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family and <UNK> was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone anyway i saw this movie posted on <UNK> and had to watch it again sure there's plot holes if you analyze the script and no <UNK> and <UNK> shouldn't be eating hot dogs since they would have been <UNK> in reality br br now what <UNK> from the film is it's unexpected <UNK> little kids under the age of 5 would probably be frightened by the scenes with dr <UNK> and the addition of him halfway through the movie though it's blatantly obvious in the first scene that he will make an appearance is too abrupt there should be a glimpse of him doing his show earlier in the movie perhaps to show that it's not that scary without the the dinosaurs i guess it just lacked any real present danger for the entire first half of the movie so that it lacks a little continuity when he appears for the second half br br considering the target audience who i'm sure can overlook the not so mind blowing animation and dialog issues i think i'll give it a pass on those factors too and just enjoy the story it's a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be <UNK> every 10 years i think
<START> i loved this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie <UNK> featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie you may remember me more clearly in the <UNK> scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie <UNK> in fact they double took me a few times so it's hard to miss that mistake thumbs up to full moon high wish it come to cable soon <UNK> <UNK> alexander <UNK> <UNK> i loved this movie in fact i loved being an actress in this movie <UNK> featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie you may remember me more clearly in the <UNK> scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie <UNK> in fact they double took me a few times so it's hard to miss that mistake thumbs up to full moon high wish it come to cable soon <UNK> <UNK> alexander br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> spoilers throughout br br the <UNK> is mostly an action movie and what action there is to <UNK> chases <UNK> and much much more it stars kim <UNK> and alec baldwin as the <UNK> <UNK> br br this is a remake and i have not seen the original but really didn't care for this one at all although <UNK> and baldwin have some nice screen chemistry but the movie itself didn't do it for me br br the <UNK> became really tiresome really quickly the plot is overshadowed by one fight chase after another and as the violence keeps <UNK> up <UNK> and baldwin retain their great looks no matter what <UNK> they maybe in in fact by the end of the movie they almost look better then in the beginning i don't think <UNK> eye makeup moves once during the whole picture br br this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen certainly not but it isn't very good and unless one is an action movie <UNK> i can't see really enjoying this movie because there's just not a lot here the <UNK> isn't terribly original either and goes every way from unnecessarily brutal to rather dull it really could have been better i think br br <UNK> and baldwin give ok performances but they don't have a lot to do except get chased and run for their lives sometimes less is more after seeing the same thing over and over again it gets stale didn't enjoy this one to much
<START> call me stupid but i absolutely loved the 2001 horror movie valentine it was so well made well written well acted well directed etc everything about it was wonderful there were parts that were relatively routine <UNK> death very funny www bleed me dry com completely horrifying and creepy <UNK> death and just plain heartbreaking the first scene i think the entire cast did a great job especially the three leads david <UNK> denise richards both of whom i met and got <UNK> from during the filming of this movie very nice people and <UNK> <UNK> br br i am very sick of people calling this movie another scream clone this movie is in no way a scream clone in fact this film runs rings around scream it actually makes sense scream was also not the only movie to feature a masked killer in it excuse me but it looks like scream was also a clone too <UNK> friday the 13th halloween and many other scary movies also featured masked killers i also think that the novelty of the <UNK> masked killer is brilliant it's so strange to see a sweet <UNK> face doing all of these horrible things another novelty the nose bleeding makes way for a fantastic ending the ending gives me chills every time i see it so even if you didn't like it the first time watch valentine again and give it another chance br br ps keep an eye out for my new website www love hurts <UNK> coming soon
<START> this is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here this is still the best action movie ever done the action movies of today are badly done the actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan the stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever the start where chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing the end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film the end stunt <UNK> down the pole crashing through the glass jackie was badly hurt
<START> i was aware of <UNK> admiration for the late works of the ones he considered like great <UNK> and that normal <UNK> generally considered as artistic failures as <UNK> or <UNK> very last movies yes the <UNK> des <UNK> also has its dark side but with les <UNK> <UNK> et de <UNK> it's as if rohmer himself wanted for what may be his last movie to <UNK> this tradition of great directors who made a last <UNK> movie by adapting <UNK> <UNK> with ridiculous aesthetic <UNK> witch just look like a parody of <UNK> last movies the ones he made for tv from <UNK> or <UNK> lives br br in his version of <UNK> rohmer refused to film real landscapes in order to give a re <UNK> of what may have been a middle age classical representation of things the director apparently changed his mind when the <UNK> century is involved and films actors dressed like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> text surrounded by contemporary trees and landscapes but the all thing looks even more ridiculous than <UNK> and its fake trees it's not that the story itself is stupid but the way rohmer mixes <UNK> with <UNK> seems so childish and <UNK> that it rapidly becomes <UNK> funny and i'm not even talking about the irritating <UNK> of the actors the annoying and sad <UNK> tries by <UNK> <UNK> the ridiculous soft erotic tone the poor musical <UNK> or the strange fascination for <UNK> br br the radical aesthetic of the film ultimately makes it looks like a joke which mixes a soft erotic movie made for tv with <UNK> <UNK> discussions <UNK> at the beginning of the movie rohmer teaches us that the original french region of the story is now <UNK> by <UNK> and that's why he had to film <UNK> in other parts of the country however i'm sure the movie would have look more modern and interesting if rohmer would have actually still filmed the same story in a modern area with same narrative <UNK> and artistically decisions this film may interest a few historians but most of the <UNK> may laugh at this last and sad <UNK> movie
<START> i don't know much about film making but good movies have to tell some sort of a story your characters have to start and complete their journey in last exit to brooklyn they may but its not in any satisfying way and i'm not meaning a happy ending just any ending br br last exit to brooklyn set in <UNK> brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike sets a number of story threads in motion most involve some of the most unlikeable characters to ever walk across a movie screen but last exit to brooklyn fails to bring these stories to any conclusion it leaves some of them <UNK> with no ending or <UNK> off into some bizarre <UNK> for an artistic ending br br two cases in point and they contain spoilers br br a sad <UNK> character an important character in the film is struck by a car and killed and that's it for him in the movie he's gone for good <UNK> from everyone's memory no reactions from his friends enemies lovers nothing br br in another thread the stupid clueless and secretly gay strike leader having been rejected by labor his gay lover and found out by the neighborhood thugs gets <UNK> by the thugs the closing scene to the beating shows the streets of brooklyn and the <UNK> are very very similar to those of nazi death camps and the scene drags on and on and on and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader and he's been <UNK> <UNK> and of course that's it for him too brain <UNK> gone br br bottom line no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film this movie is a depressing piece of <UNK> avoid it and if you don't be <UNK> it really deserves an <UNK> 17 rating for massive amounts of physical emotional and sexual brutality don't even let the teenagers watch
<START> they really can't get <UNK> than this film dealing with 3 losers who try to capture the college spirit during the <UNK> spring break <UNK> at many of our higher schools of learning the problem is that these losers try to do this 15 years after their college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being <UNK> to be the next vice president br br trouble is that her daughter is anything but popular but of course she comes out of all that the girls go through drunken <UNK> exotic dancing and other absolute nonsense br br it really can't get much worse than this awful film
<START> not that i want to be mean but this movie really surprised me a lot during the whole film i was like <UNK> what is this movie all about i don't get the animations at all probably this movie will only be suitable for those who belongs to the 1980s during the film there is a group of people walked out after the movie many people said that's it frankly speaking i cannot believe that this movie was awarded the best children film award if you are thinking of watching this film i strongly recommend you not to you will regret it i'm not joking you will find that you are just wasting both your time and money of you go and watch it
<START> this is a great ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late <UNK> obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was i can remember being freaked out by metal teens when i was a kid it doesn't help that i found a <UNK> grave in my <UNK> graveyard when i was ten turns out this weird metal kid had <UNK> up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan so maybe stuff like <UNK> me from metal for awhile but i love it now as a 24 year old br br i bought this dvd used for 6 bucks and i expected it to suck due to the lame cover but to my surprise it ruled it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal and you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in the crowd this movie is awesome if you love 80s metal and bad movies this one's for you 9 10
<START> i do see what my <UNK> saw in the youthful bette davis she's splendid throughout this almost <UNK> political comedy which actually stars warren williams as the political <UNK> constantly behind on his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is brilliant as his ex and i found myself rooting for her throughout the williams character is not at all sympathetic and he's not even a decent <UNK> br br guy <UNK> is one of the best at what he does as a candidate dragged out of his sleep at a political convention and nominated to be <UNK> in order to prevent a rival candidate from being nominated so this whole mess is <UNK> of <UNK> political <UNK> in a party called the <UNK> party if you're of a political mind you will probably see a party other than the one with which you are <UNK> reflected in the fictional <UNK> party of williams and <UNK> i could draw exact parallels but we're not here for that br br this is a good movie for those of us who love these old comedies if you've ever watched any of the old <UNK> <UNK> titles half shot at sunrise the <UNK> you'll find frank <UNK> as <UNK> right arm looking and behaving a lot like bert <UNK> he had me fooled br br yes both my wife and i recommend this one
<START> in a horror movie that is alright first off lets start with kate her main goals include getting laid by george clooney looking good and last but not least <UNK> everyone over gotta love her she had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish off this <UNK> but instead she ran i mean she didn't wanna bring guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was too late i mean the guy tried to rape her i cant get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot i mean who honestly would have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night the movie kept going on and as a result lost all its credibility
<START> i have never <UNK> flamenco before but somehow i feel like this movie was perfect the colors how blatant the dances were the <UNK> and the rivals all put together made a movie that seemed to have ended too soon i have seen other carlos <UNK> movies and i agree that this film may be his best production i feel that the best characteristics of his past films were put together and <UNK> to make <UNK> i appreciate the use of mirrors in revealing the activity going on behind the cameras while watching this movie i felt like i was sitting in a small restaurant in <UNK> <UNK> watching the dancers bang on a wooden <UNK> over a delicious fruit cocktail for me this movie fit like a <UNK> i don't know how i will be able to get a copy of this film in the us in the next few years i recommend this movie to anyone who is attracted to the <UNK> of other cultures it is safe to say that this movie is certainly on my favorites list
<START> along with brothers sisters six degrees was one of my favorite new dramas of fall 2006 br br great cast all around but really enjoyed the work of campbell scott the come back <UNK> and hope davis recent widow of journalist killed in iraq br br aside from the acting the writing was fresh and the acting superb the show was also shot in nyc the real city not the warner bros or some other <UNK> <UNK> adding a secondary <UNK> or realism br br i guess people are more interested in the latest survivor and other reality garbage too bad it didn't last
<START> yes some people have said that this movie was a waste of money but i'm the kind of die hard dragon world ending holy crap action movie fan br br but if you take it from my stand point this movie had some of the best action <UNK> were pretty <UNK> good but its that kind of movie that everything just fell <UNK> at the right time or just about when evil was <UNK> something fell in to save them at the right time though there were some funny lines and gangs throughout the movie which surprised me br br the 3d graphics were pretty damn good i mean for this kind of movie the 3d effects were great big battle that was shown in the trailers live up to whatever hype the movie had the fight between good and evil at the end was i have to to say could have been longer and slightly better it was still pretty good br br now on to the parts that i think could have been better the beginning was pretty good showing the parts that lead up to the big battles i mean if you don't really want to go see this movie in theaters then at least this is a <UNK> br br overall i loved the movie but the plot just fell into place to fast and fit <UNK> just to well
<START> this movie is rated a classic on sentiment not on any quality of movie making it moves from the unlikely to the unbelievable from the unrealistic to the ludicrous br br the unbelievable plot revolves around an attempt by two british soldiers and a <UNK> <UNK> to rescue a third soldier who has been captured by <UNK> indians in the later scene we see a full <UNK> with drum and <UNK> <UNK> into an <UNK> in the british army a sergeant does not order up a rescue attempt and if you get past that he does not attempt it with only one other soldier and an indian servant when there is a full <UNK> on hand the indian <UNK> are so incredibly inept it is laughable there are hundreds of them but they can't hold their prisoner or kill the two <UNK> of course not at one point we see the british soldiers throwing <UNK> of stone down from the <UNK> at the <UNK> who are scattered around the <UNK> in <UNK> one would have to have an <UNK> for a brain to think this would do any damage after cary grant as the rescued prisoner is shot he lies on the floor looking around at the water boy hardly the actions of someone who has been shot in the back the water boy <UNK> blows a <UNK> which comes from nowhere to sound the alarm this he does by standing up high on a wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad guys and we shed a tear as he keeps trying to sound more notes as he is repeatedly shot and the <UNK> call breaks up into feeble <UNK> instead of blowing the <UNK> while hiding behind cover as anybody with half a brain would do this scene has deservedly been <UNK> in comedy sketches if they wanted to make a buster keaton comedy they should have hired keaton and done it better
<START> i first saw this movie about 20 years ago and have never forgotten it it's beautifully filmed and the story keeps one <UNK> for the entire time it's difficult to believe this was made in 1946 as the tale is still fresh today and really makes one think i'm not very <UNK> regarding film technique however the special effects in this film are terrific considering when this was made in addition the acting is superb and the use of english and american actors quite astounding i recently purchased the dvd so now i'm able to watch whenever i wish i highly recommend anyone interested in post war british films to watch this
<START> my score for this crap 1 10 1 for the technical only everything else is very bad br br another film that makes no sense clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission br br while it's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth they are among the biggest <UNK> on the planet it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic br br we must believe that taking people for morons perhaps it was reason to believe since 99 of the films are crap because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios br br when you look at the price we give oscars we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others br br and oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense but it was not for education and health br br if you still want to listen to this s t press super fast forward button at least <UNK>
<START> his costume drama is ill cast and without charm br br george sanders was a superb character actor but he is thoroughly implausible here as the lead an <UNK> century rogue known for his philosophy and great good looks his <UNK> is of all people <UNK> <UNK> some frenchman then there's <UNK> <UNK> in a dark wig as the <UNK> daughter of a wealthy family carole <UNK> <UNK> best the movie opens with her in <UNK> she is a <UNK> and a naughty girl at that she disappears for a while but turns up in an <UNK> situation but she's good she was always an appealing actress here she is cast closest to her usual type of role br br it's meant to be a little naughty kind of <UNK> la la it ought to have had a light touch but it's a <UNK> affair from start to finish
<START> we loved the movie i am a mother to two little men i love having a movie i can watch with them where men have integrity and character <UNK> where money is not the most important thing and family's are forever and love means more then words br br i do wish we saw more of the davis family but over all i loved it left me with the same feeling the others did please don't be over we both wish actors would not change the new actors were good replacement tho br br my 9 year old son loved this movie too asked me to go buy them all he is a movie critic so for him to say this tells me something family should all see this move buy it for friends help bring back a time of values we will be reading the books now that we are hooked really hope to see more be blessed happy moving
<START> this movie is wonderful what <UNK> it from other 50's sci fi is the fact that the alien has no features no face eyes anything yet it can't be killed i especially like the idea that this film doesn't take place over a few days it takes place in one night lasting supposedly past midnight it's also scary that once the blob gets on you you can't get it off you're stuck in it as it <UNK> your flesh and slowly <UNK> your body my all time favorite 50's sci fi film and what is sometimes considered the quintessential one i can see why this <UNK> steve mcqueen to stardom all this and a catchy theme song how can you go wrong
<START> sure star wars a movie i have seen at least fifty times beats all the others in special effects but this film has every thing else br br it has horror non <UNK> romance robots witty <UNK> intelligence surprisingly good special effects and drama br br i saw this film a couple of years ago in a revival with a newly struck print and i was amazed at how well it held up today i thought the old 40's style <UNK> would look hokey but they somehow looked futuristic and <UNK> br br ann francis in here mostly short <UNK> and bare feet with a <UNK> innocence that is hard to beat still gets a rise out of me br br the <UNK> monster appearing in the ray <UNK> still scares the <UNK> out of me br br of course we all know that the great bird of the galaxy probably <UNK> much of star trek from this movie br br no one has yet to beat <UNK> the robot in terms of personality br br sorry <UNK> and <UNK> br br this movie overall is the standard that all other science fiction films will have to measure up to br br honorable mention for the haunting electronic score which kept us all on <UNK> and <UNK>

<START> if you are like me then you will love this great coming of age teen movie i think it is up there with <UNK> book of love high school usa shout <UNK> girl <UNK> all great movies set in the <UNK> 50s early 60s and it has a wonderful soundtrack not as many songs as in some of these type of movies but still great it is all so very funny at times and has a great love interest all the young cast are great i wish there were more type of these wonderful movies my favourite movie of all time is back to the future when marty <UNK> <UNK> back to 1955 well in these wonderful movies it stays in the <UNK> 50s early 60s there are some movies of this type better than this but not many
<START> princess victoria emily blunt is in line for the throne of england the present king william jim <UNK> is not well and may not live long however <UNK> scheming mother the <UNK> of kent miranda <UNK> and her <UNK> john mark strong want to force victoria to sign papers <UNK> them to be the <UNK> until she is older since she is only 20 years of age the young lady refuses despite john <UNK> her around it is another sign that victoria has a strong will and deep love for her country yet when william does pass away shortly after her 21st birthday victoria knows she has a heavy duty before her first she must surround herself with the right <UNK> to <UNK> wisely she chooses handsome lord melbourne paul <UNK> who although an older man is mentioned as a <UNK> for <UNK> which brings us to the young <UNK> second major decision sooner than not the young queen should <UNK> her future mate as it will bring <UNK> to her life and to those of the kingdom for an heir must appear in the coming years meanwhile in germany some distant relatives of the british royal family are <UNK> some plans as well handsome prince albert rupert friend of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> by his father to court the young english royal once he arrives at the palace he is smitten and the feeling seems to be mutual but since he is a minor player on the map of royal match making can he succeed in winning her heart this is a lovely film made even better by a completely winning performance by emily blunt as victoria yes she is beautiful but it is her intelligent reading of the role that scores <UNK> friend too does well as do the other actors including <UNK> richardson <UNK> strong what a repulsive role and the rest also the movie is <UNK> shot <UNK> and set making it a visual treat in every way if anything is lacking it is an extra dose of <UNK> as the film seems a bit too straightforward and <UNK> at times with a somewhat unimaginative edit however this is only a minor minor point of argument in an overall very successful and gorgeous film in short young and old should make time for young victoria it is a most worthy film among 2009 cinematic offerings
<START> overall i would have to say that i liked the movie some of the fight scenes are really good especially the fight against <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one point that really bothered me was the fact that they used an asian to play a black man i mean really talk about bad taste during a fight scene you see one of the fighters on the floor is laughing otherwise sammo copies bruce lee's fighting moves perfectly 5 out of 10 stars
<START> let this serve as a warning to anyone wishing to draw attention to themselves in the media by <UNK> their name to that of a well loved and well respected not to say <UNK> author in order to draw attention to their home movies out on dvd br br hyped to the <UNK> by its obviously talentless makers in fact <UNK> about only to be revealed finally as <UNK> inept in every department the fans of wells and of his book have been after the blood of its writer producer director since it appeared on dvd br br many good points have been made by the other comments users on this page particularly the one about using this as a teaching aid for film school students since this film does not even use the basic <UNK> of scripting editing continuity direction throughout its entire 3 hours running time it is possible the director did show up for the shoot certainly there was no one present who knew even remotely what they were doing br br an ongoing thread continues to <UNK> on this imdb page which should at least <UNK> the <UNK> of this witless drivel with a few laughs for their 9 00 <UNK> br br much was promised absolutely nothing was delivered except monty python meets war of the worlds with all the humour taken out br br <UNK> trash just unbelievable br br there are real independent film makers out there to be checked out people who actually try to work to a high standard instead of <UNK> their <UNK> about how great their movie is going to be br br people could do worse than keep an eye on brit film maker jake <UNK> evil aliens for example
<START> anyone who has seen <UNK> scott <UNK> film of the heartbreaking yet ultimately <UNK> life of the <UNK> david <UNK> will i am sure realise that 'the <UNK> is very poor in comparison it is as slow as a <UNK> i took five breaks answering <UNK> just to wake up the depiction of the homeless area way over the top and extremely self indulgent on a par i fear with the awful beach battle depiction in joe <UNK> other disaster <UNK> j fox performance was an extremely poor example of acting and lacked credibility from the <UNK> downey on the other hand although struggling with a badly paced film still manages to charm <UNK> it me or is he turning into george clooney in more ways than one comparing both these well known so called <UNK> though is unnecessary as the light that shines <UNK> as far as acting is concerned must be that of <UNK> <UNK> rush who's brilliant performance definitely <UNK> far <UNK> in my sky with both <UNK> and 'the <UNK> the written word wins far more <UNK> for empathy of subject read the book and <UNK> or wait for the dvd its bound to be in the bargain basement soon
<START> i know many people have a special <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> version of <UNK> story but for me this 1984 version is the one to beat my wife and i own a copy of this film on vhs and we watch it together every christmas eve i often remark that we could watch it on halloween too because it's a very creepy ghost story br br scott <UNK> as scrooge is <UNK> mean and nasty making his transformation all the more <UNK> and moving i think it's up there with his performance in <UNK> the spirits are all effective each one <UNK> than the last watching the dark floating <UNK> form of the spirit of christmas yet to come sends <UNK> down my spine every year and what a supporting cast david warner in particular is in top form as bob <UNK> as is <UNK> york as his wife br br i seem to recall that this version sticks closer to the original story than most others but i may be mistaken as it's been several years since i read it regardless this is a terrific christmas classic
<START> i had a really hard time making it through this move it was <UNK> slow and at times wondered when the plot of the movie would actually come to life br br this movie seemed to flow to slow and i kept on wondering when it was going to end i am normally a person who likes a good indie file every once in a while but this did not satisfy what i was looking for br br it seemed they tried to make to much out of this movie at one point it seemed to turn political which i am not a big fan of in movies if you are looking for a slow moving movie with little to no plot then this is the right movie for you as for me i felt i wasted 2 hours when i could of been doing something else
<START> i remember that the trailer for legend of zu was quite impressive and being a fan of a man called hero my all time favourite storm riders i decided that i must watch this one too i know that there is way to much <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> acting ability everywhere but he is my favourite hong kong <UNK> so far way better than nicolas <UNK> nevertheless and he is one of the factors that i enjoyed this movie without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end i even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this film they must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that the storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in i guess <UNK> <UNK> pulls the girls easily the story is not very intellectual and deep but that is not what you expect when <UNK> an action movie i wished there were more martial arts action with <UNK> and fist instead of battles with magical abilities but well that's life and it never goes the way you want it to and why did they sound like <UNK> planes in the battle through the sky in the end that's way too funny legend of zu cannot be a man called hero in my eyes but it flows like a <UNK> and that is not a bad thing at all if a company decides to <UNK> games on this movie i will not get <UNK> as it carries all the <UNK> elements good work please make more fantasy movies like this
<START> it's hard to put your finger on this one basically i suppose it's a comedy about an <UNK> rich drunk who falls in love with a <UNK> poor girl whom he wants to marry at the risk of being <UNK> by his family br br it has funny moments romantic moments and touching moments dudley moore is funny and somehow makes his self <UNK> character endearing <UNK> <UNK> is a convincing foil as the the <UNK> opposite he <UNK> but john gielgud steals the show as <UNK> wonderfully sarcastic butler br br it's corny but great fun with a memorable soundtrack and ran for nearly 3 months at our local <UNK>
<START> sky captain may be considered an homage to comic books pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres one <UNK> says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one <UNK> the films influences i don't think this is at all true one's expectations of the films fiction and serials that captain pays tribute to were entirely different especially so for those who experienced those <UNK> when they were children this film is almost completely devoid of the charm and <UNK> attraction of those of course we know the leads will get into and out of <UNK> but there has to be some tension and drama toward the climax of captain law and paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal they take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the <UNK> of a fallen <UNK> with 30 seconds left to tragedy of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgency br br one doesn't expect films like this to necessarily make sense one does expect them to be fun thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic captain has almost none remember when law and paltrow are being pursued by the <UNK> creatures and they reach a huge <UNK> which they cross via a <UNK> bridge well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side they can fly the <UNK> itself means nothing to them the bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape if the land across the <UNK> is <UNK> to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even if br br i know that paltrow and law both of whom have given fine performances in the past were playing types but both were pretty flat only <UNK> <UNK> who showed himself capable of great nuance here and angelina jolie seemed to give any <UNK> to their roles although <UNK> <UNK> seemed like he could have handled a little more if he'd only been given the chance he did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wasted br br the film had a great <UNK> but there are so many ways in which cgi <UNK> cgi works best when it is used for the <UNK> when it is used to create creatures who don't exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular when it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints there is no real sense of wonder a cgi mountain doesn't have any of the <UNK> or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does i know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it wasn't necessarily supposed to look real but shouldn't it feel that way it just didn't br br as for the weak and clichéd script homage is no excuse even so had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable the last samurai was as predictable as the days of the week and i am no fan of tom cruise but it had everything that captain didn't most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that sky captain most definitely did not br br i'd like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the 30's and 40's the original jay <UNK> flash or green <UNK> alan scott come to mind as being <UNK> for such treatment maybe the better more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film it would be hard to be worse
<START> first of all yes animals have emotions if you didn't know that already then i believe you are a moron but let's assume that none of us are morons we all know that animals have emotions and we now want to see how these emotions are <UNK> in nature correct br br what we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are human the filmmakers search high low for footage of animals engaged in human like behaviour and when it happens they say that monkey is almost human that's actually a direct quote br br everything is in human terms they waste time <UNK> about what makes dogs smile but not once do they mention what a <UNK> tail means the arrogance of these <UNK> is disgusting they even go so far as to show <UNK> dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hat br br i had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms i wanted to learn how animals <UNK> in their own languages but instead <UNK> keep falling back on <UNK> <UNK> observations and <UNK> add a <UNK> soundtrack and images of <UNK> celebrating christmas and this was enough to turn my stomach br br but it doesn't end there half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in <UNK> and experimental <UNK> all the camera shots of <UNK> are through steel bars and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one particularly <UNK> moment happens near the beginning though you have to be quick to notice it where a captive monkey says in sign language want out hurry go br br obscure references are made to stress <UNK> and psychological experiments which i <UNK> to imagine baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given <UNK> dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys <UNK> a mother figure and after 40 years of experiments the smug <UNK> pat themselves on the back for reaching their brilliant conclusion monkeys have emotions br br one <UNK> named <UNK> has been in a <UNK> cage since 1966 for that purpose and to this day she remains thus we get a brief glimpse again through bars of her <UNK> against a <UNK> wall with a rather lackluster expression personally i don't need to see any further experimental data <UNK> i apologize for our entire species
<START> mario lewis of the <UNK> enterprise <UNK> has written a definitive <UNK> page point by point line by line <UNK> of this <UNK> film which should be titled a convenient lie the website address where his <UNK> report which is titled a <UNK> guide to an <UNK> truth can be found at is www <UNK> <UNK> a shorter 10 page version can be found at www <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> once you read those <UNK> you'll realize that alleged global warming is no more real or dangerous than the <UNK> scare of 1999 which gore also <UNK> as he did the pseudo scientific film the day after tomorrow which was based on a book written by alleged <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as james the amazing <UNK> does to <UNK> and philip <UNK> does to <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> does to <UNK> <UNK> idiocy theories so does mario lewis does to al <UNK> movie and the whole global warming <UNK>
<START> i don't know if this is one of the <UNK> channel original movies but that's exactly what it feels like a cheap low budget action movie that was probably made very quickly it contains laughable effects lame dialog and one vaguely faded star to give some name brand recognition to it funny how many of the kids from <UNK> are doing cheap tv movies now br br ian <UNK> plays <UNK> who we know from history as the <UNK> who wiped out entire <UNK> of native people while <UNK> parts of north america here he is not played as a hero or even sympathetic but as a slimy <UNK> his character would probably be killed off if this weren't loosely based on a historical figure in this story <UNK> is on a brief <UNK> mission trying to find something of value to prove he deserves <UNK> to further explore america he and his men find a small tribe of <UNK> plagued by dinosaurs br br the actual hero of the story turns out to be lt <UNK> who proves to be honorable <UNK> and wise he knows the right thing to do in every situation which puts him at opposition with <UNK> as well as with the young ambitious aztec <UNK> of course the native girl who is supposed to marry the <UNK> scheming <UNK> falls for <UNK> <UNK> his anger towards the spanish <UNK> so it's all pretty cliché the dinosaurs are <UNK> with relative ease despite taking place in an area that seems wide open the story pretty much takes place in either the woods or the aztec village for 95 of the time so it isn't visually exciting either br br i didn't even recognize ian <UNK> they gave him a ridiculous wig and an unconvincing accent and somehow he disappeared into it he doesn't look or sound spanish for a second however making the casting choice wrong in every way if this movie had been released <UNK> he would have been <UNK> out for a <UNK> no question br br overall forgettable
<START> i am a big fan of the spaghetti western genre and i usually also like most of the cheaply made ones infamous director <UNK> <UNK> however is rightly known for some of the <UNK> <UNK> and well worst <UNK> to the genre the plots of <UNK> movies were usually very weak and since his talent was quite limited he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous spaghetti western names like <UNK> of <UNK> to the titles i the particular case of <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> of 1971 he just took the title of sergio <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> aka duck you sucker and added <UNK> the movie can be found under various titles <UNK> of death western story i personally bought it under the name <UNK> <UNK> which this movie shares with another <UNK> film with almost the same cast per <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> which is also entitled <UNK> <UNK> in the german language version br br the plot is rather weak it basically follows a guy named macho <UNK> jeff cameron and his involvement with two <UNK> outlaw gangs lead by butch cassidy jack <UNK> and <UNK> gordon mitchell br br the leading performance by jeff cameron is kindly stated not very convincing neither did i find jack <UNK> very good as <UNK> <UNK> b movie legend gordon mitchell however is always worth a try and although he probably wasn't a very good actor i always found his performances in the spaghetti westerns quite funny and original and he actually saved some of <UNK> movies such as the rather crappy <UNK> and <UNK> showdown in the west br br there is one very funny and original thing about <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> the great <UNK> kinski is playing a priest i could have imagined kinski in any role but before seeing this movie i would never have guessed that anybody would cast him as a priest kinski is once again great although he has only little screen time and one scene where he breaks up a fight is probably the only good scene in this one more interesting thing about this film is that the legendary director and king of sleaze joe <UNK> did the cinematography br br <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> is a cheap crappy film but nevertheless it has some funny moments being a spaghetti western <UNK> i found it fun to watch but if you're not never mind this movie or watch it only for the purpose of seeing kinski play a priest 3 10
<START> i saw this movie a couple years back i <UNK> sleep and there was nothing on so i <UNK> it what really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing richard gets tied up in chicken wire and <UNK> starts making out with <UNK> girl while she's unconscious then <UNK> buddy <UNK> is playing some stupid song on his guitar by the next morning it shows <UNK> girl talking to <UNK> and <UNK> and then she walks back to richard and looks at him while he's still tied up then they play some happy music and the movie is finished i mean what happened did they <UNK> up and what was she saying to those 2 guys <UNK> and <UNK> its to puzzling and to poor to i can't stand movies that are disturbing and don't make sense this was the worst film i've ever seen since the 90's version of lord of the flies
<START> if you want to watch a film that is oddly shot oddly lit weird stories of these men and one woman who enjoy beating the crap out of each other if you want to enjoy a story that goes nowhere of these two guys one a boxer and the other a gay man then you should watch this film br br after watching this film i almost felt as badly <UNK> up and cut up like the director of the film himself beat the hell out of me br br this is a movie where one is not meant to watch for plot or for great acting this is a film to <UNK> at in horror and wonder a lot like watching an airplane crash or a train wreck br br if you want to watch a great movie a good movie a b movie or even a mediocre movie this movie is not it br br a warning to all who watch this film please don't eat beforehand you might want to <UNK> by the end of the film
<START> this is a great movie that everyone should see it plays like a dean <UNK> book br br bill <UNK> performance was great in that it really seems like he believes in what he is saying and doing br br i don't know why viewers have to read in some kind of <UNK> for religious murder in to the film it is fiction the ending is surprising but fictional so what i think that is what makes this movie so good spoiler do not read further if you <UNK> seen the movie throughout the movie the viewer is continually shocked at the sickness of <UNK> character the impact on the children and the way the children handle this outrageous conduct and then at the end it turns out to be true god has put him on a mission to rid the world of demons paxton is not <UNK> as other viewers suggest sure he is given info that he couldn't have known otherwise but the movie goes further to show how god is protecting adam through the convenient video quality problem and the complete lack of memory of the second fbi agent the film isn't <UNK> christian murder it is merely taking the viewer on a very unexpected ride
<START> i love this film it's one of those i can watch again and again it is acted well by a good cast that doesn't try too hard to be star <UNK> br br the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an <UNK> turd of a movie or an action thriller either would have killed the film completely br br the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel good factor throughout br br it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of <UNK> no that's not a spoiler
<START> certainly <UNK> has some of the best horse riding scenes <UNK> and <UNK> landscape cinematography you'll likely see but this isn't what makes a film good it helps but the story has to shine through on top of these things and that's where <UNK> wanders br br the story is stilted giving it a sense that it was thrown together simply to make a cool movie that looks great not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story takes place and it's blatantly obvious with names like lee and <UNK> if movie makers want to <UNK> us in a culture like the <UNK> and the <UNK> they damn well better use actors actresses that look the part br br <UNK> <UNK> a prophecy <UNK> love and respect a love interest that <UNK> our heroes are all touched on but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will brush them aside in favor of the next battle sequence the next action horse scene or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape br br it is worth mentioning that there were some significant changes made to <UNK> during its filming specifically the director and cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> director was replaced by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> cinematographer was replaced by dan <UNK> in one respect <UNK> seems to have the better eye since his visions of the lands made the final cut that we see here definitely a good thing however the changing over to <UNK> as director may not have been the <UNK> choice from what i'm seeing here the focus is on the battles and not the people which i sense comes from <UNK> eyes and not <UNK> a true travesty br br the most shameful aspect is that this could've been a really fantastic film with both character and action focuses unfortunately the higher ups apparently decided that action was what was needed and took the cheap intellectually speaking way out br br even though i can't give this film a positive rating it is worth watching simply for the amazing cinematography work but that's all
<START> i bought <UNK> on ebay a while ago i watched parts and deemed it just too dumb to review again the excessive amount of <UNK> <UNK> at the beginning is just plain <UNK> not to mention the whip around wind sounds my friends and i made a super low budget movie and the effects still <UNK> this crap fest br br as for the amount of mistakes in this movie there are way too many to count i knew one of the actors believe it or not he was my theatre teacher ha br br final verdict don't bother with this horror flick br br 3 stars out of a possible 73
<START> this is something new br br there's a coup <UNK> and a couple of irish documentary filmmakers are right inside of it br br a <UNK> elected president who uses his power to bring <UNK> to his people and encourages them to read the <UNK> is being <UNK> by the private media openly as dictator mentally unstable new hitler etc without <UNK> from the <UNK> side like say <UNK> them via bullets and other traditional <UNK> methods oh and they still claim that they are being <UNK> of course br br see how the media <UNK> about their own role in the coup <UNK> on tv after they <UNK> the government with the help of <UNK> <UNK> how much more stupid can you get br br and see how the people of <UNK> march to the palace holding the <UNK> in their hands and <UNK> their elected government br br this sounds like a hollywood fairytale but it happened for real against the explicit wishes of the usa the documentary is a historical masterpiece shot from the center of the action <UNK> and totally embarrassing for the prime supporters of the coup the good <UNK> freedom loving <UNK> usa who still channel large amounts of money to <UNK> political opponents br br also highly entertaining and exciting 10 points
<START> <UNK> of a geisha is a beautifully filmed movie there is no doubt about that and the acting is generally excellent at least in terms of how it portrays the characters as they are scripted br br however so many details small and large are just wrong that it just bothers me too much to be able to enjoy it fully a small detail that <UNK> the kind of lack of sensitivity of sorts is one scene no this does not spoil anything where <UNK> rings a bell that hangs at the door of the house where <UNK> lives on a snowy winter day the bell she's <UNK> is a <UNK> or wind <UNK> that is only left hanging outside of houses in japan in the summer people in traditional japanese homes didn't have <UNK> they just opened the door and announced themselves you may think this is such a trivial detail but i would <UNK> this to a movie made about america where a christmas <UNK> is hanging on the door in july and no one thinks anything of it and don't even get me started on the totally wrong <UNK> given to the <UNK> and geisha which is vaguely pan asian chinese kung fu ish and nothing like real thing i think this rather <UNK> attitude towards the culture they are trying to portray really comes out in the attitudes and the portrayals of people and situations too br br so i suppose that the less you know about japanese culture and the world of the geisha and <UNK> in <UNK> which is what <UNK> is then i suppose the more you will enjoy this i honestly think this movie could have been so much better as it is it's just another hollywood version of exotic japan
<START> after high school <UNK> best friends alice and <UNK> decide to take a trip to thailand whilst they are there they meet a charming australian guy named nick after spending some time with nick he asks them if they want to take a weekend trip to hong kong with him they agree at the airport though they are get <UNK> for <UNK> drugs and then get convicted for 33 years in a <UNK> prison for something they say they haven't done not really knowing what to do they end <UNK> <UNK> hank an american lawyer who lives in thailand with his wife word has it that if you have the money he can help you things start of well but they still can't get out br br the movie is really good because it doesn't let on what's going to happen and it's interesting all the time i couldn't believe the ending though it was one of those endings where you don't know the 100 truth but you still kind of know what really happened with nick and the drug <UNK> because of the <UNK> <UNK> etc br br claire danes and kate beckinsale both give quite good performances here <UNK> performance was a little weak though both danes and <UNK> characters friendship is good but could of seemed stronger paul walker even has a small uncredited role here br br anyway i thought <UNK> palace was a good movie and i give it a 7 10
<START> most who go to this movie will have an idea what it is about a man loses his entire family and even his dog in a flight from boston that <UNK> morning of september 11 2001 what you probably won't know before seeing this film is this how that would feel what do you do with that and how would that affect you and the way you relate to every waking day the story unfolds painfully slow from the gate and then <UNK> up nicely as it <UNK> a little speed while the recently <UNK> relationship between dentist alan johnson don cheadle and ex college roommate charlie <UNK> adam sandler <UNK> and begins to take shape characters appear in this film whose presence initially seem obligatory and not well developed but in fact stay with this story and you find that the simplicity of each character is what makes this story believable and accurate real people inhabit a real situation <UNK> they can do little but stand aside while one amongst them <UNK> the pain inside charlie's soul is subtly evident from first introduction and grows as we learn more about his character <UNK> revealed by sandler as layers of an <UNK>  one <UNK> at a time with <UNK> and weight combined it's so subtle a performance that he <UNK> up on you and gets inside your head while you are watching him on screen <UNK> alan johnson is equally subtle and very don cheadle always watchable the ease that's apparent when <UNK> on screen speaks to his <UNK> acting skills <UNK> relationship with charlie <UNK> is delicate in <UNK> just as the situation would demand <UNK> doesn't want friendship nor anybody <UNK> into his <UNK> life and yet the likable quality that alan owns is simple and honest enough to intrigue even a <UNK> like charlie it is alan who has the task of <UNK> opening up charlie's carefully sealed life there is inherent danger in the process the more alan <UNK> charlie to open up going so far as engaging the services of friend and psychologist angela <UNK> <UNK> tyler the <UNK> the danger of pushing charlie over the edge it's an <UNK> that charlie <UNK> on each and every waking moment and one he has learned to <UNK> through sheer <UNK> of denial he has denied everything that <UNK> existed for him in order to exist with his loss unfortunately his grief is one thing he cannot deny sandler <UNK> so deeply into his character's pain during the story's unfolding that by the time he meets his demons head on the viewer shares his pain almost equally alan stands beside charlie throughout this <UNK> process at the risk of <UNK> up his own perfect home life run with admirable grace and <UNK> by wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> smith while <UNK> to charlie's <UNK> alan looks <UNK> and <UNK> his own silent screams at the death of the independence he once owned and the boy he has lost becoming a man his reward for helping charlie is helping himself <UNK> with what he has lost the theme is much like the fisher king another story of a man who <UNK> himself to the point of madness from sorrow and loss like the fisher king the story concludes with the traditional there is someone for everyone theme reign over <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> played by the wonderful amanda plummer in the fisher king is donna <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a woman on the verge of breakdown and <UNK> patient of <UNK> who turns out to be the just unstable enough to <UNK> charlie's borderline insanity it's a good ending to the story but the one element probably least likely to ring true then again maybe there really is someone for everyone <UNK> macdonald <UNK> <UNK>
<START> question what do you call 100 film critics buried up to their <UNK> in sand answer a good start well i don't know peter mattei from adam but if he is the budding auteur his filmography suggests love in the time of money is a good start a classy shoot with whimsical music box style music this flick looks at a chain of <UNK> relationships as it moves from person a to person b to person c etc and back again ending with persons a b in <UNK> fashion the film gently <UNK> the unhappy circumstances of nine people with finely rendered <UNK> beginning and ending with a street whore and her client the downside of this film is the lack of a story which may have something to do with the many critical <UNK> it received i watched the <UNK> angels in america last night and was bored at the end while this little <UNK> of character studies kept me spell bound use caution i may be the only person who really liked this flick b
<START> i am only 11 years old but i discovered full house when i was about five and watched it constantly until i was seven then i grew older and figured full house could wait and that i had more important things to do plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it <UNK> with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too <UNK> br br then i realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and i once again became addicted to it full house has made me laugh and cry it's made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the world of full house plus a mom i have heard people say full house is cheesy and unbelievable but look at the big picture three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver the sisters fight and get their feelings hurt the three men who live with the girls can get into <UNK> at times what's any more real than that br br if anything the show has lifted me up when i'm down and brought me up even higher when i thought i was at the point of complete happiness i have <UNK> like a <UNK> at the show and gained a massive <UNK> over mary kate and ashley olsen of course <UNK> duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the <UNK> babies i have ever seen they are great actresses and seem to be very nice people
<START> this movie was two and a quarter excruciating hours someone please tell me what the point was br br i mean i understand the historical setting it's supposed to be about a <UNK> group of <UNK> <UNK> terrorists on the <UNK> kansas frontier taking revenge against all northern <UNK> and <UNK> during the u s civil war but aside from gratuitous violence there wasn't really much of a point to this movie perhaps it was a political statement that war is really nothing much more than gratuitous violence if that was the point it was done quite well but i don't think that was the point i think the producers really thought they were making a worthwhile movie here but as far as i was concerned there was a complete lack of any plot it seemed like i was watching a <UNK> novel come to life with the characters looking like what you would see on the covers of such novels br br this movie should be burned along with some of the towns this gang <UNK>
<START> i remember watching this late at night on black and white tv long before a live action version was so much as a <UNK> in peter jackson's eye and being very impressed finally getting my hands this week on a vhs copy that was being thrown away and isn't that just par for the course i had the chance to <UNK> this film and found that it still stands up quite well although it's not quite the success that memory had painted br br i have to confess to a certain bias here some reviewers <UNK> themselves as confirmed jackson lovers others as jackson <UNK> i'm not exactly either i was a <UNK> of the bbc radio adaptation by brian <UNK> originally broadcast in 1981 and instantly <UNK> the voice of <UNK> here peter <UNK> would <UNK> this performance almost note perfect for the radio three years later br br i must say however that where i found jackson's films an increasingly indulgent disappointment the bakshi version for all that it has been cut to the bone is actually more accurate yes there are the usual understandable changes here it is <UNK> rather than <UNK> who is <UNK> for <UNK> as the <UNK> sent from <UNK> to meet the party and there is a great deal of <UNK> of the action the only exception to the latter as others have <UNK> is the oddly extended sequence at the ford of <UNK> where the <UNK> having demonstrated a chilling ability to freeze and draw back <UNK> in mid flight which they <UNK> again when he defies them after crossing the river then for some unexplained reason simply chase after him in a prolonged straight <UNK> which is initially nightmarish but pointless plot wise and definitely goes on too long i would also agree that the <UNK> is <UNK> due partly to bad animation and that <UNK> <UNK> his arms too much br br but having watched both approaches to the film i feel more than ever that the animated route is the one to take in a tale that is half myth oddly enough one thing that is included is a <UNK> of <UNK> story of <UNK> and <UNK> the extreme <UNK> required by live action filming where everything from monsters to mail shirts has to be created in detail to appear on camera is counter <UNK> <UNK> faced or cgi monsters are less monstrous than <UNK> drawn <UNK> heroic costumes tend to look rather silly worn on real bodies and <UNK> or <UNK> with non human body proportions are easy to <UNK> but hard to film convincingly many reviewers have <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> in the woods with its crippled half human movements as one of the scariest moments in the film it certainly frightened me silly when i saw it for the first time alone in the dark br br the extreme <UNK> of the introduction plus a voice over done with great skill and economy to sum up the back story in a few sentences works very well to depict an almost mythical era and the change to the comic book <UNK> of the <UNK> i particularly like the <UNK> <UNK> effectively to the similar change in tone of <UNK> <UNK> i did feel that there were some missed opportunities where the potential of animation could have been used to great effect <UNK> threatening <UNK> with his true power in the opening scenes <UNK> seeming to become a <UNK> like creature under the influence of ring lust at <UNK> and <UNK> famous temptation speech all were drawn more or less straight where it would have been trivial to <UNK> the scene to reflect the <UNK> changed <UNK> but generally speaking the changes in detail and palette <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> bright colours re <UNK> at <UNK> and in the <UNK> <UNK> dirty <UNK> and <UNK> for <UNK> and the desolate lands work well to reflect the mood of the various episodes where a live action approach simply doesn't allow you to <UNK> the background or sketch in a <UNK> setting br br as a fan i didn't care for either jackson's or bakshi's depiction of <UNK> again i feel that the radio <UNK> was the best <UNK> i've come across of a beautiful slightly uncanny <UNK> paradise caught out of time and i feel that bakshi got the <UNK> singing at this point pretty badly wrong but i do like the little montage at this point showing the various members of the company relaxing together after their <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> giving a <UNK> <UNK> lesson here is as charming and equally <UNK> a spectacle as <UNK> engaging with the <UNK> in <UNK> in the jackson version br br the depiction of <UNK> as convincingly <UNK> ranger is good throughout this film viggo <UNK> <UNK> jesus look really didn't work for me although it would have been interesting to see how they planned to <UNK> <UNK> the character in the second half for <UNK> benefit john hurt <UNK> gives a sterling vocal performance as does a <UNK> william <UNK> in the part of <UNK> the <UNK> are i suspect intended to reflect contemporary youth as audience <UNK> figures i find the animated style their proportions are much more <UNK> than those of the human characters works well to <UNK> them and the whole <UNK> <UNK> thing as drawn here comes across as much more plausible than in more literal depictions including much fan art br br personally i have less <UNK> to <UNK> as <UNK> he was always a fairly <UNK> type than to <UNK> <UNK> illogical they were both <UNK> after all although i am clearly in a minority here br br the big flaw in this picture is always going to be the fact that it was an unfinished project with a bizarre tacked on voice over ending attempting to resolve matters a pity it would have been interesting not to mention less frustrating to see what bakshi planned to make of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> never mind the dead
<START> i got to see an early preview of this movie and i hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out <UNK> 3rd it stars andy <UNK> from saturday night live as <UNK> rod <UNK> he's plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father when we meet him he's jumping a mail truck on his mo <UNK> yes a mo <UNK> and almost makes it this would be worthy of a <UNK> movie if he wasn't honestly trying to do this <UNK> fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl next door denise she seems to like rod enough to join his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> also snl plays his half brother kevin who documents the stunts with a camcorder sissy <UNK> plays <UNK> mom marie she <UNK> frank powell played by ian <UNK> <UNK> a real tough guy who enjoys beating rod in some real drag out <UNK> it's clear that <UNK> not going to earn <UNK> respect till he can beat him we find out frank needs a 50 000 heart transplant and rod is determined to raise the money just so he <UNK> beat his <UNK> once he's <UNK> and prove himself a man a long fall down a mountain side convinces rod to <UNK> <UNK> on one stunt rod sets out to get seed money by <UNK> for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life like the human torch at a children's birthday party there were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts just when all hope and money is lost along comes a <UNK> who saves the day by getting the 15 school <UNK> rod wants to jump he gets <UNK> broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get <UNK> rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle the whole town turns out and the world tunes in does he make the jump does he get the girl do they raise the <UNK> does frank get his ass beat by rod wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out
<START> although <UNK> <UNK> johnny dangerously is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen it's a movie that should be watched closely some of the funny bits are done in passing and do not have the usual amount of attention drawn to them for instance keep an eye on michael keaton's use of the <UNK> gun at the pet store and also on the documentary style years that appear at the beginning of scenes it's one of those rare movies where the humor hits you unexpectedly even though you know it's a comedy amy <UNK> the director is really sharp here if you enjoyed her better known films fast times at <UNK> high clueless european vacation etc you should give this one a look br br michael keaton is extremely likable in the title role and the supporting cast <UNK> dunne maureen <UNK> joe <UNK> peter boyle is excellent highly recommended
<START> the legend of bloody jack is set in the <UNK> wilderness starts as a relative of some murderous deceased <UNK> <UNK> reads <UNK> the evil dead 1982 style from an ancient spell book in an attempt to <UNK> him he succeeds not being a big believer in family <UNK> the <UNK> dude kills his relative two days later ray travis quentin young along with his sister dawn <UNK> <UNK> her boyfriend nick craig <UNK> four of their friends pull up outside a <UNK> <UNK> cabin the evil dead style with a view to a relaxing weekend in the wilderness <UNK> the killer <UNK> dude show's up with his axe starts to slaughter the friends one by one br br edited written executive produced directed by todd <UNK> this is a pretty rotten modern slasher flick the likes of which are killing the horror genre for me i'm just not a big fan of ultra low budget horror films with the production values of a holiday video the script is absolutely terrible in every way for 80 minutes it has every bad slasher cliché the character's are awful the dialogue is terrible it's hard to care about anyone or anything in this pretty worthless excuse for a teen slasher film the teens are even more annoying stupid than usual the script is more moronic predictable flawed than usual the killer <UNK> dude is just lame then there's the final 10 minutes or so which if you make it that far believe it's tough going produces one of the worst twist ending in slasher film history which as far as i'm concerned <UNK> fun at us the paying audience who has just had to sit through 90 minutes worth of crap i will now spoil the ending so anyone who doesn't want to know it stop reading now basically just before the end of the film it cuts back to ray telling a story it turns out he was telling the story of what we had just seen nick dawn everyone else <UNK> him for telling such a bad story i felt their pain then proceed to pick holes in it laugh at it from saying why did they stand around argue why didn't they pick the axe up such things i felt like this was <UNK> fun at the audience as those were the sorts of things i was asking myself while watching this crap to have it shoved down my throat made perfectly clear that the makers knew the script was crap could see all the holes in it went for a twist ending which <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> 80 minutes which we have just had to sit through remember is just a little grating then to add insult to injury the <UNK> dude turns up kills everyone within two minutes why didn't he do that to start with it would have saved everyone a lot of time br br director <UNK> turns in a real mess this has the worst continuity between night day in a film i have ever seen the whole film is meant to set at night i suspect the makers tried to use the day for night process but it didn't work most of it looks like it is set during the day for example look at when lisa is trapped in the bathroom she climbs out of the window it is clearly pitch black outside when we are looking out from inside the bathroom but when she falls to the ground the films cuts to an exterior shot it's bright daylight then there's the fact ranger vince says we can't get a search party out here until 'the <UNK> <UNK> it was supposed to be night then several minutes later when he walks outside it looks like it's the middle of the day he is actually carrying around a torch which is clearly on he is clearly pointing it in the directions where he is looking like it's night anytime there is a scene set in the cabin look at the windows it's pitch black outside when the ranger walks in through the door to start with is also another clear example the continuity in this film is simply the worst i have ever seen there isn't much gore there are a few scenes of an axe going into people bodies but nothing memorable it's not scary there's no tension or atmosphere the appalling day night continuity is just so distracting because it's so obvious br br technically the film is rock bottom again the continuity between night day has to been seen to be believed how bad it is the special effects are poor they couldn't even afford to show a car blowing up even though it's pretty vital to the plot this has amateur hour written all over it from start to finish the acting is absolutely brilliant everyone involved should get an oscar <UNK> only joking not really they were utterly awful even the girls who got their breasts out weren't very good looking br br the legend of bloody jack is just an awful teen slasher flick it looks like it was shot on a camcorder without the use of a <UNK> or <UNK> it has awful effects is boring has a twist ending which is either the most insulting in horror film history or i've got it totally wrong it's the most clever not recommended watch a decent slasher from the 70's or 80's to remind you how they should be done
<START> i like david <UNK> artistic photographs of nude women at the border of <UNK> sometimes erotic though never pornographic someone else liked them too because my david hamilton books were stolen in one book were seen a few pictures of a young boy obviously nude intimate with a young woman older than he also nude though <UNK> there was strong sexual <UNK> new territory for david hamilton which proved to be either stills from the movie <UNK> <UNK> or perhaps photos taken on set br br the art of still photography unfortunately does not automatically translate to cinematography soft focus becomes out of focus and <UNK> angles become confusing perhaps because in motion they cannot be considered you either see it or miss it and there's no time to observe to comprehend the movie is supposed to be a farce and funny things do happen but it doesn't hang together perhaps because the story develops so slowly and one may wonder just what's going on eventually the 14 year old <UNK> has <UNK> with his cousin but it's soft core with no <UNK> contact shown on camera since it's a farce we have a disappointing virgin and an embarrassing caught in the act gag and having caught them <UNK> father even gives him a cigarette to complete the experience in fairness the film is in french and <UNK> to french cinematic forms which may just be too subtle for most americans even with english subtitles to help us <UNK> along br br it's been suggested that this film is child pornography and that certainly results from today's climate where sexual exploitation of children is clearly a serious problem nobody in their right mind wants to <UNK> or appear to <UNK> the sexual abuse of children so there's practically no room left for children to be seen in even the <UNK> erotic context without immediately <UNK> <UNK> over sexual violence and exploitation guys will think lucky <UNK> even as they agree that sex and children in the movies is a bad thing all the while still wishing they could have been a <UNK> at that age women too may have similar thoughts but all such <UNK> must be pushed out of one's conscious mind hysterically the worst <UNK> have become automatic and matters of children and sex are <UNK> avoided too bad since sexual awakening is a real human experience <UNK> all children do grow up and become sexual beings as <UNK> does it's a fit literary subject cinema included but taboo under the threat of sexual violence against children david hamilton i think was taking a risk to make a movie on this topic even in 1980 he was somewhat successful at exploring this sensitive topic and unfortunately we're unlikely to see better in the near future for fear of the child pornography label
<START> i'm going to write about this movie and about <UNK> the in famous scene in it so you are warned if you haven't seen the movie yet this are just my thoughts why i think the movie fails in the end pun intended br br acting wise rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger a teenager in other words the villain guy is good but loses his evil touch right before the end if he really never changes then why would he let a woman tie him up he wouldn't period then we also have the bartender 2nd rape dude actually i don't think you would need him at least not for the 2nd rape but more about that later on br br let's <UNK> the story <UNK> character is sexually insecure might even have lesbian <UNK> see her scene with a female friend this wasn't intentional as rosario states herself but there is sexual tension between them <UNK> character meets a guy who is a sexual predator in all the bad senses but he makes an impression on her br br rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before i beg to <UNK> because she acts as if it is her first boyfriend which also <UNK> her phone conversation with her mother talking about her mother here's another problem after the first rape takes place <UNK> character doesn't tell anyone what happened <UNK> that her relationship with her mother is a very close one nothing of that gets explored after that if <UNK> character wouldn't call her mother anymore or would behave strangely the mother would be worried like crazy there was so much potential here also her female friend we see her at the party it's obvious there is something going on and boom she is gone br br the first rape is almost unbearable to watch but feels like a <UNK> when you compare it to the ending rape which feels like you're getting hit with a <UNK> hammer after rape no 1 we get too stretched out scenes threads are opened such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian as one guy states who tried to hit on her but left in the open no real social contact is established if you leave the bartender guy out who is involved in the 2nd and last rape scene it's apparent that he isn't a nice guy and his character <UNK> fleshed out a bit but when <UNK> character meets her rapist in class again his being in the movie seems pointless we get the point that <UNK> character isn't the same anymore that she went bad and is able to hurt people too many scenes show exactly that her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff back to rapist 1 who <UNK> on a test gets caught by <UNK> character and they decide to hang out together again really as absurd as that sounds the guy meets up with her not without us having seen him beforehand with another girl very likely that he raped her too although we never see anything of that fortunately and his football career well career is a stretch and he is <UNK> this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works but then again is too cliché to stay with you so rapist 1 <UNK> to <UNK> character why exactly because he promised her it was her day again really a guy like that never loses control especially with a woman he raped before i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something but letting him submit like that just feels wrong another possibility would have a drug in his drink br br so rapist 1 <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and let's <UNK> character tie him on a bed seriously that's just crazy but what comes next is even <UNK> first she talks to him then she <UNK> him up and forces an object into him this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one this isn't about what this guy deserves or not it's just intense and of course that was what they were aiming for now after she is done the bartender guy comes in and rapes rapist 1 if this really should work as a revenge movie it would have been better if <UNK> character herself would have been doing all the revenge having a henchman doing the job takes away everything that was built up br br this isn't supposed to be entertaining enjoyable it's a hard watch it is art house but the 10 minute i didn't count rape scene at the end just <UNK> everything <UNK> character is more or less only watching what happens which brings me to the biggest disappointment br br <UNK> comparison <UNK> had the rape scene but the movie went on even if it was back into time rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this first that comes a bit too late that should see her say that after the initial rape and secondly and most importantly this is where the art house movie should've come in it is more interesting seeing were <UNK> character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope with what she had done but then again she didn't actually physically do that much see above a broken character that the movie cuts off br br good intentions <UNK> and rosario had worked before but failing to convey most of the things they set out to do even if you can see what they meant it has to be convincing otherwise it doesn't work not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are
<START> this movie might not put the catholic church in the best light but it is telling a story based on true events unfortunately not everything in life including religion are all nice and <UNK> sometimes people and groups do things that at the time seem like the right thing but in <UNK> do not look as great as they once did a love divided tells the story of a family yes it does <UNK> religion but really the story is about a family and that family's ability to stay together no matter what is thrown at them this film is also based on true events which is not to say that this story scene by scene is true but if you were to look at news <UNK> from that time period you would be able to see that neither <UNK> handled the incident in a way that was helpful towards the family both <UNK> are at fault here the catholic church for forcing such a <UNK> on the family in the first place and not <UNK> to the violence that came with it and the <UNK> church for telling the mother that she should just <UNK> her husband and his priest and not put up a fight in this case both let this family down i believe that the film does a good job in showing this struggle in both the church and the family it in no way shape or form is putting down the catholic church just the opposite it shows how one incident can change the course of that <UNK> ideas and how one person can have an effect far more reaching then just themselves
<START> this is even worse than the original game of death a <UNK> incoherent storyline leads to billy lo falling from a helicopter to the ground below killing him as we're left to follow his younger brother bobby lo so not only do we start out following some bruce lee clone the film kills that one off and has us follow another one thirty minutes into the story the main reason to watch this one is when bobby lo fights a lion which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume <UNK> lee <UNK> is also the villain who is usually pretty awesome but his screen time is significantly small mainly watched this and the original game of death because they're a part of the bruce lee <UNK> set it's no wonder they're included with lee's finished works no one would buy them otherwise
<START> the plot for descent if it actually can be called a plot has two noteworthy events one near the beginning one at the end together these events make up maybe 5 of the total movie time everything and i mean everything in between is basically the director's desperate effort to fill in the minutes i like disturbing movies i like dark movies and i don't get troubled by gritty scenes but if you expect me to sit through 60 minutes of <UNK> dark literally scenes with no storyline you have another thing coming rosario dawson one of my favorite actresses is completely wasted here and no she doesn't get naked not even in the <UNK> 17 version which i saw br br if you have a couple of hours to throw away and want to watch descent take a <UNK> instead you'll probably have more interesting dreams
<START> it is first and foremost a chick flick it is a romantic comedy there is a fair balance between the two this particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet fight scenes i don't think any <UNK> were used or if they were they weren't flat out blatant it isn't a terribly complicated movie so it easy on the brain no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning pretty simple good chemistry between the leads and a fun watch i'd like it if they made brought out the full potential of the girls looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of pretty i'd watch it again with a girl
<START> four years after making his directorial debut with the art house <UNK> welcome to l a alan <UNK> shows us what he really wanted from hollywood was to be one of the guys <UNK> is a frat boy <UNK> complete with <UNK> <UNK> horny <UNK> art <UNK> in a <UNK> up wheelchair and meat <UNK> at the wheel meat <UNK> playing travis w <UNK> is actually a rather charming presence on the screen and perhaps in a smaller role in a better movie he might indeed be <UNK> but <UNK> king's script is full of stereotypical redneck humor and helpless meat <UNK> is kept wide eyed and moronic alice cooper roy <UNK> hank williams jr and <UNK> all make appearances and all look embarrassed they certainly should <UNK> is one bad trip no stars from
<START> i just got puzzled why damn fox canceled the <UNK> although <UNK> was not as good as <UNK> which is excellent indeed i like it so much that i even thinking about buying dvd on amazon failed i am a chinese student and it's <UNK> for me to get a international credit card and i just hope fox can bring back da someday somehow
<START> despite reading the initial comments from someone who curiously disliked the film why is the only negative comment very first on the list it was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it obviously the church wanted to stress certain points and portray the prophet joseph smith in a positive manner thats the whole idea and in fact those points were extremely effective we already know joseph smith was human but despite that and all of the horrific negative attempts <UNK> on by the <UNK> it showed just how he was able to complete a remarkable god given work i'd recommend it to anyone
<START> the book is so good that at least the opening of this made for tv movie will move you but then as it <UNK> more and more from the book taking out all the religion and love and <UNK> and putting in <UNK> candy cliches it becomes boring still from comments i've heard people who have not read the book tend to like it and if it leads even on child to read a <UNK> in time it will have served its purpose the most embarrassing change is to make the happy medium a clone of mary <UNK> uncle albert i love to laugh nothing is quite so <UNK> inducing as characters on the screen laughing hilariously at things that are totally unfunny
<START> <UNK> 3 is probably the <UNK> series that people have least heard of it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it but it is still great a fiery duke of <UNK> and a fat foolish dr johnson writer of the first <UNK> in england make this series one to be <UNK> with there are still more hilarious one liners to be delivered in this series and it brings out the humour in a lesser known era in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes <UNK> third outing is not the most famous and well known of the lot but <UNK> <UNK> role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one and hugh laurie is at his best in this series very good 9 10
<START> return of the jedi is certainly the most action packed of the series and is a fine conclusion to the star wars saga with han solo imprisoned by <UNK> the <UNK> and the empire building a new death star the rebel alliance is facing an <UNK> struggle against the dark side and only our favourite heroes can pull it off br br the opening sequence set on <UNK> we see <UNK> palace a pit of slavery and <UNK> and new home to han solo as luke and the gang prepare for his rescue and with <UNK> jedi powers they have the edge br br we also witness a tremendous triple battle at the end han leia and <UNK> battle it out on <UNK> desperate to <UNK> the <UNK> protecting the death star the rebel fleet led by <UNK> battle with the <UNK> fleet while they wait for the <UNK> to go down and luke has a final showdown with darth vader an epic end to a classic saga and it's only just of the pace of the first two br br 10 10
<START> when seeing this movie you should take notice to that it´s not a normal movie it has no real story just characters a bunch of gangster characters who come together in a perfect harmony the dialogue is wonderful you can just lay back and listen the movie stands out thats why it´s hard to find a right way of describing it br br thats why the user comments on this movie is so mixed br br i for one love the movie and recommend it to all who love one liners and things that <UNK> from the normal you <UNK> really put the finger on <UNK> so wonderful about it it´s just a comical world where gangsters rule a place of love and danger a movie that you can see more than one time
<START> this series produced at probably the most <UNK> time following the events of the second world war is on a scale of value that stands far above any <UNK> <UNK> to criticize br br the timing of world at <UNK> production in 1974 <UNK> to some three decades after the events of the war <UNK> an accurate relating of events in a manner <UNK> by <UNK> propaganda and <UNK> the passage of thirty years allows the telling to be backed up by an impressive and fascinating <UNK> of the very individuals involved ranging from some of the highest military and political figures down to the field soldiers civilians and such survivors of the death camps as have remained to bear witness to the <UNK> <UNK> of which <UNK> humans are capable most approaching or well into their senior years the interviewed subjects have had enough time to reflect on their experiences and in most instances have had enough time for whatever propaganda and <UNK> may have affected them in the past to have <UNK> away leaving only the memories of what they saw and what they did br br the information that these survivors give strikingly <UNK> by the <UNK> and expressions they display while telling their part give their stories all the more impact such names as ira <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> louis <UNK> albert <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hitler's personal secretary the list is far too long to relate br br today within the lifetime of the survivors of this enormous lesson in the hideous price of political ambition are young people who <UNK> the same sort of <UNK> and <UNK> war promotion as led to ww2 the dvd series we discuss here ought to <UNK> the core of a mandatory history subject in schools that the lessons bought at such a horrible cost in those days should not have been wasted but should be taken to heart by those who did not see <UNK> the terrible price br br i am almost done watching the 11 <UNK> set having seen most of the series when a local tv channel aired it more than 10 years ago it has lost none of its <UNK> to me indeed has become even more of a magnificent <UNK> of some of the very darkest days of human times br br the highest possible rating seems <UNK> of being applied to this presentation i think the value of this series is beyond counting
<START> now this is what a family movie should be there are few films of recent years that have been targeted at families or children that really are worthy of their viewing public but this is one of them my whole family came away from the film <UNK> entertained <UNK> and happy we're still <UNK> little <UNK> from it here and there the children loved it and so did we <UNK> and i are <UNK> and <UNK> respectively br br apart from its beautiful and striking animation the characters small as they may be and imaginary as they are are very well developed there isn't one of them that you cannot empathize with the personalities bringing these little creatures to life are well casted voice talents combined with the skill and artistry of some of disney's best animators this is a film worthy of walt disney himself i think mr disney would <UNK> <UNK> of this new film flick <UNK> and their fellow band of tiny heroes may become as popular as mickey and <UNK> in our time br br this is one the family leaves the theatre wanting to see again and buy to own on video or dvd i'm eager to see it again to pick up what i might have missed the first time never have i seen my children so quickly and vividly identify with and embrace characters before my daughter is still talking about little <UNK> br br this film is funny heartwarming clever and great fun for the whole family
<START> this film tried to be too many things all at once <UNK> political satire hollywood blockbuster sappy romantic comedy family values <UNK> the list goes on and on it failed miserably at all of them but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end br br although i appreciate the spirit behind war inc it <UNK> me to see such a clumsy effort especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique rather than simply the poor writing direction and production of this particular film br br there is a critique to be made about the <UNK> of war but <UNK> fun at it in this way <UNK> the true atrocity of what is happening reminds me a bit of three kings which similarly <UNK> a genuine cause for concern
<START> it's so sad that romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and <UNK> individuals who <UNK> this kind of cheap and <UNK> shows as superficial and brutal as the <UNK> series or the <UNK> <UNK> child plays the difference is that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and other such sub <UNK> never presume to claim their shows as art <UNK> who 40 years ago made a very good movie <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> followed by another one nice enough <UNK> tries to <UNK> his film <UNK> art works but unfortunately he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression as such <UNK> <UNK> offers again a <UNK> of how not this being about its only merit
<START> blank check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties the plot is completely pointless its overtones of <UNK> are pathetic do you really believe a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this film like buying a mansion for a mere 300 grand the notion let alone the bargain basement price will only be believed by the most <UNK> viewers please respect your intelligence and don't watch this awful awful film
<START> a solid if <UNK> film matthau as einstein was wonderful my favorite part and the only thing that would make me go out of my way to see this again was the wonderful scene with the <UNK> playing <UNK> i loved the <UNK> and the conversation while they waited for robbins to retrieve the <UNK>
<START> the opening scene of this film sets the pace for the entirety of its ninety minutes the shots are generic conventional and of television movie quality the snow <UNK> scenery is gorgeous yet the characters held with in it have a similar quality to that of looking at a photograph of such scenery the overwhelming feeling being that of distance some of the editing is fairly high quality and the work of an veteran professional the dialogue however is clunky and artificial having little bearing on <UNK> conversations at all seemingly any emotional insight is <UNK> in favour of swearing which is of course the way in which everyone shows their true feelings the action is slow and <UNK> the overall feeling being one of someone <UNK> cold water over your head but so slowly that you barely notice yet eventually you feel pathetic and slightly sorry for yourself for being caught in such a incomprehensible situation br br the mixture of genres that the <UNK> has seemingly tried to use psychological thriller horror and family drama although commendable suffers from a serious lack of tension and interesting dialogue the way in which the husband wife and child trio interact is particularly unrealistic the themes of family relationships being played out in haunting setting have been covered countless times before by far superior films an instant example being that of the shining 1980 the family unit here are torn by <UNK> troubles which are hard to understand or <UNK> with considering the relative ambiguity of the script br br the family unit is hardly stalked throughout the film <UNK> playing down the thriller possibilities of the narrative in favour of a slow family drama for the majority of the running time the <UNK> figure <UNK> has few apparent motives for his behaviour and despite being perhaps the most interesting and well acted character is still very underdeveloped the main characters are empty <UNK> of people who it was extremely hard to relate to their relationships with each other being particularly void of any sentiment or feeling although the ignorance of the <UNK> per <UNK> young character by his parents is presumably part of the story surely any reasonable person would question their son if he allegedly spoke to someone who seemingly doesn't exist people can accept this film as intelligent because of its relative lack of conventional aspects regarding creature based horror movies but this film fails in respect of <UNK> genre you wished to <UNK> it in you can read deep psychological meanings into every single minute detail of anything if you should so wish to but i think people would be better off over <UNK> their carpet for some deep emotional meaning rather than these vacuous sub human creations
<START> after harry <UNK> teenage girlfriend is raped by <UNK> <UNK> the night walker <UNK> becomes <UNK> and <UNK> himself by having sex with some lesbians meanwhile <UNK> who carries a <UNK> and dresses like a magician rapes some more women eventually <UNK> decides to track him down and end his crime spree despite being shot on film and <UNK> nasty it looks like any other 70's porno and is <UNK> executed the rape abuse scenes are surprisingly restrained and the attempt to cash in on death wish is laughable r <UNK> cannibal holocaust plays a cop <UNK> who is usually over the top <UNK> out in a couple of scenes but he's too well <UNK> for my money this <UNK> could have been much <UNK>
<START> although the beginning of the movie in new york takes too long the movie is a must see for people who like this genre when hannah goes to berlin to visit the older woman who helped her mother during the war the movie gets much much better the movie is a bit like the <UNK> can not really be compared
<START> this is a comedy based on national stereotypes no doubt if you leave away pretending you know or you care what communism was about and how real russians or brits are if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions you can have fun with this film nicole kidman is at her best sexy moving and funny ben chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out <UNK> by nicole and the rest of the cast does good work as well the final is moving and logical movie <UNK> of course worth watching if you accept the rules of the game
<START> this film is a true and historical film it is very useful to those <UNK> the lds church because it is 100 true it is an excellent film and i recommend it br br it is very factual exciting and <UNK> there are some who think it is not factual but it is br br it is about the <UNK> of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints and about the prophet joseph smith who restored it it has such events in his life as the disease that he had when he was a small boy his <UNK> emma smith emma his wife giving birth and so on but most importantly it reveals the <UNK> of the church
<START> here be spoilers br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is returning home from capital <UNK> to rural <UNK> to celebrate her fathers <UNK> birthday she is by far the youngest child and has two sisters <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has a family and still lives in <UNK> and <UNK> has divorced and moved a town away <UNK> is still single and is focused on her career there are a lot of jealousy and almost <UNK> between the sisters and conflicts <UNK> all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle as the party goes on and alcohol consumed more and more secrets become <UNK> and more and more conflicts <UNK> br br comments to be the work of a new writer director it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older swedish comedy dramas has been following for years there are really no new elements or ideas this movie draws upon three basic areas 1 embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves 2 sorrow and 3 anxiety this move has the focus on the last one almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along no loss though since the humor that is there is not funny the performances from the cast are good i guess though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten i had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences but there were none to conclude there are better ways to spend one's time than watching this br br 3 10
<START> this movie was extremely poorly conceived from every angle except technological i stood and watched everyone <UNK> out of the theater their faces <UNK> like their lives <UNK> before their eyes eyes wandering at their neighbor wondering if it was just them i mean how could the movie really be bad <UNK> admit it it's a classic case of the emperor wears no clothes who am i to question a movie containing a guy who stops a jet liner but the fact remains every member of the audience is thinking what i'm writing right now i actually <UNK> their faces br br obviously lois is only <UNK> by power she won't even have a cup of coffee with the superman with glasses who doesn't stop jet liners it can't be the look in his eyes to the depths of his soul or anything like that in the old <UNK> she had some level of connection with him he wasn't <UNK> number 1 obviously but it <UNK> her character that she was torn i bet henry <UNK> would have even won this lois over before clark kent br br and now it's official <UNK> does to superman what eating at <UNK> does to the <UNK> person br br superman one he loses his earth dad then finds his real super dad the story is captivating every step of the way he's human he relates to people and he feels love for people he relates to <UNK> students he relates to people who feel different he relates the superman returns superman seems to relate only to <UNK> and it seems he's just doing a job when he's saving people br br there's something about clark that lois likes she's really <UNK> in love with him but can't admit it and when he comes into the picture as superman it throws a <UNK> in the on the rocks love without superman she would've fallen in love with clark at least that's what the movie points to whether it was the intention or not superman returns is a love story between a woman and superman clark is like a pile of horse <UNK> to lois literally br br superman two i just watched it again as a kid i thought i enjoyed the action but now i know it was the story that held me then too watching it over and over again if i saw superman returns as a child i would've hated it then too i think br br there is so much heart and soul and <UNK> going around in this movie it's sick superman gives up his powers for love as a world plot is going on and meanwhile meanwhile lex <UNK> got something fantastic up his <UNK> br br superman three now there's a three way love story between superman and <UNK> and clark only humanity wins and <UNK> inner nature beats <UNK> power because when his <UNK> nature is gone and he's <UNK> who does human things with his <UNK> she sees it's not the power of superman that she's in love with it's not <UNK> but <UNK> that she loves and who's really super and when she tells clark she prefers him to superman he is <UNK> he has made a human connection again he wants to be accepted for who he is not just for his ability to bend steel this is the kind of stuff that's missing from superman returns br br clark super <UNK> to help the kid get a strike humanity again plus it's an <UNK> use of <UNK> he's not just using straight <UNK> strength br br he <UNK> the coal into a diamond for his woman because she had to sell hers love is the only thing that drives him to use his powers other than for saving br br it seems there's nothing at stake in superman returns even in superman three we see the <UNK> caused by the <UNK> world <UNK> plot we see suffering we see how it effects <UNK> and others and people in the middle of it there's no damage <UNK> emotional from <UNK> plot to sink the us we see a <UNK> of crystal thrown into space superman had to get very creative in the first three <UNK> in order to stop the plot against him he couldn't just access his <UNK> in the first one he had to stop two <UNK> going in different directions and then break his universal <UNK> and <UNK> history to save <UNK> life this was thirty years ago in the second one he had to <UNK> three guys that he was already more powerful than but combined with <UNK> genius and the <UNK> <UNK> tactics <UNK> <UNK> wasn't enough he had to work one against the other and <UNK> them in superman iii again his <UNK> weren't enough to win he had to <UNK> a computer that <UNK> everything it saw he couldn't use straight <UNK> on the computer because it <UNK> it in advance so he had to use a <UNK> acid that would only become deadly to the computer after the computer <UNK> to the <UNK> and he found that acid earlier when he couldn't simply use his <UNK> to blow out a fire because it was a chemical fire so he had to use his <UNK> he couldn't carry water so he <UNK> a lake and dropped it on the fire now in superman returns he simply <UNK> the island into <UNK> like a night <UNK> for ups he doesn't need to figure anything out he just uses his super strength and lex <UNK> brilliance was shown at the <UNK> level of a <UNK> who just ran out of junk br br to say nothing of the fact that he threw that island into <UNK> after getting stabbed with a knife of <UNK> right in the <UNK> and the island itself was dripping <UNK> <UNK> in his face but he just <UNK> his eyes and nose like it wasn't grey <UNK> he was looking at
<START> the movie aimed at adults is a rare thing these days but moonstruck does it well and is still a better than average movie which is aging very well although it's comic moments aim lower than the rest of it the movie has a wonderful <UNK> italians in brooklyn that isn't used to <UNK> the characters or the viewers i e <UNK> never appear in <UNK> it never becomes grotesque like my big fat greek wedding the secondary story lines are <UNK> told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread these are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and <UNK> i miss these scenes it also beautifully involves older characters the movie takes it's own slight quiet path to a conclusion there isn't a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives <UNK> relax cage and cher do very nice work br br moonstruck <UNK> old school ethnic <UNK> new york much like <UNK> except moonstruck is way less <UNK>
<START> just after i saw the movie the true magic feeling of the walt disney movies came up in me and i realized me that it was a long time ago that i saw the <UNK> magic in a movie br br the combination of the right music speeches and magical effects brings the disney feeling again into your body very special things i saw where the not knowing effects in the movie started with the disney <UNK> <UNK> into the cinderella castle and ended as an old story telling fairytale with your grandparents br br the magic has returned in me i rate this movie 8 out of 10
<START> everyone involved with this project should be ashamed as to the result of their efforts oh i laughed a <UNK> of times but i laughed a couple of times during <UNK> list also they really screwed up a good premise
<START> a film starring <UNK> <UNK> and colin farrell two respected and talented actors sounds like a great idea an independent film sounds even better the studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more creativity br br but then why is this movie so bland ask the dust br br this film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters no one is given a proper back story so we don't ever know why the characters act the way they do br br explanations for physical and emotional <UNK> are left to our imagination if you still have one left at the end of this movie br br i told a friend that i went to see this film and that i thought it was awful br br her question not even colin farrell could save it my response not even colin <UNK> ass could save it
<START> things get dull early an often in this in this <UNK> jazz bio fiction written and directed by spike lee br br <UNK> gilliam <UNK> washington is a <UNK> jazz <UNK> that <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> them in at below the underdog his problems include an incompetent manager a stage <UNK> <UNK> player and two girlfriends that he's playing musical <UNK> with the real love of his life though is his <UNK> and his music the <UNK> manager giant has a dangerous gambling problem and proves to be an <UNK> <UNK> with greedy club owners and would be best <UNK> but <UNK> remains loyal for as long as possible it will prove to his <UNK> as an artist but ironically contribute to his growth as a man br br as <UNK> <UNK> washington is all wrong as the ambitious <UNK> with a babe on each arm he's too sweet a guy to be so self centered about his art <UNK> patience and love to those close to him with a low key <UNK> he simply lacks the fire wesley snipes who plays henderson the <UNK> player would have been far more suited for the role but even he would have to mouth the <UNK> throw away <UNK> of lee's <UNK> dialogue as giant lee hits the <UNK> with an abysmal performance to match his writing and direction loosely attempting to mirror the <UNK> but sympathetic ratso rizzo to <UNK> joe buck he <UNK> a limp and even the i'm <UNK> here moment from midnight cowboy in this case you wish the taxi would run him over and be done with it br br lee's script is all tepid argument heavy handed <UNK> and <UNK> insult with some requisite clumsy <UNK> that lee has to <UNK> to remain down the scenes between the band members <UNK> and in rehearsal lack spark and are only <UNK> in <UNK> by the <UNK> giant conversations that have an ad <UNK> look and go in circles <UNK> this travesty is lee's pretentious visual style tracking shots <UNK> and pans are wasted and without significance to scenes they just wander br br blues is lee's love letter to jazz made <UNK> by the mountains of <UNK> <UNK> all over the sets and it's all sentimental <UNK> trap that lacks passion and <UNK> jazz on film is better served by <UNK> round midnight and eastwood's bird which get below the surface reveal more sides of the form the pain behind it in addition to offering infinitely superior lead performances by forrest <UNK> and the real deal <UNK> gordon this spike lee joint doesn't even offer a mild buzz it's some pretty bad <UNK>
<START> take one look at the cover of this movie and you know right away that you are not about to watch a landmark film this is cheese filmmaking in every respect but it does have its moments despite the look of utter trash that the movie gives the story is actually interesting at some points although it is undeniably pulled along mainly by the <UNK> <UNK> shower scenes and sex scenes with numerous personality free boyfriends the acting is awful and the director did little more than point and shoot which is why the extensive amount of nudity was needed to keep the audience's attention br br in the nutty professor a hopelessly geeky professor discovers a <UNK> that can turn him into a cool and stylish <UNK> whereas in the invisible maniac a mentally damaged professor discovers a <UNK> that can make him invisible allowing him to spy on and kill for some reason his students boring fodder don't expect any kind of mental <UNK> from this and prepare yourself for shrill and enormously overdone <UNK> laughter which gets real annoying real quick
<START> this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen br br i have to disagree with another <UNK> who said the special effects were okay i found them pretty bad it just wasn't realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story br br maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story the <UNK> are looking for the set they do not bother to tell what set or what is so special about it that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt br br if you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert take the effort to actually go to the desert the beginning the ancient ceremony looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert br br the action level was constant throughout the movie no ups and downs no climax it made the movie look short and that's certainly a pro for this particular movie
<START> once you can get past the film's title pecker is a great film perhaps one of john <UNK> best a wonderful cast headed by strong performances by edward <UNK> and christina <UNK> make the story very funny and very real there are some shocking scenes that are definitely not suitable for young children but they are there for a purpose unfortunately this movie was not mass produced and most of the public will be denied the opportunity to view it if the opportunity knocks then go see this film
<START> please spare me of these movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified couple that with a vacuous script with an intense desire to be a <UNK> or a <UNK> brother plus the lives of yet another group of supposedly high school age people acting out their dawson creek brand teen angst complete with a <UNK> soundtrack that woefully tries to make the movie feel cool and we have intensely and painfully inept satire br br this isn't even watered down <UNK> <UNK> i'd rather watch a traffic light change br br only one scene stands out as anywhere near worth the price of admission when the betty masked girls meet a richard <UNK> masked friend it's a surreal moment priceless even br br but for the rest of it i'd rather have a <UNK> at least i can apply some <UNK> <UNK> to stop the pain
<START> after dark my sweet is a great modern noir filled with seedy characters dirt roads and of course <UNK> characters it seems that most of the truly great <UNK> of the last two or three decades have taken place in the south where the men <UNK> and the ladies um <UNK> too why because it's <UNK> and because everyone looks better wet at least the men do <UNK> women leave me <UNK> br br anyway there might be some spoilers in here br br this film is a wonderful example of everything a noir should be steady pacing though some with attention <UNK> refer to it as <UNK> clearly and <UNK> drawn though not simple characters and tons of atmosphere noir if anything is about <UNK> and attitudes that's why the great ones are not marked by your traditional <UNK> of <UNK> acting look at bogart mitchum hurt and nicholson they and their characters were anything but real but they had style and <UNK> and in a crime movie that's exactly what you want or quickly paced adventures again all great <UNK> seem to be on slow burn like a cigarette great <UNK> create an environment and you just inhabit it with the characters for a couple hours br br after dark my sweet let's you do that and it let's you enjoy the company of some very interesting and complex characters uncle bud and <UNK> are intriguing never allowing the audience to know what really makes them <UNK> and <UNK> and dern i love bruce dern by the way are pitch perfect dern especially see previous comment they take the basic <UNK> of a character and give them depth and <UNK> our <UNK> br br the story itself is also interesting <UNK> better plots in the world of noir hardly any mystery here mostly it's suspense but this one is solid if anything the simply <UNK> plot has more to do with jim <UNK> writing than anything else with thompson plots are almost secondary he <UNK> the <UNK> tales of <UNK> and chandler for simpler stories with stronger more confusing characters look at a novel like the killer inside me and and you'll see right away from the title what it's all about when it comes to thompson it's not what it's about it's how it's about it to quote roger ebert so really the relatively simple plot of a kidnapping is not the point and if you don't like it well the jokes on you br br why this is an <UNK> movie rather than a <UNK> one is because of the female lead she's not bad per se but she's not <UNK> huston or <UNK> <UNK> see the adaptation of jim <UNK> the <UNK> if you don't know what i'm talking about besides it's a better movie and you should start there for contemporary noir it's the best of the 1990s and challenges blood simple for the title of best since <UNK> she simply doesn't have the chops or the looks for that matter and though she and <UNK> have some chemistry i don't have it with her so there
<START> i recently bought this movie with a bunch of other <UNK> from ebay usually i am into war and action movies but occasionally i enjoy romantic comedies br br if you are bored by today's special fx films and high <UNK> romantic comedies you should check out shop around the corner on a quiet evening what i like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency there is nothing fake or pretentious about them take mr <UNK> for example when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself not just because of the <UNK> but because he has been <UNK> to the character of stewart ok <UNK> example br br yes the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable yet still i liked it a lot if you likes <UNK> hill then you will like shop around the corner in fact hugh grant reminds me a lot of jimmy stewart
<START> this movie is so bad it's good in an unintentionally funny way i couldn't stop watching it i was laughing so much it's like a parody of a romantic thriller except it's not a parody br br alexandra paul plays emily <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> wife who falls hard for luke corey <UNK> a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison the only thing <UNK> is guilty of though is bad acting mind you he's no worse than the other actors you get the sense that the actors have no idea they're in a really awful film they're playing it straight everything about the film is bad the acting the script the love scenes the pacing the plot twists the choice of music the climactic scenes are just so ludicrous first the shootout in the church then <UNK> final words to emily i was howling with laughter br br evidently luke did a lot of weight <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in prison and we get to see plenty of his naked <UNK> that's probably the highlight of the film
<START> in 1987 john hughes wrote and directed <UNK> trains and <UNK> which was a hilarious and poignant comedy  the best thing he's ever done ten years on he's reduced to again <UNK> the plot of <UNK> <UNK> in this second sequel which is not connected to the other films but is equally uninspired and sadistic the four crooks  that's right four and one of them is a girl <UNK> hughes for introducing this revolutionary change to the series  are <UNK> with metal <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> and <UNK> with paint ha ha ha <UNK> ha while the new kid is even less charming than culkin you'd think that the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would stop hughes from <UNK> the same old routines but the only surprise is that not even he turned up for <UNK> alone <UNK>
<START> sleeping with the enemy is a predictable <UNK> there <UNK> thriller that never seems to find any inspiration no matter how desperately cast and crew try i can't believe a bunch of my friends talked me into seeing this at the movies some sixteen years ago br br the complete lack of originality from the ronald bass screenplay based upon the nancy price novel does not help nor does the stale direction of joseph <UNK> or the very average performance from julia roberts the supporting cast including patrick <UNK> and kevin anderson do little to help br br there really isn't a lot to say just give it a miss br br sunday april 14 1991 <UNK> cinema centre melbourne
<START> it's funny i've seen a bunch of fassbinder films and i have found some to be extremely creative and interesting while others are <UNK> and self indulgent <UNK> like this film for me it <UNK> from great to crap without much in the middle i know he has a lot of fans among the sophisticated but i can't help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype from my point of view and i know i will get a lot of negative ratings for this he made too many movies too quickly and was too self indulgent his gay or gender <UNK> films like this one tend to be really bad <UNK> done sometimes quite boring such as <UNK> and the bitter tears of <UNK> von <UNK> and sometimes just gross like this film couldn't his message about acceptance of a person's gender confusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching <UNK> being <UNK> slaughtered show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympathetic then maybe i'd care about the films br br i'm honestly at the point after watching this film that i might not bother with any more fassbinder films the bad seems to be out <UNK> the good
<START> the first collaboration between <UNK> cooper is a compelling documentary on the <UNK> of the <UNK> tribe of <UNK> twice a year more than 50 000 people and half a million animals cross rivers and mountains to get to <UNK> you'll feel like a <UNK> <UNK> after watching these people herd their animals through ice cold water and walk <UNK> through the snow to cross the mountains while trying to get their animals to walk along <UNK> and narrow mountain paths
<START> raymond <UNK> stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend dick <UNK> thanks to his affection for his friend's wife angela lansbury this was a full year before he started doing perry mason so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting br br there isn't all that much else here that's interesting though lansbury is always good but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious there's an interesting performance by <UNK> johnson as a painter who's also in love with the femme fatale but the <UNK> character is pretty straightforward it's frankly bizarre to see an actor like <UNK> doing these romantic scenes with lansbury and his <UNK> delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films i've seen him in there's no mystery at all really and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that <UNK> character is setting up the lansbury character to <UNK> herself double <UNK> <UNK> her being tried again for the original murder presumably he does so with a very large tape <UNK> which she doesn't notice when she comes into the room i guess br br a few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for tv
<START> american film makers decided to make a film they think is japanese the characters all badly represented the actors are not even japanese and the set is cheap unreal and definitely doesn't represent <UNK> in early <UNK> and <UNK> who ever read the book understand that the script writers didn't add any extra value to <UNK> the movie from the script worse they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs rob marshall is using for his two main characters two well known chinese actors who joined before in <UNK> tiger hidden dragon marshall probably saw one chinese movie and tho they represent japanese culture seeing those two actors together again even makes the movies more ridiculous <UNK> <UNK> last scene in kill bill 1 is ten times more japanese made than that of this movie
<START> good show very entertaining good <UNK> arts acting good story plot the entire main crew did a nice job from robert <UNK> to chuck norris jennifer <UNK> and especially a big hand to <UNK> mills an especially fine tribute to robert <UNK> in his latter days a great actor who will be truly missed
<START> didn't care for the movie the book was better does anyone know where it was filmed this was my first visit to your site just found the answer to my question so now i look like a <UNK> but i think i'll still submit my comments and yes british columbia is lovely or why they took it from its south <UNK> <UNK> setting this question stands the place was essential to the fabric of the book and its change was part of my disappointment with the movie oh i just read where i need to write at least ten lines here's my other main issue with the film kim <UNK> was too vapid and not at all what i <UNK> from the book i know the book was the book and the movie well not so good i found the character in the book much more <UNK> also the book <UNK> <UNK> almost primitive images of the monastery while the castle in the film was much more visually impressive it distorted the feel of the story and seemed at odds with the characters
<START> weak plot predictable violence only semi interesting characters like the writer also one of the stars was <UNK> his own screw ups and added an <UNK> fantasies of drugs and murder to make it hot from the predictable rap and house soundtrack to the family conflicts it's poorly acted stereotypical and ultimately terribly boring even the title has been done before imdb lists five movies with the same name released in 2007 2008 br br note saw it on showtime which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies was halfway thru before i realized no one was an undercover cop even tho another stereotype would have made it interesting if it happened
<START> i found this film to be quite an <UNK> from the very get go i found it extremely hard to like this movie and now after a little thinking about it i can pretty much <UNK> the reason why jean marc <UNK> although i love him to bits i think <UNK> is one of the best movies ever made is quite miscast here and although i can't figure for the life of me who would be better i am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work everything else is fine except for the stabs at weak comedy a meet the parents joke is not really needed filmmakers and i really like richard e grant as the british major it just suffers from one thing jean marc
<START> one out of ten stars br br because if it was it gets an f holy mother mary of god was this bad i mean i gave it every reasonable <UNK> considering it was a straight to video film but it let me down at every turn like so many other b movies the basic storyline was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources but the execution was ridiculous it's a shame they attached the good name of halloween to this fiasco br br the basic premise <UNK> some frat <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> halloween haunted house <UNK> <UNK> when a satanic spell book shows up out of nowhere and <UNK> the frat boys into a living hell well that's the idea anyway but instead most of the film is devoted to displaying these frat boy's relationship <UNK> abound with an outrageous lesbian subplot very little of the actual story is devoted to halloween or the mysterious spell book it actually makes me mad that the film makers thought they could get away with making such <UNK> br br the film is essentially about frat boy relationships this is not what the movie is billed as i'm tempted to track down the producers and at the very least <UNK> them with <UNK> harm the acting is about as bad as it gets it's atrocious the script is unintentionally funny the cinematography is just plain lazy the whole film is amateur night this movie actually makes the <UNK> channel movie productions look like masterpieces br br the last half hour of the film felt like the film makers realized they weren't producing a soap opera and had to throw in some sort of horror sequences the evil spell book finally comes into play and turns everyone in the haunted house into the character their dressed up as i almost feel like crying as i write this review wow i mean wow this thing was an <UNK> chopped up disaster
<START> spoilers all too in real life as well as in the movies familiar story that happens to many young men who are put in a war zone with a gun or rifle in their hands the case of young and innocent in never handling or firing a gun jimmy davis <UNK> tone has been repeated thousands of times over the centuries when men like jimmy davis are forced to take up arms for their country br br jimmy who at first wanted to be kicked out of the us army but was encouraged to stay by being <UNK> in the mouth by his good friend fred p willis spencer tracy ended up on the front lines in france with <UNK> unit <UNK> down by a german machine gun nest he single <UNK> put it out of <UNK> picking off some half dozen german soldiers from the safety of a nearby church <UNK> it was when jimmy <UNK> down the last surviving german who raised his arms in surrender that an <UNK> shell hit the <UNK> seriously <UNK> him br br recovering from his wounds at an army hospital jimmy fell in love with us army <UNK> nurse rose <UNK> <UNK> george rose was really in love with <UNK> good friend the happy go lucky fred despite his obnoxious antics towards her it's when fred was lost during the fighting on the western front that rose thinking that he was killed fell in love and later married jimmy when fred unexpectedly showed up in the french town where jimmy now fully <UNK> from his wounds was <UNK> at things got very <UNK> for both him and rose who had already accepted <UNK> <UNK> of marriage to her br br with wwi over and jimmy marrying rose left fred who's still in love with her a bitter and <UNK> young man it was almost by accident that fred ran into jimmy on the streets of new york city and discovered to his shock and surprise that he completely changed from the meek and non violent person that he knew before he was sent to war on the european western front smug and sure of himself and his ability to shoot a gun jimmy had become a top mobster in new york city's underworld not only that but as fred later found out his wife rose had no idea what jimmy was really involved in with jimmy telling her that he works as a law <UNK> and <UNK> insurance <UNK> br br <UNK> life of crime came full circle when rose after she found out about his secret life <UNK> him out to the police to prevent him from <UNK> a valentine day like massacre with his gang members dressed as cops of his rival <UNK> while on trial jimmy came to his senses and admitted his guilt willing to face the music and then after his three year sentence is up get his life back together br br spoiler alert hearing rumors from fellow <UNK> that rose and his best friend fred were having an affair behind his back jimmy broke out of prison ending up a fugitive from the law it's at <UNK> circus where he works as both <UNK> and barker that jimmy in seeing that rose as well as fred were true to him that he like at his trial had a sudden change of heart but the thought of going back to prison with at least another ten years added on to his sentence was just too much for jimmy it was then that jimmy decided to end it all by letting the police who by then <UNK> him down do the job that he himself didn't have the heart to do for him
<START> this movie is similar to darkness falls and the boogeyman 2005 but it's also much more graphic than both and not as good as either it's also slow and fairly predictable it's also got shades of deliverance and the <UNK> horror plus we get some new age <UNK> thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a <UNK> inspirational <UNK> really this movie is a <UNK> of almost everything even though it is gory the makeup effects are not very realistic looking in fact they look kinda cheap aside from all that there is some really awful clichéd dialogue and i won't say when but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or believable given the circumstances nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way once you watch the movie you'll know what i mean there's also some gratuitous nudity for <UNK> sake it just wasn't necessary at all the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good better than this movie deserves so after carefully <UNK> the evidence id say this movie was passable but not good my verdict for the tooth fairy 4 10
<START> i can understand why some people like this movie and why some people don't for me though i really like it even if i noticed some good bits and not so impressive bits the animation was actually excellent like charlie's dream the characters were a mixed bag the best being anne marie voiced by the late <UNK> <UNK> i was physically ill when i read what happened to her also carface is a very convincing villain especially voiced by the wonderful <UNK> <UNK> i particularly loved morons i'm surrounded by morons and along with <UNK> and warren t rat is probably the most memorable of all the don <UNK> villains charlie and itchy only just lacked the same <UNK> but i loved king <UNK> and his song some of the film is very haunting like <UNK> you can never come come back which kind of scares me still unfortunately there were some bits i didn't like so much the story had a tendency to become clumsy and <UNK> but disney's black <UNK> suffered from the same problem also there were some dark scenes that young children would find <UNK> but the ending is very poignant however the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung none of them in particular stick out with exception of let's make music together and love survives and burt reynolds can't sing and dom <UNK> has done much better singing all in all a watchable movie that could have been more but is definitely memorable and i would definitely watch it again 7 10 <UNK> cox
<START> ronald colman gives an <UNK> performance as tony john a broadway actor who can't separate his <UNK> life from shakespeare's othello the character he plays on stage two important scenes illustrate tony's dilemma the first one takes place in producer max <UNK> office acting is a matter of talent for the practical minded <UNK> but <UNK> tony's friend <UNK> no no when you do it like tony does it it's much more the way he has of becoming someone else every night so completely no don't tell me his whole system isn't affected by it the other scene occurs in waitress pat <UNK> apartment tony tells her his name is martin she thanks him then he says or paul hamlet joe and maybe othello when tony begins <UNK> othello we learn that though he's trying to keep his real life separated from his stage life the part begins to <UNK> into your life and the battle begins reality against imagination he can't keep the two separated in his mind pat is <UNK> and he's othello and he wrongly believes she has been <UNK> to him he murders her <UNK> <UNK> performance in a complex and difficult role earned him <UNK> academy award for best actor oscar nominations went to ruth gordon and <UNK> <UNK> for best original screenplay not to be overlooked is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cinematography
<START> i have to say i hated this movie i don't like to say that because gerard butler is in it about a half an hour of boring conversation sorry to all who actually care about the plot i started fast <UNK> to <UNK> scenes i really don't know the ending i was that bored with it if <UNK> wasn't in it i probably either done one of two things fell asleep or turned it off but <UNK> is the bright light of this movie as he is with most of his earlier movies if you're a fan of <UNK> don't worry he's as adorable and precious as he always is but if you actually want to watch the movie for the plot good luck because you'll need it either that or lots of coffee or <UNK> to keep you awake br br 4 10 and that's just because the casting director had the sense to put <UNK> in this movie even though they had no idea of how to spell his name
<START> when braveheart first came out i was enthralled and was admittedly one of the most <UNK> fans of the film when rob roy came out i was intrigued and although i enjoyed the film i did not think it was a great film however as time has gone by my appreciation for rob roy has grown and my enthusiasm for braveheart has <UNK> braveheart is great entertainment to be sure but there are flaws as well the most significant in my view is the <UNK> portrayal of robert the bruce who was without a doubt <UNK> greatest king another is the historical <UNK> of the film which <UNK> the film in <UNK> to the many historical <UNK> i think i am also bothered by the fact that it was in this film seen only at least by me in retrospect that the <UNK> of mel <UNK> <UNK> can be seen clearly for the first time in contrast rob roy has grown on me over the years partly because it largely avoids the faults i mind most in braveheart but also because rob roy is like fine wine growing more mature and complex with each viewing
<START> this was not enjoyable to watch frank puts all his dreams on the back <UNK> and gets a normal boring job just so his <UNK> can go to film school but his <UNK> decides that he'll make a <UNK> documentary about the man instead a documentary filmmaker should point the camera and simply shoot not manipulate and comment with <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> of the filmmaker towards his <UNK> is obvious and sad the goal seems to be to make frank appear dumb and pathetic instead he comes across as the most human of the 3 people featured br br essentially a <UNK> campaign all dressed up as something much smarter and <UNK> than it really is it left me with an intense dislike for the filmmaker
<START> this film's premise is so simple and obvious that only a texas millionaire high on oil <UNK> and <UNK> would have a problem understanding it if someone <UNK> it across the proverbial parking lot in summary the oil business is in <UNK> with the government or <UNK> if you prefer the <UNK> is in <UNK> with middle eastern <UNK> and the cia is a <UNK> <UNK> pool of double dealing sons of insert word willing to toe any line that comes their way the only people that get done over are the good ones like mr clooney bob oh and terrorism is a result of the poverty which <UNK> creates when wicked <UNK> stalk the world looking for a tasty <UNK> or three that really fits to the <UNK> of the well <UNK> 9 11 <UNK> br br in <UNK> this <UNK> <UNK> of political half truths and hollywood <UNK> is <UNK> up in a <UNK> <UNK> of story <UNK> that twist turn and <UNK> through the <UNK> <UNK> of their own <UNK> until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that br br 1 the director good joke should never be let near a camera again br br 2 people like clooney and hurt might know how to act but they sure don't know how to pick a script br br 3 if you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big business and the state go and see claude <UNK> <UNK> du <UNK> which is insightful funny and brilliantly acted br br empty doom laden <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out to evening ruining length
<START> okay i'll admit the casting in the film is really strange part of this is due to the plot but i still had a bit of trouble believing pierce brosnan playing this lead though he really did a pretty good job br br it's based on a true story of an <UNK> who went to live with the canadian indians in the early 20th century he claimed to be a mixed blood indian he was in fact so successful and well thought of that people came from all over to hear his <UNK> and be taken on his wilderness <UNK> even though he was not a mixed blood indian and all his knowledge was from books or <UNK> the movie centers on this and what occurred when the <UNK> was <UNK> br br the acting and settings were great and i really liked the film once i suspended disbelief about brosnan it didn't get <UNK> distribution probably because it was pretty cerebral not a bond film nor a romance just a really odd film about a remarkable man
<START> one of the best if not the best stephen king's <UNK> dark as dark can be surprising non hollywood ending terrifying atmosphere amazing book adaptation outstanding cast educational don't play with <UNK> in short everything an excellent horror should be br br my favorite horror movie straight 10
<START> well done ghost story that will give you the creeps and some pretty fair scares along the way the story unfolds slowly building atmosphere all the way until you're ready to see the woman in black you won't forget her once you've seen her no gore no knives no hockey masks just a well constructed story that is best viewed at night with the lights out
<START> wow what can i say first off imdb says this is in the late 60s which means carlito would be very close to going to prison he got out in 75 and said he was in for 5 years they used a bunch of nobody actors and a story that didn't even make sense they bring back only one actor <UNK> and hes playing a totally different guy why did it end with him and this puerto <UNK> chick <UNK> <UNK> he said he was in love with her before <UNK> <UNK> he said he knew him forever you'd think he'd have been in this one and if this made sense where are <UNK> and the black dude in the first one it was all just stupid this is an insult to pacino and the first film
<START> i read the back of the box and it talked about mary shelley and <UNK> shelley and lord byron i thought wonderful this will be great i was so wrong the story was all screwed up in fact i still don't get it it just seems to me that all the characters did was drink smoke <UNK> and have sex not that those aren't good movie qualities but please where was the story i made myself finish the movie and yes it did pick up towards the end but by then the movie was almost over rent it if you really want to just don't trust the back of the box
<START> from the stupid quaint african natives <UNK> footage with our badly <UNK> principals acting as <UNK> to the horrible fake ears which <UNK> <UNK> indian elephants into african elephants to the utter lack of any logic at all to maureen <UNK> <UNK> whining of tarzan tarzan there is nothing about this movie which deserves classic status br br 4 10
<START> an excellent interpretation of jim <UNK> novel this neo noir thriller has all the requisite elements deranged ex boxer turned drifter alcoholic widow with sinister desires ex cop turned small time crook and a kidnap plot destined for doom yet the film never crosses into cliche country but remains fresh and intriguing the performances are all superb particularly bruce <UNK> role as the wicked <UNK> uncle bud there is a tense <UNK> to the film's movement which intentional or not adds to the grim proceedings highly recommended
<START> this film is a travesty no wait an abomination no wait this is without a doubt the absolute worst film ever made featuring beloved characters created and established by other actors br br i thought inspector <UNK> with alan arkin instead of peter sellers was ludicrous and <UNK> but even daring to remake stan laurel and oliver hardy is <UNK> and money <UNK> br br mr laurel and mr hardy have been dead respectively since 1957 and 1965 why anyone would even begin to imagine that suitable <UNK> for l h would be in the persona of bronson <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is beyond me i tuned in fully expecting to be horrified and embarrassed and i certainly wasn't disappointed everyone involved in this pathetic moronic disgrace should be <UNK> from anything and everything associated with hollywood and film making avoid this movie at all costs you have been <UNK> warned
<START> this is a <UNK> look at <UNK> life back when he still a hyper 20 something the real home videos of al as a kid are great and the commentary from his real life parents gives a nice glimpse of just how weird al wound up as screwed up as he is this video is a must own for any devoted al <UNK>
<START> this is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies once again it doesn't make since the killer still kills for fun but this time he is killing people that are making a movie about what happened in the first movie which means that it is the stupidest movie ever br br don't watch this if you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it you'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror action and crime br br don't let your children watch this teenager young child or young adult this movie has that sorta impact upon people
<START> <UNK> <UNK> spoken drama from steven spielberg was his first real venture into this genre a departure from his normal adventure fantasy fare it <UNK> the way for his 1993 success <UNK> list br br based upon alice <UNK> <UNK> prize winning novel the story concerns a young girl's arranged marriage of <UNK> to a brutal angry farmer and her painful <UNK> from her beloved younger sister <UNK> while the plot about compassion abuse and the power of love to <UNK> all wounds is often powerful and moving it loses its way through the fault of continuity and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> screenplay the color purple is at times hard to follow and on one or more occasions tends to be a little <UNK> in regard to time frame this <UNK> in scripting has cost the viewer the depth and detail obviously present in miss <UNK> novel a real shame that <UNK> spielberg was unable to pick out and <UNK> these problems as most of the show is a wonderful example of his <UNK> as a director br br performances are strong throughout with whoopi goldberg making a debut which she's never matched since with regard to acting accomplishment as the heart broken <UNK> who just <UNK> to be loved danny glover lends solid support though his <UNK> was a superior turn for him in places in the heart the standout showing comes from the <UNK> oprah <UNK> as miss sophia the single minded fighting black woman whose spirit is crushed by a terrible incident involving a <UNK> upper class white woman good support also from margaret <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> dawn chong br br <UNK> jones co producer with spielberg kathleen kennedy and frank marshall has penned a beautifully <UNK> score and also provided some original blues for the occasion editing from michael <UNK> is sound as always while director of photography allen <UNK> shows <UNK> skill in capturing some glorious southern scenery br br this true affair of the heart will surely bring a tear to your eye it is just unfortunate we are left with so many unanswered questions br br <UNK> january 15 1997 video
<START> actor herman <UNK> plays the role of a football of a soccer <UNK> that <UNK> the pass of two african players and tries to sell them for very little money to the rival club of the <UNK> club of its heart <UNK> <UNK> therefore these players did not play well and it wanted that the <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> with this but what happens is that these two players after all are good and <UNK> <UNK> sell them for much money to a foreign club making a good business the film for a small country as <UNK> without great <UNK> in great films is a very good and funny comedy showing all the rivalry that exists between north south of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> highly recommended
<START> if i hadn't been forced to watch this for work reasons i never would have made it past the first 10 minutes and even then i admit i fast <UNK> through parts the <UNK> film version was vastly superior in all regards yes i've read this one is more faithful to the original play but what a wise thing it was for the writer to change the script in <UNK> it's overlong it drags the songs that are in this version and not in the film version are boring and unimaginative the version of kids in the <UNK> version was very funny and a true classic of sarcastic parent humor in this version the kim is way too old the conrad is absolutely horrible to behold when someone ripped his shirt off him i <UNK> in disgust the director of this version has no idea what sexy is this conrad can't dance can't sing he can't even stay in tune and is simply repulsive if elvis <UNK> had really been like that his career would have been over before it began as for the other actors well i kept waiting for <UNK> <UNK> to fall off as he <UNK> and <UNK> was totally over acting as <UNK> see <UNK> performance in the film version to see the same role properly executed by someone who understands comic timing this tv version is nothing but a total waste of anyone's time
<START> the odd couple is a comic gem one the funniest script ever committed to celluloid <UNK> only by <UNK> spinal tap and <UNK> lemmon and matthau are best friends obsessive <UNK> felix and sloppy irresponsible oscar <UNK> wife has already left him because he is impossible to live with due to his irresponsible attitude <UNK> wife leaves him at the start of the movie and after an <UNK> suicide attempt he moves in with poker buddy oscar thats when the fun begins br br the entire script is brilliant and filled with brilliant one liners you are probably already familiar with the f u joke but it still works brilliantly due to <UNK> comic timing br br my favorite moments are when lemmon tries to clear his <UNK> in the diner and when the <UNK> sisters are being <UNK> by a very suave matthau and lemmon is totally out of his element this one requires repeat viewings
<START> <UNK> <UNK> has been very public in her <UNK> about this film calling it among other things anti feminist she has also said on her radio show she hates making romantic comedies because she doesn't believe in them i <UNK> agree with <UNK> here this film is a <UNK> at best she does her best but overall it was just another boring unbelievable romantic comedy that has no basis in the real world whereas there will be some who will say suspend your disbelief one grows tired of having to suspend it nearly every time you get a romantic film from hollywood <UNK> character for some reason is usually filmed in shadows and darkness which makes her look unattractive while <UNK> character is filmed in lighter tones which probably <UNK> <UNK> and is probably one of the reasons she <UNK> this film that really hurts the film if we are to buy the premise that <UNK> is supposed to be the better looking of the two as many have said here and on other comment threads <UNK> is not ugly but in fact quite beautiful i haven't read one review where someone said uma was better looking having said that though i believe that ben <UNK> character would more than likely stay with uma not <UNK> many men don't like really intelligent women and many women don't like really intelligent men and sadly ben probably would have stayed with uma and despite the director's attempt to make <UNK> unattractive it doesn't work her natural beauty comes through anyway br br i think a lot of <UNK> male fans who are obsessed with her like this film because they like to think of themselves in the ben chaplin character and actually <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> is a lot more complicated than the character she plays here real life is always much more complex than hollywood can imagine so take a cold shower gentlemen this is the role that <UNK> is best known for and that's a shame as this really isn't that good of a film
<START> this is just one more example of the absolute genius of gene wilder he wrote and starred in this terrific mystery no one could have done it better the suspense was <UNK> throughout i wish mr wilder would grace us with another of these i have enjoyed everything i have ever seen mr wilder in but i had no idea how truly talented he was until i saw murder in a small town and this follow on he truly has a firm grasp on what audiences want and how to deliver it in his writing and of course in his brilliant acting his subtle wit comes through in <UNK> i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes mysteries and or gene <UNK> film work his star just gets <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> well it turned out as i expected visual <UNK> but nothing else added to the original what did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick initially this <UNK> my interest but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns a were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical hollywood like product and b made the whole storyline improbable the 1968 story was <UNK> straightforward and included no time <UNK> or any bogus of that sort it just stated that when you come home after a long journey things might have changed a bit earth might have fallen in the hands of apes for example like many <UNK> movies it's main <UNK> was suspense hell does anyone understand that word these days in this burton movie an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie but at what cost surely the images are overwhelming and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete ape culture even ape music but what's wrong br br first the suspension of disbelief is made very hard because the apes have a lot of hollywood human traits i refer especially to <UNK> and the slave <UNK> these traits include emotional skills like irony sarcasm and an overtly displayed array of <UNK> emotions it makes you forget that the apes are apes which is essential br br second the humans talk of course we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans didn't made the ape human role switching very <UNK> and <UNK> in the 1968 version the wound in the throat that charlton heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later <UNK> speech essential to his <UNK> and the interest that dr <UNK> has in him so no need for things like human rights <UNK> or ape human love in order to explain things br br third the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the <UNK> but is a necessary twist in the new movie since capt <UNK> has to play the hollywood let's save the whole world and have a good ending for everyone and still make it to the <UNK> bar for a cool <UNK> coke character oh my god will they never learn i new it from the start when there was only one guy who got lost they were in need of a hero and then the script writers go on reasoning we need one guy so why would one guy get lost because he tries to save an ape from an <UNK> storm implausible but it's necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes since in these modern and politically correct times we can't have a <UNK> ape <UNK> like charlton <UNK> <UNK> character loose on the screen let's give them a <UNK> version br br fourth okay the general twist of the original <UNK> the <UNK> of the 1968 film to the modern version he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their lab apes developed their society where heston simply discovered that just somehow the apes <UNK> the earth while he was away is nicely done the second battle part comes as an anti climax that's because this movie has added the first two planet of the apes movies in one plot nice try but the chill you feel when <UNK> and you discover that he's lost on the planet forever just <UNK> out due to the uninteresting battle part br br fifth the ending for <UNK> who came up with that a <UNK> crashes twice with his escape <UNK> which seems an <UNK> object while the <UNK> manages to simply land <UNK> come on who'd believe that if the <UNK> are really small space <UNK> <UNK> simply flies off into space at the end and not merely escape <UNK> he might have managed a safe landing at least once no and what about that ending i mean in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth but here the whole movie takes place on a distant planet and suddenly the same there's a <UNK> statue ape culture is on earth how come did the apes of the far planet <UNK> <UNK> flew into the time storm and <UNK> earth before <UNK> mission took off why is <UNK> <UNK> stupid stupid stupid br br helena bonham carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape but i'd expected no less i preferred her ape above <UNK> warren as a human but maybe i got some loose wire in my head nevertheless the only convincing apes were tim roth as <UNK> wonderful and <UNK> household ape the ex general but i forgot his name br br <UNK> a lot of things could and should have been added altered to the 1968 <UNK> but not the plot at least not in that way it was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining it was nicely tongue in cheek and <UNK> don't <UNK> everything
<START> i really enjoyed this thriller i wanted to see it again as soon as it was over the cast was excellent the plot was suspenseful and entertaining and it was just an overall enjoyable movie i would rate this as one of the best thrillers i've ever seen the girls in it were really cute also especially denise richards she was very <UNK> throughout the movie and gave her character some <UNK>
<START> a low point in human interaction was reached by the <UNK> brothers with this film do remember you who used words like masterpiece when reviewing this film that these <UNK> creeps didn't just happen to drive to the <UNK> and happen to shoot film on some eccentric people no when they found these two poor pathetic people they then had to <UNK> their project and imagine what they told the money people to sell the project then they <UNK> the two extremely vulnerable women no meeting of minds here or real <UNK> participation these wretched <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ass did whatever they had to to get the <UNK> to <UNK> and then exploited them as <UNK> as has ever been done one would like to think that these <UNK> had occasional thoughts of <UNK> and guilt but the film making process given the <UNK> actual shooting and then editing took a lot of time and their goal had no <UNK> for actually relating to the <UNK> as human beings an exploitation film <UNK> by the <UNK> of people as time <UNK> their film making reputation has been seriously <UNK> by what they did here their reputation as human beings is <UNK> that is what people will remember them as grotesque <UNK>
<START> effect s without cause is generally not possible in the real world but in the world of hollywood remakes not only is it possible it's required the haunting has been given the computer treatment courtesy of a 1st class cinematographer turner director who once showed promise jan de <UNK> speed but has since produced a string of big budget garbage <UNK> speed 2 br br actor are superfluous in a movie of this type and they seem to realize it liam neeson and <UNK> zeta jones act like they wish they were anywhere but in this film <UNK> taylor makes an attempt to add something to the proceedings but whatever that something might be is unknown since the script feels like half of it is missing events just happen good and bad ghosts show up with no rhyme or reason and then the story just ends with a most unsatisfying non event meant to wrap up the previous 90 minutes of <UNK> br br there really isn't even reason to see this for the effects since we all know that anything can be put on screen now why not watch effects in the service of a good story instead of just for their own sake
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a really good actress but why she <UNK> in this lame written travesty is a mystery what could have been entertaining winds up as classic boredom the unique thing about <UNK> is that she can act as well as look real sexy as opposed to her partner <UNK> stabs who looks fine but it is obvious she spent the money for acting school at the <UNK> or <UNK> this was a production that cried out for some t a with a imaginative script writer could have achieved it in the flow of things however <UNK> does what she can under the circumstances to a extent <UNK> her reputation the <UNK> company should be aware that when you dress two attractive women in skimpy fetish cop uniforms the viewers will expect some fetish play t a <UNK> said
<START> don't listen to the many <UNK> and <UNK> comments <UNK> upon this film simply put as regards ninja movies this my friends is about as good as it gets br br yes it's silly yes the acting and script are admittedly absolutely atrocious but by <UNK> it's so much bloody fun in fact as is often the case with b movies the horrendous <UNK> which in the case of the movie in question is truly amongst the worst i have ever had the joy to behold and ridiculous <UNK> actually only serve to elevate the enjoyment level ten <UNK> br br obviously the fight scenes are the main attraction in this though and for the most part i'm pleased to say they're very well choreographed especially the final showdown during which we witness that ninja are not ostensibly <UNK> by the normal laws of gravity br br trust me on this if you are a fan of ninja movies and you have not yet seen <UNK> killers then you are truly missing out on what is in my opinion one of the true <UNK> in the crown of the genre
<START> very very <UNK> movie fare here with stella stevens taking directions from someone in disguise it didn't take me long to guess who it was in old <UNK> town outside vegas for a money heist in the circus circus hotel in las vegas stevens leads her girl gang of three and they find out that they must act much <UNK> than had been anticipated despite some neat looks at las vegas in the 70's very average yet credible acting from most involved and a plot line with potential las vegas lady lays one big boring egg it seems forever for the film to kick into gear and when it does it just <UNK> here and there and never really <UNK> up i was somewhat disappointed with this film sure i wasn't expecting anything great but i at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the 70's or something like it not even close no one dies there is a lame <UNK> between <UNK> stuart <UNK> and <UNK> george <UNK> one year prior to his grand performance as the <UNK> attorney <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> has all the suspense of watching a <UNK> there is one punch and one head hit with a blunt <UNK> beyond that nothing in terms of action and as for the girls don't expect much there either stella and her girls both very mediocre yet pretty talents get in a <UNK> and a bath what do we see nothing but a fleeting side profile stella wears these nice open <UNK> <UNK> her real talents but i wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance that way i could write one thing that would recommend the film alas it was not to be and i have little to say in this film's favor it isn't a horrible film in any way it just has nothing going for it either yawn
<START> after a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel all warm inside you're pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy then the movie takes a turn for the worse br br the warm feeling might still be there but as others has said the plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it's almost unbearable to watch br br the movie gets <UNK> up and you get the impression that you're either fast <UNK> through it or that the producers decided to fit it in less than <UNK> and had to cut a lot of scenes out br br realism isn't a goal onto itself but as a viewer i'm pretty convinced that this comedy isn't intentionally unrealistic it just happens to be br br on the plus side this movie has a couple of nice interiors and despite the bad script i think that the actors performances are mainly good if i could rate the first 25 minutes only i'd probably give it an eight as it is now it gets a four and that's being nice br br if you're a sucker for romantic comedies you'll probably have a great time anyways if not i'd recommend that you watch something else
<START> this movie is a classic in every sense of the word it is very entertaining and also very disturbing the acting in this movie is well done the story itself is believable suspenseful and well thought out character development is also done well the audience can clearly see how each of the characters is emotionally tested through this film the villains in this movie are very threatening from the first moment the audience sees them they can tell that they are up to something this movie shows how a human being when taken from civilization and put in the middle of the woods facing a life or death situation can slowly become almost as wild and <UNK> as the animals that inhabit it not everyone is going to like this film there is a lot of disturbing content that may make some viewers uncomfortable it is definitely worth watching this movie is a masterpiece
<START> i love the 80s slasher flicks and i remember when silent night deadly night was pulled from our theaters i was very disappointed so i was very excited to see some of these on fear net you better watch out was what i've come to expect of these types of movies the quality of the special effects were laughable by today's standards the character development too long but all in all it was laugh out loud funny br br the scenes where he loses it because santa aka dad is feeling up his mom and later when the mob is actually shown lighting <UNK> not <UNK> as you would in the 80s but real <UNK> really <UNK> my funny bone however the scenes where he was checking on the kids in his neighborhood gave me a creepy feeling of a different nature i also enjoyed trying to figure out who some of these character actors were it took me awhile to figure out that the main character was the lovable teddy bear on brothers
<START> this is a review of the later english release by disney featuring alison <UNK> patrick stewart and co br br i really wanted this film to be good really really i'm a huge fan of princess <UNK> and spirited away and after seeing all the glowing reviews on this earlier miyazaki film i was eager to see it but i was shocked shocked i say at the quality of this film those later films <UNK> well crafted plots 3 dimensional characters and the best film music since well ever this film just doesn't come close br br might as well start w the positive aspects though like all miyazaki films this one is still very imaginative with a bizarre fantasy sci fi setting in a post apocalyptic world where insects are the <UNK> species <UNK> can also <UNK> some far superior animation to other films from its time though not as beautiful and fluid as miyazaki's later films and the english voice acting is quite well done br br but this film just isn't good the characters are all cardboard from <UNK> sweet little <UNK> to the <UNK> evil <UNK> to everyone in between once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds you've seen all there is and the fact that the plot just <UNK> along doesn't help br br then there's the music now <UNK> is hands down my favorite film composer but <UNK> doesn't do him justice half the music is 80's <UNK> on <UNK> and it usually enters and leaves so abruptly that it <UNK> the visuals rather than helping them i highly suspect that <UNK> was told to <UNK> a lot of the music before he even saw the picture br br but wait there's a great message with this film right let's all save the environment too bad that this film hits you over the head with it like a <UNK> there is a scene in which <UNK> <UNK> a tree no really i ain't kidding br br it makes me a little sad to talk about how lame this film is but for some reason all the other reviews on imdb seem to adore it and when the characters have to talk to themselves in extended sentences to tell you what's going on that's lame br br if you're the kind of person who <UNK> anime enjoys 80's music and plants a tree every <UNK> day you will probably like this film otherwise save your money for his later films because they rock big time
<START> want to watch a scary horror film then steer clear of this one there's not enough beer in the world to make this film enjoyable br br however there is enough <UNK> single <UNK> if you can manage it br br if the previous comments weren't enough to keep you from watching this film sober allow me to assist <UNK> sends one man and two <UNK> extras into space to <UNK> <UNK> a really big <UNK> <UNK> causes colonel steve west to bleed from the nose things go downhill from there and <UNK> ensues br br i actually read the book adaptation which was published and released only in the uk miles better than the film and the book was dreadful at least some <UNK> is made towards suspense and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author's <UNK> with <UNK> br br not to say that the film is completely without merit rick baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before <UNK> on to a film and jonathan <UNK> found that he's really better suited to direct br br yes there is an mst3k episode featuring this flick but it is of course edited quite a bit without the obligatory flashing of the breasts not even the healing power of <UNK> can save you br br please just go watch <UNK> of the lost <UNK> if you want to see a guy melt see space <UNK> if you feel the need to see <UNK> i can not in all good conscience recommend this film to the sober film going public
<START> fiction film it lists as based on a story though it does have a documented by credit about a group of scientists going into the <UNK> of canada to try and find a bigfoot they want to capture one and then <UNK> a tracking device its lots of scientific <UNK> <UNK> mixed in what is really a dull film of a bunch of people wandering around in the wilderness there are some attempts at creating tension and scares but to be perfectly honest there is nothing here worth seeing outside of some great looking shots of the <UNK> this is a perfect definition of an exploitation film it promises you so much a look at bigfoot but in reality it delivers very little recommended for <UNK> only
<START> full of spoilers br br this is a pretty fast and enjoyable crime thriller based on ira <UNK> play about two gay <UNK> caine and reeve that plot the murder of one's rich wife cannon to get the property and the insurance the plot succeeds but christopher reeve as the younger and less established of the two writers decides to make a play out of the actual murder with only slight changes in the details reeve allows that <UNK> long island can become <UNK> long island in the script for instance the rest of the <UNK> plot is a dead <UNK> and to tell the truth reeve doesn't mind a little <UNK> or even an <UNK> into <UNK> apparently accidental death it will boost the <UNK> and his own <UNK> <UNK> br br michael caine is sidney <UNK> the <UNK> making playwright whose last four productions bombed and who would like nothing more than to quietly get back to working on a new play perhaps with <UNK> <UNK> that would redeem his reputation he cannot <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> play a <UNK> to be produced so what else he tries to murder him in the end they wind up killing one another the <UNK> is <UNK> by their neighbor the psychic <UNK> <UNK> and she makes a million bucks selling it to broadway br br it's a lot of fun for a number of reasons one is the production design that multi <UNK> multi <UNK> house with the big <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on nine of what must be the most valuable <UNK> on earth <UNK> would be a splendid set of <UNK> anywhere you wouldn't be able to afford a <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> the house is not overly large or <UNK> in its <UNK> it's just <UNK> modest although it's a little <UNK> for my tastes the kind of house that's so clean you're afraid to step on the thick carpet for fear of leaving the <UNK> of a foot br br next the acting could hardly be improved upon caine cannon and fred jones are superb <UNK> cannon gives a pitch perfect performance as the anxious wife whose <UNK> are so tight they look as if they'd been <UNK> on which is okay given her <UNK> even reeve whose talent was limited seems to find a comfortable <UNK> in his role of <UNK> but <UNK> murderer irene worth as the psychic neighbor <UNK> was in some way hard to define a mistake granted she or someone like her was necessary to the plot but my god what an offensive <UNK> her character is going around and claiming i feel pain in <UNK> <UNK> i suppose in order to make her a little more interesting she's got up in <UNK> and a goofy looking cap with <UNK> <UNK> on it still she's a <UNK> from beginning to end br br you have to love ira <UNK> bitchy dialog the <UNK> caine begs reeve to tell him why he wrote the tell all play because it's there sidney says reeve and caine shouts that's mountains not plays plays aren't there until some hole writes them great too is <UNK> call to the police after his wife drops dead of fright as planned he works himself up into a <UNK> of <UNK> barely able to speak as he reports the incident and <UNK> that an <UNK> be sent immediately when he hangs up his face assumes its usual <UNK> expression he blows his nose into his <UNK> and walks away all business again br br the climax though suitably ironic is confusing and <UNK> and full of <UNK> lacking in the wicked charm that <UNK> and lumet brought to the earlier scenes the score is mostly made up of light hearted <UNK> on the <UNK> neatly fitting into the film br br you'll probably enjoy it
<START> <UNK> <UNK> films are uncanny in the way that they aren't really edited for continuity but instead the shot seems to finish right where a memory has edited love <UNK> death is at times a quiet existential drama and a <UNK> creative magical <UNK> movie and either way treats the audience to a whole new aspect of the <UNK> <UNK> relationship or perhaps creates a new relationship that of <UNK> <UNK> br br the beginning is like a bizarre <UNK> horror movie a woman desperately runs around the house while a man lays dying in his bed did she kill him or what happened soon that tension is <UNK> as a doctor arrives and <UNK> him dead but from there a newer stranger drama begins the man wakes up and after being dead the woman and man fall in love to actually quite tragic consequences meanwhile their friends who are both priests watch on and submit their own debate into the nature of love faith and devotion br br <UNK> always seems to have some device to make these sorts of <UNK> work and what's so amazing about his films is that those devices always work in this case <UNK> <UNK> the scenes with shots of snow falling to an <UNK> <UNK> score which fades off and <UNK> into the subsequent shots that continue the story trapped in this <UNK> aside <UNK> the film develops a rhythm not too unlike an epic poem and i got strange flashbacks to <UNK> divine comedy from this one despite the lack of direct reference within the movie <UNK> is known as a very poetic filmmaker but this <UNK> past just the <UNK> structure to something that forces a degree of <UNK> in the viewer which has the possibility to bring to surface some odd <UNK> memory narrative <UNK> creates br br <UNK>
<START> come on what is the deal with this show power rangers anyways i always felt that the show which was originally brought over from japan in a better form took what was great in japan and turned into one of the most ridiculous and pointless excuses in toy <UNK> history there is absolutely no point with this show whatsoever br br the bad <UNK> bad costumes <UNK> etc all show what was ridiculous back in the 1990s from the two idiots bulk and skull to the <UNK> of the main cast jason <UNK> tommy <UNK> billy and <UNK> i just want to say one thing give me a break br br <UNK> brought this from japan and then disney bought the rights to this show around five years ago br br now the public has to endure reruns of this show on the disney channel and such br br all i can say once again is give me a break
<START> because of the 1988 writers <UNK> of america strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days it's pretty much crap <UNK> of repeat cut <UNK> clips from season 2 and was described by its writer maurice <UNK> as terrible just terrible br br why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent who knows i'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe <UNK> was too sick at the time to be able to <UNK> this half <UNK> this episode also marks the final appearance of diana <UNK> dr <UNK> <UNK> on the series
<START> the film must have been shot in a day there are scenes where you can see the camera <UNK> and its red <UNK> even the <UNK> green light that <UNK> with the actors the plot and the lines are really awful without even the slightest inspiration at least as a thriller genre movie everything that got to do with poe in the movie has a shallow and childish approach the film is full of <UNK> and no thrilling if you want to watch a funny b movie for a relaxing evening with friends then go for it you will enjoy it as i did but there's no way to take this film seriously
<START> ted v <UNK> film corpse <UNK> 2 is <UNK> minutes of excruciating cinematic <UNK> the plot is pretty much a mixture of nonsensical business <UNK> among people who <UNK> corpses into cat food while cat aliens who are losing a war with dog aliens looking to get some of this cat food watching this movie i began to look for any kind of distraction anything to <UNK> myself that i was doing something else besides losing my mind from the inside out br br several scenes go on for far too long as characters take forever to do simple things i've heard that mr <UNK> doesn't like to use jump cuts too often <UNK> that they will confuse his audience i'm not sure if this attitude is avant garde or just stupid try as i might i could not bring myself to care about any of the characters in the unnecessarily huge cast well with the possible exception of the old men who are the <UNK> of the factory the majority of the cast are a bunch of no talent amateurs who don't even bother to learn the lyrics to amazing grace before they have to sing it on camera although perhaps the blame should go to the poor sound quality since i only actually heard around 80 of the dialogue while watching the dvd br br this is quite possibly the worst film to ever be shot i've listened to snippets of the commentary and mr <UNK> comes off as a surprisingly sweet old man what the hell was he doing making this kind of trash i'd like to hear the explanations from the old men who had to lie <UNK> on a metal <UNK> belt waiting to be ground up movies i've long hated suddenly seem a lot better i long for the <UNK> appropriate music of <UNK> and the consistent lighting of dawn of the dead i need to go do something anything don't see this movie
<START> yes this is a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun that's because although the film clearly was horror some of the stories had a light spirit and there were even occasionally a few laughs this isn't at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit <UNK> and overly serious because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good it's one of the better movies of this style i have seen br br the <UNK> theme that <UNK> each story is the house itself four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the <UNK> br br the first segment starred <UNK> elliott as a horror writer who has writer's block so for a change of scenery they rent this house almost immediately <UNK> block <UNK> and he works <UNK> on a tale about a serial killer amazingly soon after his block <UNK> he begins to actually see his fictional character again and again the psychotic killer appears and then disappears making it seem as if he is losing his mind this might just be the best of the stories as the nice twist ending makes the story come alive br br the second while not bad at all is probably the weakest peter cushing plays a bachelor who is <UNK> for a girl friend who died some time ago though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary when he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this later a friend <UNK> <UNK> visits and he too sees the figure and is <UNK> by it this all leads to an ending that frankly was a bit of a letdown br br christopher lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl during most of this segment lee seemed like an idiot but in the end you can understand his demeanor though slow this one ended very well br br the fourth segment was the <UNK> and was meant to parody the genre jon pertwee the third doctor from the dr who television series is a very <UNK> actor known for his portrayals of dracula however nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of <UNK> he <UNK> off the set to find better props for this vampire film it's actually pretty interesting that he played this role as it seemed like a natural for christopher lee who played dracula or other vampires a <UNK> times give or take a few i enjoyed <UNK> line when he basically said that lee's and other recent <UNK> of dracula were all crap compared to bela <UNK> perhaps this is why lee didn't take this part despite some very silly moments it was very entertaining and fun possibly as good or better than the first segment br br considering that the film started and ended so well had excellent acting and writing it's hard not to like this film
<START> for the life of me i cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the jerry springer show it's so <UNK> trashy some ways sadly it's a guilty pleasure we all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode it's part of our pop culture i saw this on usa recently it's pretty bad i will admit that jerry does a horrible job of what i think he meant as acting or something like it jamie <UNK> is in it she's playing herself basically all she needed was her lover boy kid rock it would've been perfect then so i would recommend skipping <UNK> just watch the jerry springer show it's more enjoyable than this br br 2 10
<START> extremely well conceived part whatever happened to part behind the scenes <UNK> part reunion film all done in the same campy style that made the original series so much fun i only wish this had been done 10 years ago to include more guest villains who have passed on
<START> this italian movie is basically a soap opera with skin br br the vhs box said it was rated r but the into on the actual tape inside said it was x the latter makes a lot more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking even in the dark you could see dutch actress <UNK> <UNK> performing all sex on this guy and yes you could see his penis in her mouth i read somewhere that this was the first time where a <UNK> actress had done something like this on screen br br <UNK> <UNK> around in the nude on several scenes but her face was even better than her body she looked beautiful unfortunately the movie is ugly a real waste of time and certainly not recommended despite <UNK> looks
<START> since this is black history month and i'm reviewing the achievements of many african americans on film in <UNK> order i got this movie on vhs from the library because duke <UNK> and his orchestra were in it their jazz version of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was the highlight of this mostly overlong murder mystery musical comedy mixture many other numbers i liked were kitty <UNK> especially sweet marijuana carl <UNK> <UNK> for two as well as his <UNK> with <UNK> on that earlier and the ones by <UNK> michael who's great as the woman you love to hate jack <UNK> and victor mclaglen probably go a little too long with their love hate banter as the producer and detective but they grow on you and toby wing is a sexy dumb <UNK> as nancy who keeps trying to say something to <UNK> but gets a not now from him every time while many of the characters have a motive for the murders that happen i wasn't surprised by the revelation of who done it and get a load of how naked the women here are though of course their breasts are covered either by their hands or some flimsy top this was very obviously pre code worth a look for any film buff interested in this sort of thing p s as a long time <UNK> resident i like noting when someone was born here as <UNK> was a new orleans native
<START> my super ex girlfriend is an entertaining movie no more no less br br the story is quiet simple matt <UNK> luke wilson meets jenny uma thurman on the subway and <UNK> up with her in the beginning of their relationship everything seems to be ok but then matt finds out that she's g girl at first that seems really cool to matt but it turns out that g girl is very jealous and <UNK> so he decides to break up with her and hook up with his colleague hannah anna <UNK> this makes g girl very mad and she starts to avenge herself on her former boyfriend br br what i liked most in the movie are the scenes where g girl <UNK> herself on matt it was also nice to see anna <UNK> in another role then her character from the scary movie saga br br i give this movie a 7 out of 10 and recommend it to anybody who likes a nice comedy
<START> tsui <UNK> visual artistry is at its <UNK> in this movie unfortunately the terrible acting by <UNK> <UNK> and especially <UNK> cheung i felt the urge to <UNK> her while watching this it's that bad made it difficult to watch at times br br this movie is a real breakthrough in the visual department when i first saw this my jaw dropped repeatedly and i thought to myself that i've never seen anything remotely like it but this is how it should be done in order to do full justice to the mythical world of chinese historical kung fu novels without a doubt this is one of the best looking chinese historical kung fu epic ever made br br but alas tsui <UNK> hasn't improved much in the writing department and the story and dialog are rather juvenile his apparent obsession with the silly and overly long depiction of the evil guys didn't help either to make it worse this movie is very badly cast they decided to use the hot popular hong kong <UNK> as lead characters but unfortunately both <UNK> <UNK> and especially <UNK> cheung are totally <UNK> for historical kung fu dramas because they lack the <UNK> and <UNK> that such characters are supposed to <UNK> adam <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> lin in the 1983 version are infinitely better br br i wish that someday zhang <UNK> <UNK> and tsui <UNK> can join forces and produce a movie that has the visual artistry of tsui but with the maturity and story telling poetry of zhang
<START> annie <UNK> is the only highlight in this truly dull film mark <UNK> plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the <UNK> he and his classmates turned into a <UNK> quite possibly the <UNK> looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to las vegas with annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy br br i would have <UNK> out my eyes after watching this if it wasn't for the fun of watching annie <UNK> in a very early role and it's too bad for <UNK> that he didn't take a few acting lessons from her danny <UNK> also makes a goofy cameo
<START> i didn't think it was possible for a horror comedy film to fail so <UNK> on both <UNK> really awful the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously usually a good thing works against it primarily because the actors are so wooden you really would swear they are reading cue cards on the <UNK> though the mst3k version as always has a few laughs
<START> the release of tarzan the ape man in 1932 caused a sensation it may be hard to believe 70 years later but the film had much of the same kind of impact as the matrix or the lord of the rings has achieved at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment tarzan became an instant pop icon the <UNK> <UNK> that every woman <UNK> about and every man wished he could be the only person unhappy about the situation was edgar rice <UNK> who while he'd agreed to <UNK> creative liberties and enjoyed his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> felt the <UNK> <UNK> version of his character with no plans to allow him to <UNK> was <UNK> to his vision he would start a production company and soon be making his own <UNK> films mgm realizing the value of it's <UNK> <UNK> knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original and tarzan and his mate delivered br br the film had an interesting back story cedric <UNK> <UNK> legendary art director had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel prior to the release of tarzan the ape man despite the fact that he'd never directed before the studio hadn't anticipated the film's impact and didn't think a <UNK> director would matter much on a <UNK> film and they wanted to keep their oscar winning department chief happy <UNK> a <UNK> talented and imaginative visual artist loved the freedom of pre code hollywood and decided to have tarzan and his mate <UNK> the <UNK> to the limit tarzan and jane would <UNK> in a nude swim and jane would appear topless through most of the film maureen <UNK> said in an interview shortly before her death in 1998 that while a double was used for the swim she trusted the studio and did 'a couple of <UNK> of filming sans top but it became too much of a headache trying to <UNK> place plants and fruit to block her <UNK> and the idea was abandoned the film shot those days would be worth a fortune she did do a nude <UNK> scene in a <UNK> <UNK> her breasts at the conclusion of her <UNK> and <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> costume that was extremely provocative very thin and open at the sides and the resulting <UNK> would help <UNK> the <UNK> office and the self censorship that would soon <UNK> the entire industry br br mgm <UNK> <UNK> from the production the <UNK> reason given was his <UNK> as art director and veteran jack <UNK> was listed as the new director to <UNK> the critics although james c <UNK> actually directed the film as <UNK> was busy on 3 other projects including <UNK> villa br br the film <UNK> the best elements of the original <UNK> murderous <UNK> tarzan fighting jungle <UNK> to the death to save jane and actually improved on the storytelling harry holt neil hamilton from the first film returns to africa for <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> and to try to seduce jane into returning to england with gifts of <UNK> dresses underwear and <UNK> he brings with him martin <UNK> paul <UNK> a crack shot and <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> at <UNK> <UNK> pursuit of jane and stalks her as a potential <UNK> to be had by any means including killing tarzan if and when he can get away with it without being seen br br tarzan barely <UNK> the <UNK> into his happy life with jane and puts his foot down <UNK> to allow the hunters into the graveyard <UNK> finds his opportunity catching the ape man alone and shoots him then returns to the camp with a <UNK> story of his demise now jane has no reason to remain in the jungle and she can direct them to the graveyard before her long voyage back to england <UNK> by the oh so sympathetic <UNK> but a savage tribe and hideous torture <UNK> the group can tarzan being <UNK> back to health by his ape <UNK> recover in time to save jane br br while stock footage is again used <UNK> the racial stereotypes of the 30s are apparent and the <UNK> are obviously actors in ape suits tarzan and his mate achieves a level of sophistication <UNK> in any other <UNK> film as well as a <UNK> that even bo <UNK> blatantly erotic tarzan the ape man couldn't touch johnny <UNK> was in peak condition physically maureen <UNK> was never more beautiful and <UNK> never looked more romantic and dangerous br br tarzan and his mate was a triumph although it would be drastically edited for many years and remains the classic of the series to this day
<START> in this paranoia driven <UNK> our reporter hero battles <UNK> authorities <UNK> co workers <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and silent <UNK> aliens though capable of mind control and <UNK> objects from <UNK> it takes three of them to operate a control <UNK> of about two dozen buttons the script <UNK> from event to event leaving <UNK> <UNK> why did the aliens blind the dog why do they <UNK> the soldiers with radiation when they're only <UNK> an empty landing site and what space <UNK> worth their moon cheese <UNK> the ugly photographer first instead of his model <UNK> minds want to know writer director mario <UNK> apparently <UNK> his subject by <UNK> a stack of <UNK> themed <UNK> as he took in a <UNK> classics double feature the closing screen crawl boasts that it's based on actual events just like plan 9 some may feel burned by the abrupt finale but it should still appeal to conspiracy <UNK>
<START> as a jane eyre fan i was excited when this movie came out at last i thought someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author wrong if the casting director was <UNK> to cast a jane who was plain he certainly succeeded however surely he could have found one who could also act where was the tension between jane and rochester where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter <UNK> into the night seemingly from nowhere where was the <UNK> of the child who <UNK> and <UNK> like her mother finally why was the plot changed at the end one wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book what a disappointment
<START> jenny <UNK> from the <UNK> flick mistress of the apes the american slasher hell night and others is helen <UNK> an american actress who gets a lead role in an australian stage production she's a virgin because as a little girl she saw her mom having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her meanwhile a black <UNK> killer <UNK> around the theater <UNK> up people with <UNK> of glass br br major spoiler br br the killer is obviously helen she speaks in her dead mother's voice <UNK> blood off her hands after the murders and is seen killing a child <UNK> with a broken bottle as a little girl but this has gratuitous heavy breathing <UNK> camera work and <UNK> the identity of the murderer until the very end like it's supposed to be some big surprise br br the entire cast seems obsessed with talking about having or trying to have sex and in one case even <UNK> their way into getting laid there's quite a bit of nudity and blood but there's no sense of continuity the photography is murky and the editing by colin <UNK> who also scripted and produced is terrible the theater setting for a slasher film <UNK> <UNK> film of the same name and <UNK> opera both of which are better than this one by five years though and <UNK> is pretty hot
<START> i have complained to abc about the <UNK> of six degrees if enough people do the same then it could be enough to bring this fabulous show back to life just go onto the official site and the rest is simple enough i do not understand why this show has been cancelled what a fantastic show cast and characters the whole concept is gripping viewing i am <UNK> that my favourite show is over after just one series why is this six degrees is phenomenal it's better than so many other tv <UNK> out there until i heard they were stopping it from a friend it hadn't even occurred to me that this might happen
<START> as a comic book reader who still sees myself as a total kid at heart i admit i might have been a bit biased towards this movie i mean there hasn't been a good superhero movie out for quite some time note batman forever was not a good superhero movie i really wanted this film to be good and unlike most of my recent <UNK> to the cinema read blair witch project i wasn't disappointed br br mystery men was definitely not a high effects tension filled action flick it was a comedy and on that basis it was a success it had everyone in the small theater laughing and got applause and laughs right through the final scene stiller and <UNK> are hilarious together as always and <UNK> adds just the right touch of <UNK> william h macy plays a great straight man while <UNK> mitchell and the fart powered paul <UNK> are added just to keep the <UNK> happy br br though the sets are bizarre and at times seem like <UNK> from both batman and blade runner and some of the jokes are obvious it is still just plain funny there are some lines that will catch even the most jaded viewer off guard and bring tears from the belly <UNK> among us br br i definitely recommend this movie although not an all time classic it is twice as funny as the latest austin powers <UNK> the writing is good and the cast is great if you're worried plan on the <UNK> and pay less but either way you'll be pleasantly surprised i mean who among us doesn't root for the losers once in a while
<START> it helps immensely if one is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place first of all these ladies are not geisha they are <UNK> prostitutes in the <UNK> type green houses circa <UNK> give or take this should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware the film deals with issues of loyalty love and perhaps most importantly how people deal with <UNK> both their own and that of others in their immediate environment that plus the outrageous photography together with the <UNK> beautiful music make for a lovely ride just plug it in suspend your disbelief and enter their world you won't be disappointed
<START> this james bond game is the best bond game i have played in my life it is my favorite james bond game so far because br br the missions in this game are really fun they can be really hard that makes it more fun to play the missions have lots of actions the weapons you use are really good the cars in this game are awesome the car missions have lots of action and are really fun to play the voice over actors are really good and it is cool that sean connery does the voice for james bond also the way bond looks is really cool because it looks just like sean connery when he played james bond in the movies and the other character look pretty much the same as the look in the movie the graphics a pretty good in this james bond game also the game follows the movie pretty much but not all the but most of the time it does which is cool br br overall score out of
<START> if there was anything <UNK> kurosawa did wrong in making <UNK> <UNK> it was making it with the <UNK> he formed with the four knights the other three being <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> they wanted a big blockbuster hit to kick off their <UNK> and instead kurosawa arguably the head cheese of the group delivered an abstract <UNK> art film with characters living in a <UNK> <UNK> that had many of its characters face dark <UNK> had he made it on a more independent basis or went to another studio who knows but it was because of this among some other financial and creative <UNK> that also contributed to his suicide attempt in 1971 and yet at the end of the day as an artist kurosawa didn't stop delivering what he's infamous for with his dramas the strengths of the human spirit in the face of <UNK> that its backdrop is a little more unusual than most shouldn't be ignored but it's not at all a fault of <UNK> br br the material in <UNK> <UNK> is absorbing but not in ways that one usually finds from the director and mostly because it is driven by character instead of plot there's things that happen to these people and <UNK> challenge here is to <UNK> them into a cohesive whole the character who starts off in the picture oddly enough though thankfully as there's not much room for him to grow is <UNK> a brain damaged man child who goes around all day making train sounds the <UNK> <UNK> of the title only sometimes stopping to pray for his mother but then we branch off there's the father and son the latter who <UNK> <UNK> for food and the former who goes on and on with site specific <UNK> of his dream house an older man has the look of death to him and we learn later on he's lost a lot more than he'll tell most people including a woman who has a past with him a shy quiet woman who works in <UNK> to her <UNK> father or uncle i'm not sure who rapes her and a meek guy in a suit who has a constant facial <UNK> and a big mean wife to those who are social around br br there are also little <UNK> of people around these characters like two <UNK> who keep stumbling around every night like clockwork putting big demands on their <UNK> sometimes unintentionally <UNK> them and there's the kind sake salesman on the bike who has a sweet but strange connection with the shy quiet woman and of course there's a group of <UNK> ladies who <UNK> around a <UNK> hole in the middle of the <UNK> not having anything too nice to say about anyone unless it's about something erotic with a guy first to note with all of this is how kurosawa sets the picture it's a little post apocalyptic looking not of any particular time or place that is until in a couple of shots we see modern cars and streets it's a <UNK> society but the concerns of these people are however in tragic scope meant to be <UNK> through dramatic force like bergman kurosawa is out to <UNK> the <UNK> emotions of people with one scene in particular when the <UNK> looking man who has hollow <UNK> eyes sits ripping cloth in silence as a woman goes along with it br br sometimes there's charm and even some laughs to be had with these people i even enjoyed maybe ironically the little moments with <UNK> specifically with <UNK> cameo as a painter in the street or the awkward <UNK> with the man with the facial <UNK> but while kurosawa allows his actors some room to <UNK> his camera movements still remain as they've always been patient but alert with wide compositions and claustrophobic shots <UNK> visions and faces sometimes with the <UNK> of a silent drama meant as a <UNK> amid these sometimes bizarre and touching stories with some of them i e the father and son in the car especially sad kurosawa lights his film and designs the color scheme as his first one in <UNK> like it's one of his paintings lush <UNK> <UNK> at times over the <UNK> but always with some control this place is not necessarily lighter it's like the abstract has come full <UNK> into the scene where things look vibrant but are much darker underneath it's a brilliant <UNK> double edged sword that allows for the dream like <UNK> with such heavy duty drama br br with a sweet <UNK> score <UNK> <UNK> also responsible for ran and some excellent performances from the actors and a few <UNK> scenes in a whole fantastic career <UNK> <UNK> is in its own way a minor work from the director but nonetheless near perfect on its own terms which as with many kurosawa dramas like <UNK> and red beard holds hard truths on the human condition without too much sentimentality
<START> i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die <UNK> killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird judd nelson is cute at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley <UNK> brilliant movie
<START> i have seen virtually all of <UNK> <UNK> films and to me this is the funniest it reminds me of early jackie chan movies admittedly ms <UNK> may not be the greatest actress but she is very good to watch as both a martial artist and as a very cute young lady this film while probably not the best of all her films was the most entertaining
<START> this is an interesting true story of <UNK> grey owl who <UNK> of being an <UNK> when he was a child until the age of 17 he was born in england then moved to canada where he was <UNK> by <UNK> and he writes <UNK> in magazines and he wrote a book that <UNK> the attention of millions the book was of his life but at the end he told his wife that he was not a real <UNK> and she was fine with it and he died at the age of <UNK> two years after he went back into the <UNK>
<START> i am an avid fan of horrendous movies anything cheesy and down right ridiculous is my game so imagine my spirit i went to the local rent shop and found vampires vs zombies the name is just too entertaining you know that no one in the world could pull off something like it it just has to be bad br br and boy is it bad after viewing this horror <UNK> movie i was speechless literally me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes both of us <UNK> the future of our lives after watching this movie i broke the depressing silence with the words dude what yes i am an enthralling individual br br <UNK> a quick <UNK> <UNK> the plot there is none at all ever constantly in wtf mode the characters no development forgettable the music worse than porn the vampires theirs vampires the zombies theirs zombies br br in the end everyone should see this movie honestly its so bad i <UNK> to see it again so do yourself a favor watch it and get depressed
<START> it's sort of crazy but i taped from tcm both this german version of <UNK> anna christie and the english one but i got to see this one first <UNK> i'd heard that many people thought it was better than the english version br br without having seen the other one i cannot compare them but anyway this is an excellent early <UNK> with a straight from the heart performance by garbo she looks very beautiful in this film her face shines throughout especially when cameraman william daniels gets those gorgeous close ups of her br br the atmosphere of the film seems different from the regular mgm stuff made on that era it looks very similar to french or german <UNK> films from the thirties well it was directed by a great french director <UNK> jacques <UNK> who had directed garbo in <UNK> in the kiss br br theo shall is excellent and gives an <UNK> believable performance as <UNK> sweetheart the hard boiled tough sailor who's just a kid in man's body also hans <UNK> gives a very fine performance as <UNK> alcoholic father and <UNK> <UNK> too as a good hearted old cheap <UNK> br br in all quite an experience because it's the only film were you can listen to garbo speak in a foreign language <UNK> all the other films she did in either sweden or germany were during the silent era br br serious flick
<START> power play starts off interesting but it goes down hill fast the only good actor is <UNK> bell and he has a very small part beyond bell power play has no redeeming value or interest power play has more <UNK> in a few days than california has in a year the <UNK> scene in the mall is so contrived and completely unbelievable and all the action scenes look like a bunch of third <UNK> putting on a play it's awful simply awful br br bottom line if power play was made in the 60's or 70's it would be considered a poor b class movie the fact that power play was made in 2001 is really sad is there such a thing as a d class movie if so power play casts the mold
<START> i liked <UNK> performance but that's about the only positive thing i can say everything was overdone to the point of absurdity most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9 year old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded stone hearted cop or an ultra evil villain the <UNK> voice overs seemed amateurish to me i could go buy a cheap <UNK> and <UNK> out better opening music and what's with the whole <UNK> police torture stuff it was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story cox added a lot of things in fact that he apparently thought would be really cool but had nothing to do with the story that's a big disappointment because one of the things that makes <UNK> stories so good is his <UNK> they are tightly bound with no superfluous details this movie is just the opposite i stopped watching after the scene where <UNK> is questioning the guy from the <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> i wasted 4 renting this but at least i can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake
<START> this movie is awesome if you take it too seriously of course you will hate it however it's <UNK> of <UNK> and right <UNK> brings laughs and faint memories of about 15 years ago i like its ability to make me simply chuckle at obvious jokes and silliness and its ability to make me want to watch its <UNK> bill and ted's excellent adventure 1989 if you are looking for a film full of <UNK> jokes and totally mature humor don't watch it however if you want a film that is humorous and silly yet intelligent and engaging you will enjoy it i actually wish more of this sort of picture showed up in today's theatres and hey it's keanu reeves acting the way everyone parodies him as acting right doesn't get much better than that
<START> this hard hitting often violent western in the <UNK> <UNK> tradition is surprisingly directed by andrew v mclaglen whose previous westerns particularly those that starred john wayne were mainly in the john ford mode it is both surprisingly traditional good guys bad guys and incredible up to date as well br br heston portrays a former captain of the arizona <UNK> police who has been in retirement for a year having turned over the law <UNK> <UNK> to a <UNK> minded sheriff michael parks and finding his ways of <UNK> the law being taken over by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> in the first years of the 20th century but soon he is confronted with a menace from his past a half breed outlaw coburn that he put away more than a decade before for a train robbery that killed four guards in a subsequent shootout <UNK> wife was killed and so coburn is out for a most nasty sort of revenge it involves the kidnapping and eventually the rape of <UNK> daughter <UNK> by him and his gang the result is a taut and violent pursuit through the mountains and <UNK> of southern arizona br br the last hard men based on brian <UNK> novel gun down is violent in many places including the showdown between heston and coburn and the rape scene involving <UNK> and two members of <UNK> gang <UNK> <UNK> is probably every bit as questionable as similar scenes in straw dogs and deliverance but that doesn't detract too terribly much from the film's psychological approach to the western genre mclaglen is able to handle the bloody story with significant <UNK> and <UNK> performance as an aging <UNK> was probably the best one he ever gave in any of his 1970s films coburn makes for an especially cold blooded heavy and both parks and chris mitchum as <UNK> intended husband do good turns as well the music here is <UNK> from jerry <UNK> scores to 100 <UNK> and the 1966 remake of <UNK> but it still works here br br wisely filmed totally on location in <UNK> arizona and <UNK> the old <UNK> set the last hard men needs to be released by fox on vhs and or dvd soon it is a western that deserves nothing less
<START> i really enjoyed this movie and it was a little difficult do that when your brother is making stupid comments in it ever 30 seconds but this movie i enjoyed mostly because i'm used to the usual hk action films most of the films like this are don't watch it for the story line watch it for the mindless action and mindless action is right you get to see jet li jump spin kick punch shoot make impossible jumps and dodge countless bullets it's true that this movie was released to a <UNK> audience after li was in lethal weapon 4 that is one of the reasons the ratings on this movie dropped most people were probably expecting to see a movie that was as polished as a north american film but you need to remember most hk film budgets aren't nearly as high as a north american film and the style in a hk action film is usually very different usually <UNK> in wire work in a lot of them if you want to see a good action film you should see this just try to ignore the dubbing br br my rating was an 8
<START> beautiful story of <UNK> native dan <UNK> and his real life <UNK> struggle to win the 1994 olympic gold <UNK> in speed <UNK> despite his overwhelming emotional loss with the death of his much loved best friend and family member his sister jane br br this story's main focus is to <UNK> portray the real life emotional turmoil of grief that one feels in <UNK> a special loved one and the struggle to <UNK> cope and rise above the great loss it is the incredible story of dan <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> his beloved sister to <UNK> his struggle to cope with the intensity of his grief while still maintaining his dream to win at the <UNK> and his ultimate triumph in winning the gold <UNK> in speed <UNK> for america and in honor of his sister's memory thereby fulfilling his childhood promise to jane br br after dan <UNK> remarkable gold <UNK> performance in the winter olympic in <UNK> <UNK> he established a foundation in 1994 to help fight <UNK> which claimed the life of his sister and to support youth sports programs educational and <UNK> awards his dan <UNK> foundation <UNK> the philosophy that as his father always told him at a young age <UNK> is more to life than <UNK> around in circles ' maintaining a proper perspective is key so too is setting goals and realizing one's dreams through <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and never giving up br br recommended for anyone who has ever suffered the great loss of someone very special and <UNK> loved within your life and for anyone who still believes in the achievement of dreams and never giving up
<START> i don't know much about tobe hooper or why he gets his name in the title but maybe he shouldn't have bothered as another <UNK> mentioned there isn't really enough horror or <UNK> to bring in fans of either genre the plot is incoherent the <UNK> sequences are gratuitous and most of the acting is so so englund was doing his best with weak material and <UNK> <UNK> has a really great bottom but neither is enough to carry this film this one's a tape over grade f
<START> i have nothing to comment on this movie it is so bad that i had to put my first comment on imdb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting instead of watching this movie anything will do even stare at the walls is better br br and because i have to write minimum 10 lines of text i tell you also is a low budget movie bad acting no name actors a stupid <UNK> as the wolf and so on also the story brings nothing new the special effects are made in the 80's style br br the movie is almost as bad as the movie <UNK> br br so have fun not watching this movie
<START> man with the gun is pretty much forgotten now but caused a minor storm of media interest back in 1955 when robert mitchum turned down both <UNK> <UNK> in giant which had actually been written for him and which was subsequently <UNK> <UNK> and charles <UNK> intended version of the naked and the dead to make it instead despite some obvious production problems and some harsh lighting that occasionally <UNK> both mitch and jan sterling in <UNK> tones it's a terrific dark western that more than stands comparison with his earlier blood on the moon as his <UNK> <UNK> sets to work on a town that never had the chance to grow up before getting run down by the local <UNK> before turning out to  possibly  be almost as bad as the men he <UNK> certainly his way of dealing with news of a death in the family  burning a saloon to the ground and <UNK> its manager into trying to kill him  doesn't inspire much confidence in his <UNK> as well as a good script and a surprisingly good supporting turn from the usually irritating but here well cast henry <UNK> it also boasts a strikingly good early alex north score which even includes an early <UNK> for one of his tormented emotional <UNK> that would later turn up in <UNK>
<START> blood castle aka scream of the demon lover <UNK> of blood <UNK> the best but least exploitation cinema sounding title and so on is a very traditional gothic romance film that means that it has big creepy <UNK> a <UNK> young woman a mysterious older man hints of horror and the supernatural and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term it also means that it is very deliberately paced and that the film will work best for horror <UNK> who are big fans of understatement if you love films like robert <UNK> the haunting 1963 but you also have a taste for late 1960s early 1970s spanish and italian horror you may love blood castle as well br br baron <UNK> <UNK> carlos <UNK> lives in a large castle on the <UNK> of a traditional <UNK> european village the locals fear him because legend has it that whenever he <UNK> a woman she soon after ends up dead the <UNK> is that he sets his <UNK> dogs on them this is quite a problem because the baron has a very healthy <UNK> for women at the beginning of the film yet another woman has turned up dead and <UNK> br br meanwhile dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has appeared in the center of the village asking to be taken to baron <UNK> castle she's an out of <UNK> who has been hired by the baron for her expertise in chemistry of course no one wants to go near the castle finally <UNK> finds a shady individual who becomes even <UNK> to take her once there an odd woman who lives in the castle <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rejects <UNK> and says that she shouldn't be there since she's a woman baron <UNK> <UNK> over whether she should stay she ends up staying but somewhat reluctantly the baron has hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns which the <UNK> brother <UNK> is suffering from br br unfortunately the <UNK> brother appears to be just a <UNK> of <UNK> flesh in a <UNK> of bizarre <UNK> <UNK> and furthermore <UNK> is having bizarre <UNK> dreams just what is going on at the castle is the baron responsible for the crimes is he insane br br i wanted to like blood castle more than i did as i mentioned the film is very deliberate in its pacing and most of it is very understated i can go either way on material like that i don't care for the haunting yes i'm in a very small minority there but i'm a big fan of 1960s and 1970s european horror one of my favorite directors is mario <UNK> i also love <UNK> <UNK> work from that period but occasionally blood castle moved a bit too slow for me at times there are large <UNK> that amount to scenes of not very exciting talking <UNK> with scenes of <UNK> slowly walking the corridors of the castle br br but the atmosphere of the film is decent director <UNK> luis <UNK> managed more than passable sets and locations and they're shot fairly well by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> however blood castle feels relatively low budget and this is a roger corman produced film after all which usually means a low budget though often surprisingly high quality <UNK> so while there is a hint of the <UNK> of <UNK> colors and complex set decoration everything is much more <UNK> of course it doesn't help that the <UNK> print i watched looks like a 30 year old photograph that's been left out in the sun too long it appears washed out with <UNK> contrast br br still <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> occasionally set up fantastic visuals for example a scene of <UNK> walking in a <UNK> <UNK> that's shot from an exaggerated angle and where an important plot element is revealed through shadows on a wall only there are also a couple <UNK> <UNK> shots where actors are <UNK> <UNK> to imply complex relationships besides just being visually attractive and pulling your eye deep into the frame br br the performances are fairly good and the women especially <UNK> are very attractive <UNK> exploits this fact by <UNK> a decent amount of nudity <UNK> went on to do a number of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were other genres with english titles such as sex life in a woman's prison 1974 naked and <UNK> 1974 strip nude for your killer 1975 and erotic exploits of a sexy <UNK> 1977 blood castle is much <UNK> but in addition to the nudity there are still mild scenes suggesting rape and bondage and of course the scenes mixing sex and death br br the primary attraction here though is probably the story which is much a slow burning romance as anything else the horror elements the mystery elements and a somewhat unexpected twist near the end are <UNK> but in the end blood castle is a love story about a couple <UNK> various difficulties and <UNK> often with physical <UNK> or <UNK> to be together
<START> look it's the third one so you already know it's bad and maniac cop wasn't good enough to warrant the second installment so you know it's even worse but how much worse awful approaching god awful br br when maniac cop goes on a killing spree a reporter <UNK> what happened here can only be described as a black <UNK> of death br br 1 <UNK> are not black and can never be 2 <UNK> are harmless and can never <UNK> pain or death 3 a news reporter one valuable to his agency might find another way to describe the aftermath of a killing spree a black <UNK> of death is not the only way to describe the given situation br br this is what you're in for
<START> having seen the peter o'toole version recently i was ready to be <UNK> by the smart writing in this version little time is spent on the fighting which i prefer instead we are shown all the many motives underlying both the french and english who held <UNK> <UNK> and priests who put her to death even the worst <UNK> of them all the <UNK> leaves us with the thought that of course she was innocent the innocent have always had to suffer for the ambitions of the mighty she had no idea what she was saying no idea of the <UNK> of <UNK> or going against the church <UNK> she had no idea of what the <UNK> stand on such matters even was br br preminger was true to the <UNK> surrounding her death and i appreciated the preview on the tape that showed the flames reaching up and burning her why they used gas <UNK> in the movie and 2 of them were stopped up suddenly the air pressure blew out the <UNK> and the flames <UNK> up right on her thankfully for her they didn't have to repeat the shot as it was so realistic she was being burned pretty traumatic introduction for an <UNK> girl to her new career of acting br br john gielgud performed <UNK> he is the english <UNK> who is <UNK> the show he also makes the point that once you <UNK> someone to death you don't want to be around to watch them die you might shrink from your <UNK> the next time not that such <UNK> bother the soul of our would be president we christians even the most anti <UNK> have no problem with falling back on the old testament when it comes to capital punishment even though it was <UNK> by <UNK> words bring on public <UNK> like this little girl's <UNK> burnt flesh might bring us respectable folks to our <UNK> senses br br the only little <UNK> i have about this film is that we are not shown why the priest who has been so <UNK> <UNK> her burning becomes so suddenly so <UNK> even to the point of madness there should have been more <UNK> of his character more dialogue as the sudden <UNK> to his <UNK> doesn't make sense br br and whether graham greene does this deliberately or not st joan is such a self assured little <UNK> you almost but not quite are glad she meets her come <UNK> and when she turned down life in prison for some reason i thought of anne <UNK> the poet who accused sylvia <UNK> of <UNK> her <UNK> when she committed suicide knowing such an action <UNK> <UNK> you gotta wonder br br if ever there was a good example of obsessive thought and logic tight <UNK> this is one st joan should have turned <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> in her <UNK>
<START> i remember seeing this years ago when it first came out and i was <UNK> by parker <UNK> performance and the movie was pretty good also for anyone who's spent a little too much time in the nightclub after hours scene this movie will have a special charm for you not too serious mostly funny and parker posey definitely <UNK> her talented way through this indie gem br br i especially liked the diaz character reminded me of every single struggling dj i've ever known and many other movies could take a cue from this movie on how to <UNK> the virtue of responsibility without being boring and bland about it br br <UNK>
<START> this third pokemon movie is too abstract for younger kids to follow and too <UNK> to entertain older kids the message of the film about dealing with loss is <UNK> by the return of the young girl's father during the film's credits team rocket provide some amusement but they're not really part of the small plot so they don't appear very often
<START> <UNK> is a <UNK> typical tom and jerry short a situation is designed conflict <UNK> and mayhem ensues the characters behave in appropriate ways the natural tensions between various characters leads to general chaos the best and funniest part is when the peace <UNK> is in force and respected all sorts of strange wonders appear before your eyes a word of warning it is most <UNK> to allow tom to help you perform your morning <UNK> routine highly recommended
<START> this film has special effects which for it's time are very impressive some if it is easily <UNK> with the scenes played backwards but the <UNK> of moving images on an object on film is surprisingly well done given that this film was made more than <UNK> years ago
<START> there is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn't help with the major <UNK> to the movie i never understand why directors ask actors actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can't convince <UNK> just can't do irish and fitzgerald isn't much better at russian when the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing as the for the major problem the plot was there one i guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that i just couldn't wait for the film to end it was ridiculous save 90 minutes of your life and don't watch this movie
<START> i am starting this review with a big giant spoiler about this film do not read further here it comes <UNK> your eyes the main heroine the girl who always survives in other slasher films is murdered here there i just saved you <UNK> minutes of your life br br this is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the <UNK> despite killing the heroine off this is just <UNK> junk br br both priests and college students get a bad rap here they are <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> morons who have way too many internal problems to deal with what looks like junior college campus life and the college students come off even worse br br splatter university is just <UNK> to put in your vcr when you have nothing better to do although i suggest watching your head <UNK> tape that would be more entertaining br br this is rated r for strong physical violence gore profanity very brief female nudity and sexual references br br
<START> <UNK> gandhi the father of the nation in his quest for <UNK> freedom struggle ignored his own family and son this movie is about his son <UNK> who feels neglected because of <UNK> <UNK> service to the society the movie starts off in south africa where <UNK> gandhi works as a <UNK> and fighting the cause of <UNK> freedom against the british <UNK> arrives in south africa to help his dad who is a <UNK> since gandhi was involved in the freedom struggle he wanted his wife and children to join in too as a service to the society and as a result <UNK> does not get a chance to complete his education and fails his <UNK> he gets married to his love <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> against his father's wishes <UNK> has ambitions to travel to england and become a <UNK> just like his dad but his own dad refuses to grant him a <UNK> offered to his family by a businessman and instead gives it away to another person saying that the <UNK> should not be limited to his family and should be open to the most deserving student living in colony this <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> between father and son <UNK> <UNK> hates his father for <UNK> him and blames him for being <UNK> and unemployed <UNK> struggles to make ends meet and lands up on the streets through failed business attempts and in huge debt he loses his wife and children <UNK> <UNK> has give a stellar performance as <UNK> gandhi all kudos to him the direction and the script is fantastic the <UNK> is excellent overall an excellent movie and a must see i give it a 10 10
<START> start of with the good bit several times <UNK> talks <UNK> to his friends or that language is heard among the <UNK> that's a great plus as normally usa uk movie audiences think all people on this planet speak english just in case you're one of them no they don't br br but the acting is <UNK> as we say in the <UNK> it makes your <UNK> <UNK> and not in a good way i like <UNK> but in this he's awful the <UNK> in his jaws make <UNK> and he's <UNK> the whole movie some one must have told him it looks butch no patrick it looks silly and is <UNK> for lack of character alison <UNK> elizabeth has <UNK> for a style of acting that does not meet the style of her co workers her acting is <UNK> relaxed that this movie could have been set in the current days and it's not your <UNK> was a clue alison br br the best acting came from the people from the african continent and sided <UNK> as <UNK> i liked best clear warm and in character his performance is a joy to watch br br general it is <UNK> entertaining on a rainy day pity could have been better sack the director
<START> when you come across a gem of a movie like this you realize why the '80s were the greatest decade to live thru the rock music ruled so did movies especially horror movies filmmakers knew how to entertain us trick or treat is evident to this when rocker sammi <UNK> who was most likely written after w a s p singer <UNK> <UNK> dies in a hotel fire his 1 fan eddie is <UNK> he goes to friend local dj <UNK> gene simmons for support <UNK> gives him a copy of the very last recording that sammi made this is the only copy available it was given to the radio station to be played live halloween night when eddie plays it it somehow brings back sammi he helps eddie with the bullies at school but then goes out of control it is definitely one great movie the bad thing is this movie is out of print i paid 25 00 to finally get it off of ebay you should too well spent
<START> <UNK> <UNK> black mask is what i'd like to call a ballet with <UNK> and explosions sure the plot has been tried and heard before a <UNK> <UNK> soldier that is part of a elite fighting force of <UNK> that decides he feels that killing and <UNK> force aren't the ways to settle every thing and becomes a <UNK> and a <UNK> but when he learns that the rest of his group is trying to get an <UNK> that will keep them alive by taking on the police his best friend is a cop he becomes the black mask the style that the movie goes for very visual works and at least for me is entertaining i love martial arts movies that are a <UNK> people flying around lighter than air and recovering a split second after impact keeps the pace and action non stop but that is what this movie is about anyway right a showcase of jet li doing what he does best and that is spectacular <UNK> of his skills which to say the least are top notch as with most of the fast action martial arts movies ala jackie chan and sammo hung that are just now showing themselves here in the states for the first time these movies are low on plot and high on amazing physical <UNK> but i must say even with the large holes left in the plot like how do we see him safe in his apartment when just one scene before he had 20 men that are no more than 15 feet from him with sign of escape who knows the scene just cuts to him in the apartment <UNK> well suspension of belief i guess the movie to me stays interesting it is only until the last 20 minutes that the film seems to feel like it could have been a little shorter but still all around a great high paced action movie
<START> caught this film at the arizona international film festival i wasn't expecting a lot though the <UNK> director told me it was one of the best films <UNK> five minutes into it i was sold shot in b w on a <UNK> budget this film is hilarious the acting is solid the writing is solid and the look of the film is solid the acting is probably the biggest revelation since most films shot on low budgets tend to have amateur or <UNK> acting not this one it features one of the most convincing endearing and funny portrayals of a character with <UNK> syndrome i've ever seen the plot is convoluted without being confusing and raunchy without being gratuitous if you get the chance see this movie filmmakers like <UNK> hope i got that right deserve the chance to <UNK> their stuff to a wider audience
<START> note to all mad scientists everywhere if you're going to turn your son into a <UNK> mutated monster you need to give him a scarier name than paul i don't care if he's a frightening hammerhead shark with a <UNK> of <UNK> sharp teeth and the ability to <UNK> people in the water as well as on dry land give the kid a more worthy name like <UNK> rock or <UNK> because even if he eats me up i will probably just sit there laughing ha get a load of this paul the monster is ripping me to <UNK> that's the worst part about this movie is this shark thing is referred to as paul throughout the entire flick it makes what could have been a decent scary horror movie just seem silly not that there aren't other campy and contrived parts of hammerhead shark frenzy the scientists spend the entire movie wandering along this island and all of a sudden one of the girls starts <UNK> <UNK> from walking in the lush forest and just has to pour water on her feet to <UNK> the <UNK> which of course allows paul to come out of the water and kill her the one thing scifi channel did right in this movie was let the <UNK> live but that's a small silver <UNK> in an otherwise disappointing movie
<START> and after seeing this pile of crap you won't be surprised that it wasn't published br br spoilers br br this is a terrible movie by any standards but when i point out that it's one of the worst movies that has the name stephen king in the credits you can start to imagine how bad it is the movie starts of with two characters staring open mouthed at a scene of horror br br my god what happened here br br i don't know but they sure hate cats br br the camera pans to the outside of a house where hundreds of cats are strung up dead and <UNK> boy this guy is right someone does hate cats and with a <UNK> like that he should be a policeman oh wait a minute he is a policeman and when a movie starts with a cop making an oh so obvious observation you just know you're going to be watching a bad movie br br the reason <UNK> is bad is that it's very illogical and confused we eventually find out the monsters of the title need the blood of <UNK> to survive would they not be better looking for a virgin in the mid west bible belt rather than an american <UNK> town having said that at least we know of the monsters motives that's the only thing we learn we never learn how they're able to change shape or are able to make cars become invisible and this <UNK> with the ending that seems to have been stolen from the terminator monster mother walks around killing several cops with her bare hands or blowing them up via a police issue hand gun but if her monster breed is <UNK> from police fire power then why do the creatures need the ability to change shape or become invisible the demise of the creatures is equally ill thought out as there killed by a mass attack of household cats if they can be killed by cats then why did the monsters not kill all the cats that were lying around the garden there was a whole <UNK> of <UNK> sitting around but the monsters never thought about killing them i guess that's so the production team can come up with an ending it was that they started the movie my complaint lies br br we're treated to several scenes where famous horror movie directors like john <UNK> clive barker and even stephen king make cameos i think the reason for this is because whenever a struggling unknown actor read the script they instantly decided that no matter what they weren't going to appear in a movie this bad so stephen king had to phone up his horror buddies in order to fill out the cast that's how bad <UNK> is br br unbelievable as it seems that wasn't the worst line in the movie the worst line is that cat saved my life
<START> truly shows that hype is not everything shows by and by what a crappy actor <UNK> is and is only getting movies because of his dad and his wife amitabh as always is solid ajay <UNK> as always is <UNK> and useless and the new guy is a joke the leading lady is such a waste of an actor such pathetic movie from such a <UNK> director and from such a big industry with movies as such i have <UNK> the amount of bollywood movies i watch br br <UNK> has been making very crappy movies for a while now time to get different actors <UNK> anyone bollywood needs <UNK> and <UNK> back every other leading lady is a half naked wanna be <UNK>
<START> i watched the babysitter as part of <UNK> <UNK> drive in cult classics featuring crown international pictures releases on dvd i think it is a very good film br br this movie packs a lot of story into a very short time you have hippies rock music <UNK> lesbians sexual <UNK> blackmail and murder all in one spot br br the lead actors do a credible job and i found the <UNK> woven plot to be believable and interesting br br however the supporting cast primarily the <UNK> delivers a stilted performance particularly when asked to deliver lines with more than just a few words perhaps they used real <UNK> instead of actors a couple of the characters in particular were exceptionally believable br br the musical score is absolutely spot on for the times the <UNK> and for moving the story forward i found the music a real treat i noticed in the opening credits that the movie featured the music of the food i <UNK> them but couldn't find anything br br in any case george e carey who wrote produced and starred in this movie liked the idea so much of a <UNK> married man brought to redemption through trials and <UNK> and a little help of course that he wrote produced and starred in weekend with the babysitter
<START> not really a big box office draw but i was <UNK> surprised br br with this movie james i did some things to farrah fawcett <UNK> br br co wrote and directed this movie about an ordinary average guy br br named larry <UNK> who thinks his life would have been br br incredibly different if he hit a <UNK> at a key baseball game br br when he was 15 but thanks to mysterious and magical bartender br br mike larry gets his wish yet soon realizes that his new life br br isn't exactly as he hoped it would be br br i must say this movie really impressed me critics have given br br it mixed and i must say the concept is really interesting and br br pulled off well yes it is a little standard but packs enough br br funny moments drama and excellent acting to make it really br br good james belushi i think was oscar worthy for his role jon br br <UNK> is perfect and linda hamilton plus <UNK> russo shine in br br their roles michael caine is perfect as the bartender it's br br just a good movie with a good lesson if you've never seen i br br highly recommend you check
<START> our <UNK> gives us the lives of the three teenagers <UNK> maria and <UNK> best girlfriends hanging at the end of summer adolescent summer even if we don't know the <UNK> and <UNK> of this particular <UNK> crown heights brooklyn is was the same for us all a lazy <UNK> from the <UNK> and <UNK> of school welcome heat and <UNK> br br but if this experience of <UNK> is universal the inner city of the 90s is a different place than most of us know maybe as foreign a country as any young bodies <UNK> new <UNK> <UNK> new territory the <UNK> towards <UNK> the young mind coming into itself speaking for itself saying this is who i am this is who i want to try to be it is was always thus but this is how it plays out in brooklyn in the late 90s br br jim <UNK> is the writer director of this film project but he <UNK> all who have <UNK> <UNK> at him the opening title slide a film <UNK> seems to list everyone in the universe it's a gesture but by the end of the film we know it to be a genuine one the closing titles also have some of the most on the money and <UNK> credits i've read the vivid sound recording by jan <UNK> deserves to be especially noted <UNK> a modest leader who knows who is telling this story it's his three <UNK> <UNK> maria and <UNK> they're the real thing their interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus of reality this ain't no music video <UNK> telling of teenage life it has the seriousness of the long <UNK> stare br br hanging out with them we don't quite feel included but we do feel <UNK> to be listening in these are real voices speaking with <UNK> about the <UNK> and <UNK> of daily life we are witness to the modern <UNK> of teenage life how its problems are interpreted <UNK> and summed and solved small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout <UNK> hangs with her dad at his security job it's the only way she gets to spend time with him we see the love that exists between them but also the failures of family and <UNK> in a connected scene <UNK> <UNK> her dad to her mom and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and for them to love her in return later the three friends lay in the dark sharing visions and dreams and we remember how crazy funny kids are and more <UNK> how realism <UNK> <UNK> these days and at the end maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself we see her gather up the courage to hold all her fears and doubts at bay she demonstrates for us the strength one needs to have to be able to embrace the <UNK> that makes life <UNK> br br our <UNK> greatest gift is that we really feel deeply the terribly <UNK> nature of friendship how one day alive and <UNK> that <UNK> can in the next just turn and drift away it's awful but that's just the way it is isn't it
<START> i really like richard gere i always have and it seems as of late that his status as a hollywood star and money maker has slipped but it would appear to me that the reason is that he is taking very mature intense roles and has been very successful at it just not <UNK> because i have seen him in some truly great gems as of late including the <UNK> the hunting party both must see films see my reviews and now this the flock which apparently was meant to be a big release considering it's substantial 35 million budget it seems that some of the other imdb reviews are very very harsh because i thought the film dealt with a potentially very serious social issue in a very direct violent and disturbing way and gere just brings it all home it's an action thriller drama that kept my glued to the television with it's story i think part of the problem that people seem to have with it is that it hollywood <UNK> a very serious issue but i don't think it does it with <UNK> but rather tries to take a different spin to make people aware that this exists in fact it's much the same way that the hunting party dealt with war hong kong director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> did a decent job holding it together but i think the cast is what made it watchable br br richard gere as you may have guessed from my previous comments is brilliant as a social worker of sorts <UNK> <UNK> who has kind of created his own style and laws when it comes to keeping track of his flock who are <UNK> violent sex <UNK> he holds no punches in tracking these people following them and making absolutely sure they don't re offend and if they do he'll be the one to identify and stop them any way he can gere is so intense and looks <UNK> from this job and he's become violent and angry at watching these monsters loose on the street he is just fantastic claire danes is also terrific as <UNK> new partner and his replacement who he has to train to do his job <UNK> character is far more typical social worker and is a little taken <UNK> by <UNK> style and methods but slowly realizes what he is trying to accomplish and go up against the two of them are brilliant together and have terrific chemistry with such vastly different characters <UNK> <UNK> plays a disturbed <UNK> <UNK> who appears to be torn from the <UNK> as she plays a character very reminiscent of <UNK> <UNK> paul <UNK> wife who is now out for those of you who follow canadian serial killers her character goes a little over the top but she is convincing and horrifying all at once russell <UNK> has a small role as <UNK> new boyfriend and he would have been better probably given a bigger role ray wise who is a terrific character actor check him out in dead end as well as the amazing turn as satan himself in the wb show <UNK> and he gets a small but good role as the head of the public safety department and <UNK> boss br br the movie isn't perfect despite the terrific performances of it's lead cast it takes liberties by really trying to make the film more entertainment than educational but it's just a different angle not unlike the nicholas cage dud <UNK> the flock takes you into the <UNK> of the sex trade kidnapping human <UNK> and more and is just really something to watch perhaps it wasn't directed or written as well as it could have been but i am telling you that danes and gere together make this movie completely watchable and a really great thriller it's disturbing but also something that isn't very complex and yet <UNK> character in many ways is intensely complex with many layers and also opens social <UNK> and makes you contemplate about <UNK> in many ways when you see the people gere deals with i encourage you all to ignore poor reviews and see it for yourself because it's worth checking out 8 5 10
<START> i love this movie and never get tired of watching the music in it is great any true hard rock fan should see this movie and buy the soundtrack with <UNK> like gene simmons and <UNK> <UNK> you can't go wrong
<START> stories of the century was a half hour series and appeared in first run <UNK> during the <UNK> <UNK> television season it was also the first western tv series to win an emmy award starring veteran western actor jim davis as <UNK> detective matt clark the series set clark and his fellow <UNK> detective partners mary castle as frankie adams for the first half of the season and <UNK> miller as <UNK> during the second half against historic western <UNK> of various periods ranging from the mid <UNK> to the early <UNK> the series was very satisfying easy to watch and fairly realistic due mainly to the <UNK> charm of jim davis in the lead role he seemed like an actual western character one other note when matt clark would arrive in town after a long ride he actually looked like he had been on a long horse ride as he would be covered in dust br br a very good early adult western
<START> kate miller angie dickinson is having problems in her marriage and otherwise enough to see a psychologist when her <UNK> gets her into trouble it also involves a <UNK> liz blake nancy allen who becomes wrapped up in an investigation to discover the identity of a psycho killer br br dressed to kill is somewhat important historically it is one of the earlier examples of a contemporary style of thriller that as of this writing has <UNK> all the way through hide and seek 2005 it's odd then that director brian de palma was basically trying to <UNK> hitchcock for example de palma literally lifts parts of vertigo 1958 for dressed to <UNK> infamous museum scene dressed to <UNK> shower scenes as well as its villain and method of death have similarities to psycho 1960 de palma also employs a prominent score with <UNK> <UNK> in the style of hitchcock's favorite composer bernard <UNK> the similarities do not end there br br but de palma whether by accident or skill manages to make an <UNK> turn from or perhaps <UNK> his influence with dressed to kill having an attitude structure and flow that has been influential maybe partially because of this influence dressed to kill is also deeply flawed when viewed at this point in time countless subsequent directors have taken their hitchcock like de palma and <UNK> it <UNK> nearly every element so that watched now after 25 <UNK> worth of influenced thrillers much of dressed to kill seems <UNK> paced <UNK> clunky and plot wise inept br br one aspect of the film that unfortunately hasn't been improved is dressed to <UNK> sex and nudity scenes both dickinson and allen treat us to full frontal nudity allen's being from a very <UNK> angle and de palma has lingering shots of <UNK> breasts strongly <UNK> masturbation and more visceral sex scenes than are usually found in contemporary films quite a few scenes approach soft core porn i'm no fan of <UNK> quite the opposite our <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> attitude towards sex and nudity is disturbing to me so from my perspective it's <UNK> that dressed to <UNK> emphasis on flesh and its pleasures is one of the few aspects in which others have not strongly followed suit or <UNK> the film perhaps it has been desired but they have not been allowed to follow suit because of cultural controls from conservative stuffed shirts br br de palma's direction of cinematography and the staging of some scenes are also good enough that it is difficult to do something in the same style better than de palma does it he has an odd characteristic approach to close ups and he's fond of shots from interesting angles such as <UNK> views and james whale like tracking across distant <UNK> in the sets of course later directors have been <UNK> but it's difficult to say that they've been better viewed for film making <UNK> at least the museum scene is remarkable in its ability to build very subtle tension over a dropped <UNK> and a glance or two while following kate through the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> museum of art br br on the other hand from a point of view caring about the story and especially if one is expecting to watch a thriller everything through the museum scene and slightly beyond might seem too slow and silly because of its <UNK> from the main genre of the film and its primary concern with directorial <UNK> as well as cultural facts <UNK> to the film the opening seems like a not very well integrated attempt to <UNK> and be <UNK> once the first murder occurs things improve but because of the film's eventual influence much of the improvement now seems a bit clichéd and occasionally hokey br br the performances are mostly good although michael caine is underused and dickinson has to exit sooner than we'd like but the exit is necessary and very effective dressed to kill is at least likely to hold your interest until the end but because of facts not contained in the picture itself hasn't exactly aged well at this point it is perhaps best to watch the film primarily as a historical <UNK> and as an example but not the best even for that era of some of de palma's directorial flair
<START> this is far more than the charming story of middle aged man discovering the pleasures of ballroom dancing although it is that as well it's the tale of one person learning to love life again pushing past all the <UNK> of work and money to discover joy once more the bonus in this film is a fascinating insight into the slowly changing attitudes of modern japan toward everything from ballroom dancing to physical contact there are scenes that will make you laugh out loud a few where you'll want to get up and tango and many others where you'll just feel good br br this is a great introduction to contemporary japanese filmmaking for those who might be under the impression that all japanese movies are heavy and <UNK> br br
<START> i started watching this movie expecting some barely tolerable hammer horror film wannabe and i wasn't far off there's a fair amount of <UNK> gore and they threw in lots of nudity but the latter half of the movie presents a few ironic twists holy cow they actually put a little thought into the story and didn't completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset and dare i say it some of the gratuitous nudity wasn't so gratuitous after all because it fit in with the story and setting br br don't get me wrong it's still overall a bad movie but as bad movies go it's a <UNK> more intelligent than the really horrible tripe like <UNK> of lost women and robot monster
<START> <UNK> a very odd film and in many ways a very good one br br my first thought after viewing was how the hell are they going to market this thing if shaun of the dead is a romantic comedy with zombies fido is a boy and his dog story <UNK> with fifties nostalgia comedy with zombies doesn't exactly trip off the tongue br br fido has little of <UNK> carnage gore belly laughs it is a different beast altogether forgive the pun br br fido kicks off with a black white information film that explains the back story humans have won a war against zombies by developing a control collar that <UNK> the flesh <UNK> into dumb servants br br at first i thought we we were in for a fifties cold war paranoia parody a la <UNK> but we are soon <UNK> into a world of bright primary colours and fifties middle class nostalgia br br young timmy <UNK> is a lonely kid who doesn't fit in at school his mom is would be social <UNK> and his dad is <UNK> and detached br br seeking to keep up with the <UNK> mom carry anne moss has acquired a zombie jimmy is <UNK> at first but <UNK> billy <UNK> soon proves a great buddy for jimmy until his collar goes on the blink br br fido is not a horror film but my problem with the movie is <UNK> out exactly what it is br br much of the humour is of the light family variety and sometimes the plot line is too heavily <UNK> on the boy and his dog family moments br br yet the film is shot through with wonderfully dark truly funny moments which while welcome will ensure an r rating for what is for extended periods a family comedy br br the film looks gorgeous and is wonderfully performed by all involved br br despite its difficult <UNK> problems i hope this movie finds a <UNK> as it's quite a little gem in this year's <UNK> of cinematic crap
<START> los angeles tv news reporter jennifer the beautiful barbara bach of the spy who loved me fame and her two <UNK> karen the <UNK> <UNK> karen <UNK> and <UNK> the pretty lois young who not only gets killed first but also <UNK> her <UNK> <UNK> in a tasty gratuitous nude bath scene go to <UNK> california to cover an <UNK> danish festival since all the local <UNK> are <UNK> solid the three lovely ladies are forced to seek room and board at a <UNK> but foreboding remote mansion owned by freaky ernest <UNK> deliciously played to geeky perfection by the late great sydney <UNK> and his meek sister virginia a solid <UNK> <UNK> unfortunately <UNK> has one very nasty and lethal dark family secret <UNK> in his <UNK> basement a <UNK> pathetic <UNK> incest <UNK> man child <UNK> named junior an alternately touching and terrifying portrayal by stephen <UNK> <UNK> in animal house who naturally gets loose and <UNK> some murderous havoc <UNK> directed by danny <UNK> with uniformly fine acting from a <UNK> cast a <UNK> perverse plot excellent make up by craig <UNK> a nicely creepy atmosphere a wonderfully wild climax a slow but steady pace likable well drawn characters and a surprisingly heart breaking final freeze frame the incest subplot packs an unexpectedly strong and poignant punch this <UNK> overlooked early 80's psycho sleeper is well worth checking out
<START> i've read many negative reviews of this movie and finally got a chance to see it on dvd to be honest i really don't know what the problem with it is br br it's a decent murder mystery thriller shown from various points of view from an eccentric cast of often drugged out potential killers suspects including the late porn king john holmes please read the plot synopsis for the exact details of the movie's plot i wish to contribute more to a review than a synopsis br br many reviewers went so far to give this movie their lowest rating due to violence but i really don't see it many modern movies were worse saving private ryan was ultimately more violent than this movie which often relies on implied blood <UNK> than actual brutal <UNK> the murders depicted in this film were done with lead <UNK> <UNK> br br i was enthralled with both <UNK> of the movie the first showing john holmes as a hopeless cash hungry drug addict and the second half showing his side as a minor <UNK> in a senseless bloodbath the movie has excellent acting even though dylan <UNK> looks more than a bit out of place in his biker <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> bad boy personality br br the soundtrack was also awesome a fantastic mix of 70's b side rock and obscure pop spread out over a couple of hours in all the right places ala boogie nights
<START> mary pickford often stated that tess <UNK> was her favorite movie role well said she played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced she not only had to purchase the rights from <UNK> <UNK> but even give him credit on the film's main title card needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning indeed in my opinion the movie itself rates as one the all time great experiences of silent cinema br br true director john s robertson doesn't move his camera an inch from start to finish but in <UNK> <UNK> hands this <UNK> not only doesn't matter but is probably more effective a creative artist of the first rank robertson is a master of pace camera angles and montage he has also drawn brilliantly natural performances from all his players jean <UNK> who <UNK> the heavy is so <UNK> repulsive it's hard to believe this is the same man as kindly dr christian while lloyd hughes <UNK> one of the best acting jobs of his entire career true it's probably not the way mrs white intended but it serves the plot admirably as otherwise we would have difficulty explaining why the <UNK> spent a fortune on defense but made not the slightest attempt to <UNK> who actually fired the gun that killed his future brother in law needless to say this particular quality of the likable hero is <UNK> by jack <UNK> in the <UNK> 1960 version which also totally <UNK> the author's <UNK> attack on smug middle class christianity notice how the well washed priest here moves forward a pace or two in surprise at the <UNK> but then makes no attempt whatever to assist our <UNK> little heroine in the performance of duties that he himself was supposedly <UNK> to <UNK> this is a very moving scene indeed because it is so realistically presented br br tess also provides an insight into the work of another fine actress gloria hope whose work was entirely confined to silent cinema she married lloyd hughes in <UNK> and retired in <UNK> to <UNK> her life completely to her husband and their two children lloyd hughes died in 1958 but she lived until 1976 easily <UNK> in <UNK> but i bet no one had the brains to interview her another opportunity lost br br to me forrest robinson only made a <UNK> impression as <UNK> i thought he was slightly miscast and a brief glance at his filmography proves this he usually played priests or judges but david <UNK> as usual was superb br br in all an expensive production with beautiful photography and marvelous production values
<START> i remember this show being on the television when i was a kid back in the early 1990s and there was this rage about kids with goofy <UNK> doing kung fu on one another and riding around in plastic dinosaurs it was called power rangers i remember that little kids would go around hitting each other and then the shirts and the stuff from the show was banned in many school <UNK> all over the country because this show taught kids how to fight each other in solving their differences br br i never really thought of this as a show especially when better shows like the <UNK> were playing on fox kids most older teens always looked at power rangers in a ridiculous and <UNK> manner and it's not hard to wonder why the footage is ridiculous at best the colored rangers costumes look like stuff you would work out in and the dinosaurs look like plastic nonsense then you get into the acting and of course those really laughable <UNK> all the guys run around with <UNK> on half of them are wearing 90's <UNK> and they always wear the same clothes everyday and then change into <UNK> wearing power rangers br br the toys are especially ridiculous as well and was the joke of many late night talk show <UNK> and of course two of the worst movies ever made and i do mean two of the worst movies ever made were based on this show with nearly every critic <UNK> both the films and the shows it was based on br br power rangers is nothing more than a bad television <UNK> for especially bad toy <UNK> as an adult i don't look at it <UNK> but rather as another embarrassment of 1990s kids shows fashion and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> scifi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately such as <UNK> or dog soldiers grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic beowulf however it <UNK> so much and offers so little in comparison that the <UNK> on television might as well have titled it <UNK> <UNK> christopher <UNK> <UNK> i wasn't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown hollywood production but i did however expect the <UNK> <UNK> to not <UNK> with the actual story even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour <UNK> flow nicely in the <UNK> time <UNK> br br did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing did any research go into this obviously not as one could tell from the massive <UNK> <UNK> that beowulf and his crew save for <UNK> boy are wearing one major problem i have though was with the very look of <UNK> beowulf is supposed to <UNK> him shouldn't he not have been sixteen feet tall and <UNK> 2 tons <UNK> death segment was also lacking in every way  in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script for example grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the <UNK> by beowulf  not cut off at the <UNK> after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a <UNK> that looks like it <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies when he <UNK> to his wounds and honestly what the hell was with that <UNK> br br if you want to see this movie because its connection to the <UNK> don't as there really isn't one other than character names the only way i could recommend this film is if you liked the movie <UNK> directed by jacques <UNK>  although i don't recommend watching either
<START> <UNK> is the first good film in bollywood of 2001 when i first saw the trailer of the film i thought it would be a nice family movie i was right salman khan has given is strongest performance ever my family weren't too keen on him but after seeing this film my family are very impressed with him <UNK> and <UNK> are wonderful the film is going to be a huge hit because of the three main stars br br it's about raj salman khan and <UNK> meeting and falling in love they get married and go to switzerland for their honeymoon when they come back raj and <UNK> find out that <UNK> is pregnant <UNK> family are full of joy when they find out especially <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> raj and his family are playing <UNK> one day and <UNK> has an accident which causes <UNK> to have a <UNK> raj has a very close family friend who is a doctor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he tells raj and <UNK> that she can no longer have anymore kids raj and <UNK> keep this quiet from the family raj and <UNK> decide to go for <UNK> <UNK> to them is that they will find a girl and raj and that girl will have a baby together and then hand the baby over to raj and <UNK> raj finds a girl her name is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she is a dancer and a prostitute raj tells her the situation and <UNK> her with money and she agrees raj changes <UNK> <UNK> raj tells <UNK> that he has found a girl <UNK> and <UNK> meet and become friends they go to switzerland to do this so no one finds out <UNK> spends the night in a church and raj and <UNK> are all alone and they spend the night together the doctor <UNK> that <UNK> is pregnant and they are all happy raj tells his family that <UNK> is pregnant they are happy again <UNK> comes to love raj and she wants him what happens next watch <UNK> to find out br br the one thing i didn't like about the film is their idea of <UNK> they should have done it the proper way in the film but it didn't ruin the film it was still excellent br br the songs of the film are great my favourites are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mann and <UNK> the song <UNK> is very colourful in that song it shows the <UNK> <UNK> taking place and it is very colourful the film deserves 10 10
<START> the social commentary was way overblown and the mystery itself is built and solved through a series of implausible <UNK> that were entirely unbelievable nothing has changed in <UNK> personal life in the past decade that makes it remotely interesting br br i even had trouble understanding why he was complaining about his stay in australia as compared to the opportunities to solve mysteries that he has in england can he not <UNK> himself on the australian police it seems like a very artificial plot point to get him involved in a crime investigation br br the latter episodes of the original series were pretty melodramatic and implausible sometimes <UNK> on silliness and this one picks up that <UNK> rather than returning to the focus of series one sad
<START> human pot <UNK> joe don baker mitchell stars in this dull <UNK> <UNK> movie as deputy <UNK> a fat <UNK> <UNK> who sits around in a stupid looking cowboy suit listening to country music and eating too many <UNK> meanwhile a vaguely criminal guy named <UNK> played by the guy who owned the <UNK> in <UNK> gates of hell stumbles into joe <UNK> territory and shoots the sheriff in a poorly edited scene joe don slowly gives chase and offs <UNK> brother after <UNK> his now legendary catch phrase it's your move think you can take me well go ahead <UNK> for some reason joe don a texas <UNK> must transport <UNK> to italy mr <UNK> been a major source of embarrassment to the italian government ' says mr wilson another vague character played by bill <UNK> who was in master ninja 1 she freak and a lot of good clint eastwood movies br br <UNK> joe <UNK> plane must land on the island of <UNK> where <UNK> escapes with the help of a <UNK> and a guy who looks like jon <UNK> and that's where the movie <UNK> to a halt for the rest of the movie joe don looks for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ends up in a jail cell is <UNK> at by the <UNK> chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for <UNK> any more then joe don keeps looking for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ends up in a jail cell is <UNK> at by the <UNK> chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for <UNK> any more then joe don looks for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ends up in a jail cell is <UNK> at by the <UNK> chief of police and then is let go with a warning not to look for <UNK> any more this is one <UNK> movie br br at one point joe don is thought to be dead at sea all the other characters wonder if he's dead or not finally <UNK> that he is but then he shows up he was rescued by a poor family and no one mentions the fact that he was missing at sea for several days even his cute julia louise dreyfuss <UNK> sidekick doesn't welcome him back she does however offer to help him find <UNK> so joe don looks for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ends up in a jail cell is <UNK> at by the <UNK> chief of police and then let go with a warning not to look for <UNK> any more br br <UNK> include a bizarre carnival with strange colorful <UNK> some sexy <UNK> a shoot out involving a kid dressed like <UNK> and a <UNK> of tomatoes a chase scene involving a guy dressed like a monk and any scene without joe don <UNK> include joe don threatening a stripper with a coat <UNK> br br it should be noted that this is from <UNK> clark director of <UNK> revenge who appears as the sheriff <UNK> br br
<START> late one night on a desolate road in an empty saloon martin sheen <UNK> a yarn for robert carradine of <UNK> cassidy and friends tracking a group of murderous cattle <UNK> who've killed a few men and kidnapped <UNK> girl br br writer director christopher coppola may have <UNK> the wrath of william <UNK> <UNK> by daring to make a modern low budget film featuring their beloved <UNK> but i'm glad he did it no character should be so tied to an an actor that no one else ever be allowed to play him or her again br br i thought it was good fun and an interesting <UNK> of the classic <UNK> of the thirties and forties though guilty of some bad acting this is earnest enough and <UNK> making it hard for me to dislike br br the whole production is a bit odd though but i really enjoyed the scenes between sheen and <UNK> the fact that we're watching a story within a story makes the <UNK> and <UNK> more <UNK>
<START> lovely piece of good cinema this is one of those films that you see smiling and you do not know why well one of the reasons could be that we are before one of the most surprising directors today and he is able to film emotions br br when you are watching the film you can feel what mr straight was feeling when he took the decision to go to visit his brother with his marvellous john <UNK> what changed in his mind what changed in your mind when you watched this film br br a beautiful <UNK> love story
<START> had i checked imdb before renting this dvd from netflix i'd have a couple of hours of my life back i'm frankly suspicious when i see that a film's director also wrote it in this case according to the credits the same guy was <UNK> and director unfortunately an indication of the overall quality of this production there were a few interesting moments e g judy <UNK> scene reminded of her early comedy routines <UNK> judy <UNK> which led me to rate this two stars rather than one those moments however were few and far between and i almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me not to mention <UNK> in its violence i admit i went back to watch that part again to see if i had missed something that would help me figure it out once i'd seen the whole thing nope though i at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later the spinning camera technique was <UNK> and essentially pointless i found myself talking to the tv screen what or for goodness sake get on with it not recommended
<START> while the acting and directing could be <UNK> as having some merit the storyline is a very poor wannabe vietnam movie with the country name simply changed br br at the very least for a movie to hold some credibility try and have some semblance of accuracy in equipment weapons and tactics <UNK> the gross <UNK> of the behaviour of the troops as a norm br br aside for the limited use as silly propaganda about the south african <UNK> force it serves little purpose definitely no entertainment value br br aspiring movie makers this is how not to make a war movie do some research and have some pride in your product
<START> i sure would like to see a <UNK> of a up dated <UNK> series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me i grew up on black and white tv and <UNK> with <UNK> were my hero's every week you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure oh by the way thank you for an <UNK> like this to view many <UNK> about tv and the many movies so any <UNK> way i believe i've got what i wanna say would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt if my <UNK> would be 10 lines would you let me submit or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit if this is so then i must go so lets do it
<START> this show has a few clichés and a few over the top <UNK> creek like moments a 16 year old talking about way back when life made sense but overall it seems like a decent show most of the characters seem very real and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot ending with a good lesson in the end i just hope every episode doesn't turn out to be life <UNK> like the first that would just be too much drama for this vehicle jeremy <UNK> does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball i believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of
<START> although this film was made before <UNK> emerged as the <UNK> method of filmmaking and before digital <UNK> over strike that you get the point this 1991 masterpiece clearly anticipated those developments <UNK> <UNK> is just outstanding as the <UNK> do well author and narrator the pace is slow but <UNK> so because the cinematography is so beautiful record it the next time its on t v because i guarantee you'll never see a better nostalgia rip off made for t v movie direct to video never felt so good
<START> i recently watched this again and there's another version which is shorter 1999 i get the feeling they are the same movie but i would like to know the difference br br one is japanese and no <UNK> short is all i can come up with <UNK> why vote for the same movie twice br br <UNK> <UNK> was rather boring she sounded as if she was almost asleep no expression at all with the few lines she had br br this was enjoyable enough but there wasn't much to it at all br br a collector <UNK> after <UNK> he has no plan to destroy the world and the usual characters who try to stop him because trying to capture <UNK> causes a lot of destruction br br the pokemon movies that follow are slightly better <UNK> poke 7 is great with no 8 almost here
<START> oh boy god bless the 1970's we got some of the most horrific movies that came out of that decade the exorcist jaws the texas chainsaw massacre halloween and now <UNK> ann andy a musical adventure this movie must be used to torture captured terrorists into telling us about their evil plans to destroy the world i mean seriously this movie scared the heck out of me my sister had this movie in her vhs collection and i was kind of curious what kind of movie they would make out of a doll that came out of the great depression for kids with very little pocket money what the heck it's kinda funny how this movie is the 1970's version of toy story pretty much down to a key only this was a thousand times scarier disney had alice in wonderland to get into the drug <UNK> for the children br br whenever <UNK> leaves the room <UNK> ann along with her brother <UNK> andy and a whole <UNK> full of colorful toys come to life on <UNK> birthday a new doll <UNK> arrives from paris france to the united states of america <UNK> is a spoiled creature who is unaware she is a doll but the friendly <UNK> ann does everything she can to make <UNK> feel at home however the pirate captain <UNK> kidnaps her <UNK> ann and andy set off to try to rescue her before <UNK> discovers <UNK> is gone out in the world outside the <UNK> the two meet the <UNK> with the <UNK> knees a blue toy <UNK> who has been cast off by past owners and is now <UNK> and lonely after <UNK> ann and andy <UNK> a ride on the <UNK> he begins to follow his hallucinations and without looking runs over the edge of a cliff into a deep pit in this pit they encounter the greedy who is a giant <UNK> blob of <UNK> who eats constantly and is never full the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> escape being consumed by the greedy and continue their journey to find <UNK> and believe me it just gets <UNK> from this point on br br while this movie was certainly disturbing and i just wanted to cry and cover my eyes during a lot of the movie this was actually pretty creative back in the day when we had hand drawn animation that made films more personal and that the writers and animators put their heart into it you can tell that they did that with <UNK> ann andy a musical adventure this certainly wasn't the worst movie i have ever seen i just don't know who to recommend it too as scared as i was i have to admit i'm glad i watched it sometimes you need a wtf movie to spice up your selection believe me when i say that <UNK> ann had no problem in doing just that with me it's official that doll is just plain creepy let's just put it this way there's a giant <UNK> river that is eating everything a king who's head keeps getting bigger as he laughs a bizarre thing that <UNK> <UNK> ann and her brother a strange almost incest between ann and andy and a couple of naked dolls that will forever haunt my dreams with their songs <UNK> br br 7 10
<START> i'm a don johnson fan but this is undoubtedly the worst movie done by anybody that i've ever seen the acting was bad as was the cinematography don should stick to doing action because as the king he just didn't cut it
<START> this movie is similar to the play entitled <UNK> <UNK> written by <UNK> coward the plot of a ghost wife and a medium are strongly linked to <UNK> writing i'm surprised that movies of this nature don't acknowledge the original writer's concept i realize that the public may not be aware that this is a <UNK> but it is br br sad these movies are so expensive to produce i do <UNK> up when a screenplay is original i even <UNK> up when it's an innovative way to produce a work that was previously released there were some <UNK> mentioned such as <UNK> etc br br i realize that movies are still a <UNK> <UNK> form of entertainment however i'm not please when the <UNK> taste is taken for granted in this situation the <UNK> taste is overlooked br br i look forward to better produced movie entertainment br br in this case i rather see the play
<START> i borrowed slightly <UNK> title from some other comment i have to say that as i usually don't like relationship series i really did liked this one great characters interesting and not cliché story good acting good and again not cliché which in case of dialogs is rather rare dialogs it is really interesting how the characters cross paths with each other and sometimes <UNK> sometimes more or less at random influence each others lives but unfortunately as we say in our country do you know how do you recognize a good us series it is the one that got canceled before the end of the first season sure it isn't always true but
<START> as a study of the <UNK> of human nature in the context of old age this film is without parallel it is quite simply brilliant full marks to everyone from the scriptwriter to all involved in the finished product you can only marvel at the <UNK> inherent in the characterisation of the two <UNK> performers
<START> left behind is the kind of we know what we know cause we know it movie that christians and most any other naive person needs to help them feel like what they think and believe not know is right but at the same time i feel bad for the little guys because this is not a well made film it does not help any message i work at a video store and i know the only reason people went to see this movie was because they were religious and they thought it was anybody on this earth who thinks they know what will happen in the future is wrong unless they think they know that they don't know i've had about enough but only after i've had too much of these people walking around with their <UNK> in the air thinking that a movies starring a semi talented tv actor means something above me br br please if you love yourself you'll stay away i refuse to go into any detail about this movie not because a i didn't see it because i did b it was too shocking for my <UNK> self to handle because it wasn't or c i really don't have anything to say bad about it because i do the reason which is a word nobody who helped make this movie understands is that i want this movie out of my head i want that it was made out of my head i want that i watched all of it with an open mind out of my head i want the message that kirk so proudly and <UNK> gives at the end of the movie out of my head i only want all the things that were in my head before viewing this movies there anything directly connected with this movie that's floating in my head get out my peaceful rage is ending i'm sorry that somebody in this world went to the theater to see this movie about what could happen in the future but won't when they could have given that seven dollars plus to any number of human animal or rain forest charity but if they did that then they wouldn't be able to believe in the fact that it's real they might have to fact what is left behind zero out of
<START> aka <UNK> in the sun br br i have no idea what i just watched three men wander <UNK> and drink <UNK> about everything and at everyone in their path this is supposed to be a drama but what it is is a total waste of film without a single redeeming quality br br i have read reviews <UNK> the performances <UNK> as wonderful beautiful and heroic i'm afraid i cannot agree unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant <UNK> humans who ever walked br br all in all this was not a movie it wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience i've watched this three times and cannot for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage there is nothing profound here whatsoever it's crap br br it rates a zero 10 from br br the fiend
<START> as a child i preferred the first care bear movie since this one seemed so dark i always sat down and watched the first one as i got older i learned to prefer this one what i do think is that this film is too dark for <UNK> but as you get older you learn to treasure it since you understand it more it doesn't seem as dark as it was back when you were a child br br this movie in my opinion is better than the first one everything is so much deeper it may <UNK> the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one the <UNK> are just too adorable i <UNK> that <UNK> my <UNK> scene i tend to annoy everyone by singing it br br the sound track is great a big hand to carol and dean parks i love every song in this movie i have <UNK> them all and is all i am listening to i'm listening to <UNK> <UNK> also known as <UNK> at the moment i have always preferred this sound track to the first one although i just totally love carol kings song in the first movie <UNK> a <UNK> br br i think the animation is great the animation in both movies are fantastic i was surprised when i sat down and watched it about 10 years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent it was really surprising br br there is not a lot of back up from other people to say that this movie is great but it is i do not think it is weird strange i think it is a wonderful movie br br basically this movie is about how the care bears came about and to defeat the demon dark heart the end is surprising and again beats any <UNK> <UNK> with the care bears moral issues it leaves an effect on you again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality
<START> this is a very memorable spaghetti western it has a great storyline interesting characters and some very good acting especially from <UNK> <UNK> her role as the evil <UNK> in this film is truly classic she steals every scene she is in and expresses so much with her face and eyes even when she's not speaking her performance is very believable she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top not that there's anything wrong with being over the top mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too br br the music score is excellent and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie whether you want it to or not there are a couple of parts that are very amusing i especially like the part where <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in front of the parrot there's also lots of slick gun play that's very well done br br i would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things the first being a silly bar room <UNK> that occurs about 25 minutes into the film this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie it is very poorly choreographed and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight one might be able to overlook this if it were a <UNK> hill bud spencer comedy but this is a more serious western and the <UNK> really needed to be more realistic the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was <UNK> cowardly mexican sidekick i guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this and he wasn't at all funny all i can say is where is <UNK> when you need him br br all that having been said let me assure everyone reading this that johnny <UNK> is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults i have mentioned and all fans of the genre need to see this movie
<START> what starts out as a very predictable and somewhat drab affair is in the end quite hilarious and entertaining right to die is not very suspenseful but it more than makes up for that with some outlandish set pieces and over the top gore br br spoilers here br br top credits also go to the dead on performance from martin <UNK> as one of the most despicable characters ever to grace the screen playing the character in a great <UNK> fashion you nearly feel bad for the guy in the end when his grand plan ultimately fails corbin bernsen also <UNK> up the scenery playing a not so good guy who gets his just <UNK> br br end of spoiler br br as a revenge from the dead flick right to die benefits heavily from it's performers and is more than an ok way to spend less than an hour
<START> alex winter and keanu reeves return as the two <UNK> from san <UNK> who get sent on another trip of a lifetime as someone from the future feels exactly the opposite the way it was presented in the first movie br br the only difference is that their trip is somewhere between heaven and hell and ends up being both when they meet the grim <UNK> they get the chance of an after lifetime to play him for a chance to return and stop two evil robots from ruining what future they were supposed to have besides playing roles they have er <UNK> they also play and revive a couple of extra sales in the process some classic games i even have my original copy of <UNK> in the closet br br the reason i liked this movie better than the original is because it deals with what it might be like instead of what was without spoiling the movie i can't give you anymore information about this i guess you'll just have to watch them both and decide for yourself 8 out of 10 stars
<START> saw this saturday night at the <UNK> film festival and it's a stick to your bones movie it's really stayed with me adapted very <UNK> from what is probably an excellent novel it's a back and forth in time drama with fully rounded characters thoughtful <UNK> on life choices and i'm not <UNK> one of the greatest casts ever assembled in 100 years of movie making wonderful work from everyone led by a <UNK> vanessa redgrave as a dying <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and claire danes as her much younger self meryl <UNK> daughter <UNK> <UNK> is like mama the real deal patrick wilson looks like paul newman circa 1958 and doesn't <UNK> the charm and what a pleasure to see such excellent stage actors as barry <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sharp detailed cameos hugh <UNK> also from the stage doesn't bring much edge to the somewhat clichéd role of an unhappy rich <UNK> and the family issues are resolved perhaps more neatly than real life would allow but it's a deliberately paced visually gorgeous <UNK> on real life issues and you can cry at it and not feel like you're being <UNK> manipulated also what a <UNK> parade of 1940s 50s <UNK>
<START> i was surprised that <UNK> secret <UNK> was an enjoyable good film probably because i didn't have any expectations for this movie though the film does have it's plot holes i would say that you couldn't guess who was behind the whole scheme until the very end of the movie at first i thought it was robert ryan using the same method like <UNK> where husband tries to drive his wife mad but i was wrong the main problem with the movie is they drive at a whole other direction which gave no clues at the beginning i thought robert ryan <UNK> <UNK> carried their parts well plus vivian vance a fine character actress who steals scenes in this one those who like movies that keeps you guessing will like this one
<START> this is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever and may be one of the best movies ever it's got a great plot that functions like a puzzle with lots of intrigue and suspense this film is full of cat and mouse games and <UNK> with people hiding their identities and their <UNK> the characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters they are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their <UNK> and desires br br the fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting it has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy there are 5 members of the poison clan each one with his own style that <UNK> the special skill of a <UNK> animal the styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film when this happens the director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel these cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely br br one thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death the director chang <UNK> was obviously very concerned that the film not <UNK> death this makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective we actually care when people are killed in this film this is because the camera <UNK> on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching when characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain br br at the same time this is also a fun movie it has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film there is bad dubbing the characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic all this just adds to the greatness of the film br br and lets not forget that this director was a visual <UNK> much more gifted than most of his <UNK> if you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical <UNK> on display is <UNK> everything goes by so fast because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is the lighting and composition are spectacular at times the camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing in the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example imagine hitchcock moving at about twice the speed chang <UNK> was truly a master <UNK> and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it's confines he doesn't <UNK> the boat of the kung fu genre film but in a subtle way his skills <UNK> every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work he is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people br br this is the real package a kung fu movie that delivers on every level it's art it's trash it's emotionally moving and it's fun it has a true sense of morality but doesn't allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action i recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not
<START> i remember this movie quite intense for an 11 year old good editing i felt terrible for the st bernard i'd watch it again if it were <UNK> but the <UNK> is passing <UNK> as i write this robert <UNK> a highlight of his career i am just glad i didn't live in that neighborhood oh those 70's what a decade if they remade it i bet it would be very violent and bloody so what are they waiting for an excellent movie for pre <UNK> suburban boys it was very intense i think it was filmed in los angeles certainly not made in <UNK> <UNK> the shot with the st bernard was the best and obviously the most haunting image from the film and then they left the <UNK> on the <UNK> rotten kids
<START> i've tried to watch this show several times but for a show called that '70s show i don't find much apart from a few <UNK> and the occasional reference to disco that actually evokes the '70s the decade in which i grew up of the episodes i have seen most of the plots and jokes could be set in any time period take away the novelty of supposedly being set in the '70s and the show is neither interesting nor funny br br if you're looking for a show that more successfully represents the experience of youth in america in the '70s in my humble opinion you can do no better than the wonder years
<START> the king maker will <UNK> be a success in thailand where the similar but superior 'the legend of <UNK> set box office records the film directed by <UNK> <UNK> after a screenplay by sean <UNK> based on historical fact in <UNK> <UNK> has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is <UNK> by one of the <UNK> pedestrian scripts and story development on film br br the event the picture relates is the arrival of the portuguese soldier of fortune <UNK> de <UNK> gary stretch whose vengeance for this father's murderer drives him to <UNK> captured and thrown into slavery and put on the <UNK> in <UNK> in the kingdom of <UNK> where he is purchased by the beautiful maria cindy <UNK> with the <UNK> of her father <UNK> john rhys davies a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses there is a plot to <UNK> the king and <UNK> and his new <UNK> sidekick <UNK> dom <UNK> after some gratuitous cgi enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness are first rewarded by the king to become his <UNK> only to be imprisoned together once queen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover lord <UNK> oliver <UNK> to take over the rule of <UNK> yet of course <UNK> and <UNK> escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families <UNK> wife and children and <UNK> now firm love affair with maria with the expected consequences br br the acting with the exception of john rhys davies is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp the <UNK> <UNK> cast struggle with the poorly written dialog making us wish they had used their native <UNK> with subtitles the musical score by ian <UNK> sounds as though <UNK> form old tv soap operas but if it is visual <UNK> you're after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching it is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions it is just the <UNK> that are missing grady <UNK>
<START> one of the best comedy series to ever come out of britain mark <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and steve <UNK> are terrific actors and performers who seem at home with drama as they are with comedy <UNK> supported by their writing partner jeremy <UNK> they have <UNK> the series with the most memorable characters of recent years little britain <UNK> into <UNK> as a poor imitation of their ideas consistently original and groundbreaking i am sure that as many people hate these series as love them but i am equally as sure that no one could have no opinion on <UNK> i have yet to see the feature length movie but i have heard good things and bad things so i will <UNK> judgement the original radio series from which <UNK> came was as innovative as the tv series became i don't know whether the tv series made it to the us but i would be fascinated to see how american audiences found the weird <UNK> of the humour
<START> my friends and i rented that movie last night and we had one of the greatest laughs in awhile the movie is not supposed to be funny at all but it is just so ridiculous and it lacks any realism whatsoever first <UNK> i forget what his character is called and i don't really care uses his regular employee id to go through all the top security <UNK> not only is that pathetic but it gets topped when his enormous efforts <UNK> in his finding the so scary <UNK> room which <UNK> the super computers this is plain funny the tense mood that we are supposed to experience is completely <UNK> by the childish looking room the ending like all else is very very very cheesy especially when the bad guy's lawyer shows up <UNK> on <UNK> anyway this movie is a good laugh if you need something to make fun of definitely see it
<START> ok here is how i do this i grade movies on 10 <UNK> each <UNK> will <UNK> start with 5 points it can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0 br br mood action romance comedy drama suspense i give this <UNK> 10 points it had a perfect balance of all five aspects the action was fun and <UNK> the romance was not overdone but still very emotional and moving i laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still i was captivated by the fantastic drama and riveting suspense br br plot i give this <UNK> 10 points i thought all the good fairy tales had already been told i found my self sitting in the theatre returned to my childhood and in that instant i again believed in <UNK> wicked witches and falling stars that make dreams come true br br cinema photography i give this <UNK> 8 points while the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles i found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camera br br fx i give this <UNK> 10 points i love that they used c g i <UNK> the epic scenes were believable the magical powers were <UNK> realistic all in all less is more and this had it all cast i give this <UNK> 10 points no names and seasoned actors alike the cast was amazing michelle pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked charlie cox made <UNK> come to life claire danes gave emotion to the stars and i will never look and robert de niro the same again br br acting i give this <UNK> 10 points even the <UNK> actors played their rolls to perfection once again i will never look and robert de niro the same again br br character development i give this <UNK> 9 points this felt a little rushed and i think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice br br dialogue i give this <UNK> 10 points the dialogue was smart witty <UNK> even the <UNK> had good dialogue br br score i give this <UNK> 7 points i can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie i am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable br br ending i give this <UNK> 9 points almost perfect ending i feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more <UNK> while others could have been more subdued but no threads were left <UNK> br br total <UNK> buy the dvd <UNK> yes see it in the theatre most definitely bottom line excellent movie for everyone epic i strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre i know i'll be going back for seconds
<START> terrible film made on a budget of about 9 99 very obvious <UNK> sets used poor acting and an awful storyline concerning aliens who use <UNK> meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship the film contains some blood not enough to <UNK> and a character with an <UNK> replacing one of his hands yes you read that correctly br br one saving grace was a song performed at the talent show <UNK> that for irony by a punk new wave band that i think was called i'm a heat seeking missile other than that this is not worth your time not even on a so bad it's good level watch if you are into cheesy alien films but anyone else should steer clear br br rating 1 out of 10
<START> this was playing at our theater in <UNK> and the film we wanted to see was sold out so we went to this not knowing anything about it other than it was a documentary about the planet we were very happy at our misfortune as this was a very powerful film about life and the delicate balance we all share with the rest of the inhabitants of earth this film has some of the most breathtaking photography i have ever seen in a film and took me places from <UNK> to <UNK> to rain <UNK> and displayed things i have never seen in a film tv or book earth is a film that every student should see before they become jaded i will encourage my niece to see this film since she will be <UNK> the planet we leave her this is also a film to see on a theater screen or a very big television since the photography is so powerful and exotic
<START> one star for the plot one star for the acting one star for the dubbing into <UNK> voiced american five stars for monica <UNK> and <UNK> maria <UNK> with their <UNK> for taking all their clothes off and ten out of ten for the divine <UNK> <UNK> two years before she made <UNK> des <UNK> <UNK> also <UNK> a couple of times but even fully <UNK> her presence is enough to make this film <UNK> watchable watch out for the scene where she tells her friend about the three first times for a girl it's corny but still far more erotic than the rather laughably choreographed love scenes featuring <UNK> <UNK> and patrick <UNK> incidentally the cinematography is not great the stills for the closing credits are a better indication of what david hamilton is capable of
<START> notable because of it's notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> takes her young <UNK> penis from his <UNK> and into her mouth even without this moment the film is a splendid if slightly disturbing passionate and <UNK> sexy ride <UNK> puts in a great performance as the partly deranged <UNK> delight wandering about her flat nude dressed partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love sexual passion philosophy and politics for me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fiancé is released whilst fellow terrorists are released she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his <UNK> than anything else as she <UNK> beautifully of course
<START> this is seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen i love japanese movies and i think another film by the same director electric dragon 80 000 v is a masterpiece i really wanted to like this movie <UNK> is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing but i couldn't find anything entertaining about it br br the movie takes forever for nothing to happen and the effects the director used like the constant <UNK> and the <UNK> use of slow motion merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind <UNK> slow and the actors were <UNK> overacting a lot of the boredom was a result of <UNK> <UNK> that were completely unnecessary like an hour spent on <UNK> going around <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> how he doesn't worship anything this added nothing to the plot a fellow japanese film buff and i were both checking the time constantly we couldn't believe this film was as terrible as it was and the finale was awful i thought the director would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this but sadly i was mistaken
<START> following directly from where the story left off in part one the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such in direct contrast to the first feature part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a <UNK> country to <UNK> <UNK> of a country to which he has no previous ties the change of setting isn't just aesthetic from the <UNK> and spring <UNK> of the <UNK> comes a change of tone and heart to the feature replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical <UNK> and <UNK> reality <UNK> to an all new struggle yet as che would go on to say <UNK> a struggle is best told exactly as <UNK> struggle while part one certainly helped document that initial <UNK> to power that the revolutionary <UNK> acquired through just that part two takes a much more <UNK> <UNK> and bleak segment of che's life and ambition and gives it an <UNK> portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a <UNK> easy to grasp manner br br while the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and <UNK> quite drastically from part one however there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and <UNK> as much as possible this somewhat distant cold approach to telling che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off indeed i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one <UNK> anything the entirety of che taken as a whole delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way by no means does soderbergh try to paint a <UNK> portrait here akin to what <UNK> did with der <UNK> half a decade ago excuse the ironic contrast che is a slow moving reserved and <UNK> approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who <UNK> <UNK> the whole thing br br yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and <UNK> to the bleak <UNK> backdrop of bolivia for part two the story does inevitably take on a distinctly <UNK> tone that doesn't feel too disjointed from its predecessor but does enough to give it its own reference points here the basic structure of part one is <UNK> <UNK> the initial struggle the battles the fallen <UNK> and the <UNK> of those to replace them all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement yet as anyone with the <UNK> idea of the actual history behind the feature will know part two is destined to end on a much more <UNK> and <UNK> note this difference in combination with the similarities to part one make a compelling and memorable whole by all means both could be <UNK> one their own and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such and enjoyed as they are but taken as one statement che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve br br indeed everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building realistically structured combat <UNK> drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and <UNK> but with a feature such as this part two once again proves that avoiding such elements don't necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged in fact upon writing this review i was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one and title the review as a whole yet i felt that to do so would only serve to <UNK> those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films <UNK> br br with that said i cannot rightfully <UNK> whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its <UNK> four hour plus runtime but upon viewing both segments i can at least <UNK> to each <UNK> ability to do just that with a <UNK> intricate screenplay combined with endlessly <UNK> photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie's characters without drawing attention to themselves che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor but this time with a tragic but uplifting <UNK> conclusion fit for the history pages of film br br a review by jamie robert ward http www <UNK> net
<START> well if it weren't for <UNK> waters and a 7 year old sammy davis jr here billed without the jr <UNK> jones for president would be one of the worst <UNK> of african american stereotypes i've seen from the early <UNK> era and wouldn't have been worth seeing because of that ms waters is excellent here singing am i blue and underneath our harlem moon while mr davis shows us how his childhood experience in <UNK> prepared him for his superstar status as an adult he's so good tap dancing here that for awhile i thought he was a little person with decades of experience so if you're willing to ignore the negative <UNK> here <UNK> jones for president should provide some good enjoyment p s this marks the fourth time today i've seen and heard the song i'll be glad when you're dead you <UNK> you performed on film this time by davis must have been a very popular song about this time
<START> well you take o j simpson as a all american soldier turned all american bus driver who decides to rescue his passengers on his own just <UNK> no one else is going to and <UNK> johnson in an absolutely straight role as the tour guide who doesn't know what to do but doesn't want to admit they are in trouble and combine it with <UNK> lamas as one of three baby faced bad boys who intend to kidnap an <UNK> and leave a <UNK> of people to die on the <UNK> and you have got to have action plot twists and a lot of drama everyone was good but seeing lamas as the <UNK> of the bad boys really blew my mind he was much too believable as the overbearing bad guy who not only wanted to kidnap the <UNK> but rape the women and <UNK> the guy who tried to stop him this was evidently long before he <UNK> his good guy image and believe me a 20 year old <UNK> in tight <UNK> you really don't want to miss
<START> this is one of those films that i could only sit through once charlotte henry is fine in fact all the actors were fine the problem was in the script the dialog the direction the editing the sets and the special effects granted this was 1933 but it really <UNK> part of the problem is that actors like richard <UNK> gary cooper w c fields and cary grant are not recognizable there faces cried for a recognition that was not <UNK> the movie just <UNK> along with no <UNK> much of lewis <UNK> spirit humor and continuity are missing what a pity it's such a great book i would recommend disney's 1951 version
<START> it has been almost 5 years since the release of this stylish action flick i have watched this movie almost 10 times and it a great effort by <UNK> from my perspective i feel this movie is virtually flawless <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> no doubt classy <UNK> played her role as <UNK> very well the character suits her very well the character that caught movie goers attention was <UNK> <UNK> played the role of <UNK> very well brutal and <UNK> <UNK> deservedly received the best villain award in the <UNK> 2004 the supporting cast of daniel <UNK> <UNK> and other performed well br br <UNK> screenplay perfectly timed dialogues and brilliant narration by <UNK> the soundtrack by harris <UNK> are all <UNK> <UNK> while the <UNK> suits the movie very well cinematography by r d <UNK> is rich peter <UNK> choreographed the stunts well <UNK> editing is precise above all <UNK> <UNK> is a perfect cop film filled with right doses of action and romance br br even some hollywood film cant compete with <UNK> <UNK> undoubtedly
<START> this movie contains personalities that so deliciously are playing their parts i love the final when nobody knows what are they gonna do about their life but it's completely great when you see and realize that the priest is right is <UNK> for two so what are the other persons doing there the movie embrace you to a new life to experiences to be able of dream with the other person and reach those dreams also shows you the life itself hard like it is but gives you the option to choose what you want and what you really need hope this comment works for you the movie it did worked well for me i bought the movie by the way take care
<START> this film has some of the greatest comedic dialog and memorable quotes ever assembled in one film the plot is somewhat lacking but the delightful <UNK> are enough to make up the difference this is a timeless movie for all ages that is sure to please as a cinematic art form it is highly entertaining and with major stars like cary grant myrna loy and melvyn douglas how could you go wrong br br comedic dialog and <UNK> such as this has long been <UNK> and is very difficult to imitate a good example of this is seen in the 1986 <UNK> of this film the money pit with tom hanks and shelley long despite the talent and physical comedy of these stars the film dragged and received poor reviews and viewer comments achieving true comedic dialog is an art
<START> and you can look at that statement in different ways by the way first of all it's a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes your <UNK> imagination doesn't even come close to some of the <UNK> shown scenes here entire parts of this movie are just plain sick disgusting offensive brutal and they bring you close to <UNK> your guts out now i love horror movies and i am very <UNK> <UNK> but i do think that it has to lead somewhere is that too much to ask cradle of fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts the movie contains out of four separate chapters connected by a <UNK> story this results in endless showing of torture murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common not very informative if you ask me and yet it has to be said the basic plot idea surely has potential it's about a <UNK> <UNK> who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial personally i think that is an interesting topic so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever br br secondly the whole production of this movie was a mess they didn't have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts tons of it the acting performances are a joke and some of the worst i've ever seen any other special effects besides the make up looks very amateurish like that attempt to a realistic car crash for example there's no tension or atmosphere to <UNK> anywhere not even an attempt to build up one br br cradle of fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least with the presence of death metal icon <UNK> filth from the band cradle of filth get the link this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this and then people keep complaining that the amount of <UNK> and juvenile <UNK> is increasing <UNK> i can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you're easily influenced or <UNK> of an unstable mind for every self <UNK> horror fan this movie is an insult
<START> i have seen <UNK> and also <UNK> disco godfather two other fine works of the <UNK> <UNK> from our friend <UNK> ray moore but this film the human <UNK> aka <UNK> 2 will always hold a special place in my heart for sheer <UNK> lack of skill in film production and absolute enthusiasm frankly a little too much the human <UNK> cannot be topped br br the opening scene sets the tone our old pal <UNK> is <UNK> up with a white woman when some racist local cops raid the house for no good reason and wouldn't you know it the woman in bed with ol' <UNK> is none other than the <UNK> wife her cry when she sees him he made me do it <UNK> cry are you for real subtlety was never his strong point br br highlights the cameo by a very young ernie hudson of <UNK> fame the continuity errors characters looking one way in one shot and another in the next <UNK> suit changing colors in every single shot of his nightclub act and queen <UNK> demonic eyes in her first scene br br but the real joy here is <UNK> ray moore himself did the man really think he looked cool in this movie i certainly don't know why but you have to admire the sheer enthusiasm he has whether it be jumping totally naked off a cliff or <UNK> orders to his gang in rhyme e g quick into the cave i have a plan to let that mother dig his own grave the man commits totally certainly he goes overboard <UNK> so than any time he's doing kung fu the climactic battle is filmed at high speed but <UNK> slows down to let <UNK> pose and <UNK> his teeth i'm not sure if they wanted it too look like they <UNK> up the film as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe he was that fast in any event the matrix it is not br br human <UNK> much like the original <UNK> is an incompetent film of enormous proportions but at least it's fun and certainly you have to give credit to these people for the effort just not that much enjoy with my <UNK> <UNK>
<START> just as tom berenger put you into the soul of sgt barnes he has done it again with thomas <UNK> if i thought his world was <UNK> in on him in the first scenes it was nothing compared to how much more i felt during the last scenes great movie even for a girl
