<START> bela lugosi <UNK> in his role as european <UNK> <UNK> dr <UNK> in this outlandish tale of horror and <UNK> the good doctor's aging wife needs <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> of young <UNK> in order to retain her youth and beauty what better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their <UNK> <UNK> them into a coma like state he brings them to his mansion to collect his <UNK> bounty according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis that brief description is much more entertaining and imaginative than the movie br br the corpse <UNK> 1942 wallace fox bela lugosi <UNK> <UNK> elizabeth russell
<START> wow i have seen so many bad low budget films lately but this one is great the very realistic portrayal of police life in a city on the east german coast is a strong contrast to other crime movies or series i loved the main actress and the absolute <UNK> of any prevalent clich√© about the police this film is realistic like a <UNK> and entertaining like a drama at the same time a perfect <UNK>
<START> first of all i thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by preston <UNK> <UNK> was one of the better hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired however it wasn't the preston <UNK> it was preston <UNK> jr the story was essentially based on robert louis <UNK> short story the bottle <UNK> a good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell that's fine nobody said screenwriters had to be original the actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen my biggest complaint comes with the ending the hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person at first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film they feel they have to provide one last <UNK> of horror at the very end of the film this is a stupid convention the older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end there is nothing wrong with good <UNK> over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think you can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end in fact i think it's <UNK>
<START> this film was one of the worst i've seen in a long while br br it's a combination police drama and comedy about two hollywood detectives harrison ford and josh <UNK> investigating a shootout at a hip hop club br br the plot is contrived and there are way too many side issues going on ford is <UNK> real estate on the side martin <UNK> is one of his <UNK> <UNK> runs a <UNK> school where he's <UNK> chicks in his spare time the two are under investigation by internal affairs ford is <UNK> the ex girlfriend lena <UNK> of the <UNK> investigator and she's a psychic who has a radio show the man who set up the killing at the club is a dirty ex cop who shot <UNK> father years ago br br toss in the obligatory car chases and some lame attempts at humor and that's about the <UNK> of this turkey
<START> any film which begins with a <UNK> <UNK> a female <UNK> can't promise much as for the stereotyping of the <UNK> as it was 50 <UNK> ago well i was there and it just wasn't like that ok every <UNK> had just a small piece of something shown in the film like youngsters <UNK> the kitchen at night but you can't show the whole <UNK> as being full of all those shall we say naughty traits each <UNK> had its own problems but hardly any <UNK> had all of them the views of israel were great i still remember my youth in that garden of <UNK> called the <UNK> valley yes and the acting was good too so you see it wasn't all black just a wrong portrayal probably on purpose too
<START> i didn't even want to watch this movie after reading <UNK> review and 1 1 2 star rating i watched it anyway on the advice of my son and found it much better than i expected i would give it 2 1 2 stars out of a 4 star system you have to watch the movie more than once to understand it all if you don't know much about religion you will miss a lot i <UNK> from high school the year the movie was made so maybe i can relate to it better yes there is some <UNK> in the movie and it's weird to some extent but that was the 70s so what do you expect i can see why people might not like the movie however i cannot understand people saying it is boring the movie is anything but boring you will either hate it or love it if you find it boring you are probably brain dead
<START> this film is more about how children make sense of the world around them and how they and we use myth to make sense of it all i think it's been <UNK> everyone going in expecting a <UNK> won't enjoy it but if you want a deeper story it's here
<START> i couldn't believe the comments made about the movie br br as i read the awful opinions about the movie i actually wondered if you had actually viewed the same movie that i did br br what i viewed was incredible i think the actresses and director did a fantastic job in the movie br br i hadn't had the pleasure to see either actress previously and i couldn't have been more set back by the incredible job that they did i'd have to say its the most believable movie that i've seen in a long time br br what i don't see is why everyone has such a problem with <UNK> choice of drug in the attempt of suicide scene from the comments made you sound like it was the actresses choice and her stupid choice that i don't understand its a movie written by someone else and directed by someone else so how it can be the actresses error i fail to see i think it was a real believable movie that i would see again and recommend opinions are what the are and its too bad that so many are so close minded i hope to see any of the actors soon i think that all played great roles br br busy <UNK> will be the highest paid actress someday and i hope she can laugh in the face of everyone that criticized her you go girl
<START> peter sellers one of my favorite actors is mildly amusing in this 1970 turkey but the script is so lame and insulting that even goldie <UNK> youth just after her oscar win cannot begin to pull this one out of the mud as a <UNK> chasing <UNK> in his 40's sellers mostly <UNK> himself to the <UNK> degree br br a 3 out of 10 best performance <UNK> <UNK> plays a young study type br br i hope hawn and sellers were paid well because i see no other reason for tripe like this in 1970 a very good year for films catch 22 m a s h husbands joe <UNK> five easy pieces and many others you can't win them all
<START> yeah <UNK> character whilst talking to the woman from the tv station is right the <UNK> is a corrupt violent and racist police and this movie changes nothing about it okay here are the good cops the moral cops even a black one <UNK> a christian a <UNK> but this is a fairy tale admit it reality is not like that and most important for the action fans the shoot out is boring it's just shooting and shooting and shooting nothing more play counter strike then you will at least have something to do the only moral of this film is the <UNK> is good now no more bad cops in it if you like <UNK> <UNK> commercials for police and military service watch this movie it's the longest commercial i've ever seen 2 points for camera and editing
<START> an overlong but compelling retelling of the friendship between civil rights leader steve biko and donald woods the first half of the film is the strongest where we see the bond formed between the two men and how they help each other out but the second half isn't as strong due to the <UNK> of the biko character still its a compelling film with great performances by kline and washington in the film that put the latter on the map washington was also was nominated for best supporting actor for the first time overall a well made film that could have been <UNK> down a bit 7 10
<START> funny how a studio thinks it can make a sequel to what was a classic christmas story with an entirely new cast and expect it to <UNK> sure they used various actors for batman but in that instance batman was a classic character before any of the actor <UNK> his cape in this instance you had a classic character in the blond headed horn <UNK> glasses wearing <UNK> that wanted a red <UNK> <UNK> gun for christmas somehow we are supposed to forget him and accept another little boy that share no resemblance to the original if i had not known it was a sequel i wouldn't have guessed it from the cast except of course charles <UNK> tries so hard to imitate <UNK> <UNK> that your are constantly reminded that the original was far better br br in the end it might have work if they had cast the movie better they should have looked for look a likes or simply ignored the original and not tried to copy its look and feel this one is just a cheap imitation the <UNK> evokes no sympathy just a desire to seem his character shoot his eye out or die
<START> <UNK> comedy has i r s agent tony randall investigating eccentric farm family in <UNK> who have never paid their <UNK> debbie reynolds is the <UNK> <UNK> daughter who puts the squeeze on the not so <UNK> tax man debbie certainly made her share of inferior theatrical sitcoms during this period and this one's no better or worse than the rest picture begins <UNK> but <UNK> at the halfway point becoming frantic and witless randall isn't a bad match for reynolds but the vehicle itself <UNK> the chemistry based on the novel the darling <UNK> of may by h e bates with a poor sound mix causing all the actors to sound as if they're stuck in an echo chamber from
<START> note to previous reviewer this movie is science fiction adaptation of the <UNK> according to the screenwriter so whether the references are painful or not no apologies it is the basis for the film they admit they stole though adapted is the p c term br br great flick but too short probably didn't come out as well as the author director or studio wanted but pretty damn fun the fact that the studio itself <UNK> during the making only helps add to its legacy br br a big budget remake wouldn't be as fun and probably wouldn't do the screenplay any more justice but it's fun to dream about the potential there a dvd release with some <UNK> extras is apparently available but i don't think it would play on <UNK> players i'm no expert and thus still trying to figure this out for now i live with the vhs incarnation
<START> this video guide was the masterpiece of the year 1995 beautifully done matthew perry and jennifer aniston have major on screen chemistry when they talk about what the start button does i'm waiting for <UNK> to release a special edition dvd complete with deleted scenes bill gates commentary a documentary of how windows 95 <UNK> to windows <UNK> and more br br overall 10 10 should have won at least a golden globe
<START> this film is awful not offensive but extremely predictable the movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid 60's the father the principal at the school is going through a mid life crisis enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her <UNK> minds with some thought provoking stuff like think for yourself the principal doesn't agree with her teaching but she is pretty you can connect the <UNK> his teenage daughter <UNK> <UNK> wannabe tara <UNK> is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live she gets some bad advice hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn't being taught at her school shocking seeing that director paul <UNK> has mainly worked in tv this movie plays like a more adult version of an after school special or a very special episode of one of the more mundane sitcoms
<START> the invisible ray is an excellent display of both the acting talents of boris karloff and bela lugosi karloff pulls off a flawless performance as a <UNK> and conflicted scientist who appears to put his scientific achievements ahead of his relationships with others even his wife his already loner personality becomes unbearable as he becomes paranoid br br lugosi plays the <UNK> professional who is passionate about his work but still finds time to maintain on good terms with everyone but still seems to have no real close friends this was one of his few roles as a good guy and he plays it very well it is hard however to hear his accent and believe he is french br br the biggest problem with the movie was that it was all based on junk science but in a way even the junk science makes it work well since the ideas and theories are completely idiotic they are as relevant today as they were when the movie was made and they are also as forward reaching and always will be br br this is a perfectly delightful movie to watch again and again i saw it maybe 5 times this weekend and i could easily sit through it five more times the acting is marvelous and the science is amusing i highly recommend it
<START> well this was not a surprise many people will tell you this is gory but they are all talking <UNK> this film is very slow br br it starts off with some guy who makes a <UNK> to feel no pain he calls it my son there is some gory scenes but i found them kind of weak you might as well skip 40 minutes of the movie and get to the <UNK> scene which was surprisingly impressive and sickening there is some really stupid scenes in this and they dub over the hits and <UNK> with stupid fake <UNK> sound which makes me laugh i would not recommend it keep looking gore <UNK> br br check this out if you want the like 20 10 minute ending scene which still is not that amazing and has a random scene of the guy trying to like rape his mum yeah its weird
<START> a wonder one of the best musicals ever the three busby <UNK> numbers that end the movie are spectacular but what makes this film so wonderful is the incredible non stop <UNK> and the natural acting of cagney and blondell keeler is also lovely even though she may not have been a great actress there's a <UNK> in the movie that you don't see in flicks today much less in the usually stilted 30s films even though the plot involving the setting up of movies <UNK> is quite dated
<START> this film is excellently paced you never have to wait for a belly laugh to come up for more than about a minute and there's much more going on than the initial premise of the film throughout it there are <UNK> of the traditional <UNK> local boys done good <UNK> <UNK> genre of which this parodies don't let anyone tell you that they're trying to get cheap laughs just by using <UNK> sure there's plenty of that but it's all <UNK> not gratuitous i loved this film and it only cost me <UNK> 99 on dvd so in terms of entertainment value for money it has been the best film i've seen this year
<START> a strangely enjoyable effort combining an appropriately far fetched plot involving adam and burt and flashbacks to the original tv series most of the flashback scenes were lifted directly from burt <UNK> book boy wonder my life in <UNK> and i imagine his book was the inspiration for making this movie like the book it left fans of the original series <UNK> for more br br if you missed this broadcast it is definitely worth the effort to borrow a tape from a friend who may have recorded it i'm making a copy for my kids right now
<START> <UNK> <UNK> this film really surprised me as it is a comedy masterpiece billy zane is stunning as the central character and everyone manages to play it straight enough for the comedy to be natural and easy br br the soundtrack is really good and the set pieces are a joy to behold i recommend that you watch this film with a bunch of mates a few <UNK> of your <UNK> of choice and prepare to be <UNK> and highly entertained br br this carries on so perfectly from <UNK> masterpieces like plan 9 from outer space that it is in the true b movie tradition but what makes it more than that is the caliber of the people who took part in the film ron <UNK> for example i still find my self <UNK> at the scene where zane <UNK> down a set of steps for no apparent reason in an almost ballet style all a bit mad and all the better for it
<START> i really liked this movie it was good and the actors were brilliant leon robinson who played richard and many other classic singers is very good at his job when you see him in a musical movie you know that it is going to be good i would suggest that people watch this heart warming sad and special movie if they want to know more about richard outstanding fresh
<START> i almost never comment on movies but i saw the 5 glowing reviews of this movie and decided i had to <UNK> in with my own review an <UNK> of mine received this film in the mail mixed in with his academy <UNK> <UNK> aka the guys who vote on the oscars and was so <UNK> with how terribly constructed this movie was that he brought it in to our class to demonstrate to us how not to put together a movie br br this film has no plot the scenes are horribly horribly edited <UNK> using faux 24 style picture in picture techniques and the performances particularly the lead who even fails at acting like a bad actress are for the most part obnoxious someone truly failed to understand the point of an introduction namely the setting up of the plot there is no setup halfway through the movie neither myself nor the rest of the class knew what this movie was supposed to be about the opening <UNK> shot which sets up some kind of murder is never addressed and now that i think about it was possibly meant to be a flash forward with the rest of the film being a flashback but it cuts from that scene directly to the next without any indication as such br br <UNK> i could really go on and on at the very least this movie gives me <UNK> confidence in my own film making ability
<START> one of the <UNK> of picking up the recent bela lugosi collection is getting to see delightful movies like the invisible ray boris karloff and bela lugosi team up in a movie that <UNK> into <UNK> and radiation and while the science is all perfectly absurd especially the camera technique karloff as <UNK> rukh uses to determine the site of a certain <UNK> and downright laughable i didn't care in the <UNK> because the movie is thoroughly enjoyable the effects are done well for the time the acting is great and the finish is particularly strong it reminds me of the pulp sci fi comics and novels of the 1940s and <UNK> complete with ray guns and ridiculous science you must watch this movie
<START> when a film is independent and not rated such as the <UNK> i was expecting out of the norm cut out your heart violence i know that good movies don't always contain blood and violence but i read reviews i visited the website and i even convinced a few of my friends to pay 9 50 to see this god awful movie with me when there is a festival called <UNK> i am expecting horror not <UNK> creek with incestuous undertones my expectations were extremely low for this film yet the little expectations there was for the film were shot to hell once i saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood come out of <UNK> finger there were too many plot holes and left too much to the imagination i regret not seeing happy feet i think there might have been more violence and gore in that movie than in the <UNK>
<START> the often misunderstood zabriskie point is <UNK> political film <UNK> american film <UNK> it follows suit after blow up meaning that the pace is faster than the previous epics though certainly no less <UNK> br br basically the common mistake is that the film <UNK> the hippie generation not so br br the two protagonists come from vastly different <UNK> mark from the rebel <UNK> daria from an estate agency corporation but in true antonioni fashion they are both <UNK> both trying to escape their surroundings mark leaves a meeting of rebel students and black <UNK> disappointed with the <UNK> empty <UNK> while daria keeps <UNK> being on the move with her car br br <UNK> the master director after portraying the <UNK> youth as confused and shallow then moves to the city an environment <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that has to keep <UNK> to <UNK> the similar <UNK> of the population <UNK> a profit at the same time it is this environment that the two protagonists escape from though it seems mostly out of coincidence br br indeed when daria stops by a small village in the <UNK> of the desert the environment is just as <UNK> and the people just as lost cases best <UNK> by an old boxing champion now reduced to a shadow of himself sitting around drinking and smoking and talking nonsense a stunning melancholy sequence made even more powerful with the inclusion of some half wild children living around brought in by some <UNK> but destroying a genuine piece of american history in a not so obscure symbolism there is <UNK> opinion on the hippies just a half positive glimpse in the <UNK> of human alienation br br and then there is the desert the landscape used to devastating effect by turns pure and terrifying <UNK> wild and dead the sequence where the two protagonists make love joined in fantasy by the flower generation reflects the similar sequence in red desert where <UNK> tells her son a story it is a colourful <UNK> in a <UNK> landscape a vivid half fantasy in a <UNK> reality br br the ending probably belongs to the <UNK> of great endings in cinema the western civilization blown to pieces a <UNK> an <UNK> br br <UNK> two international films the british blow up and the american zabriskie point are lesser efforts than the previous masterpieces but that is largely because of the faster pace and the inevitably contrived settings swinging london flower power america but when it comes down to it it's clear he hasn't lost the edge
<START> this is a great ending to the show the fact that <UNK> <UNK> was able to do a double switch on the <UNK> was great the fact that she allowed herself to be infected thus <UNK> the queen with a poison that in essence ended the <UNK> was great the way they ended it also left some not a lot for a reunion movie however they did bring them home and the way they did it was fantastic it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family ending it with tom and <UNK> having their baby just as they enter the <UNK> <UNK> was a great way to show a new beginning it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type just to see where their characters would be today
<START> this film is to my mind the weakest film in the original star wars trilogy for a variety of reasons however it emerges at the end of the day a winner despite all its flaws it's still a very good film even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 <UNK> br br one problem here is the look of the film which isn't very consistent with the other 2 films i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary <UNK> the first 2 films have that dirty lived in look with all the technology and so forth in jedi on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry <UNK> this makes for a much less <UNK> film also the creatures were <UNK> muppet like and <UNK> at this point it seems like the film makers were more concerned with creating the <UNK> for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself br br another aspect is its lack of originality where star wars created a whole new experience in cinema and empire brought us to alien worlds of <UNK> ice and clouds jedi <UNK> re <UNK> the locations of the first film first we are back on the desert planet <UNK> and then we are watching them face another death star maybe the emperor couldn't think of anything new but you'd think lucas or <UNK> could also we have these ewoks who really are just <UNK> made for <UNK> teddy bears in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big <UNK> fight at the end of star wars if they hadn't run out of cash it just feels like lazy construction br br the most unfortunate aspect of jedi for me is the weak handling of the han solo character whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time <UNK> one liners with the <UNK> instead of a real drama we're stuck with the lame <UNK> that han is still convinced leia loves luke as if the conclusion of empire where she <UNK> her love of him had never happened the whole thing is very contrived and barely <UNK> the fact that the solo character was not part of this film's central story after his rescue ford for his part looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances this is more like a 1990s ford performance bored and looking above the film itself fisher for her part is <UNK> high in some scenes <UNK> an interesting character introduced in empire here is stuck as the <UNK> person we care about in the giant space battle only <UNK> given an interesting development in the luke character is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package ian <UNK> does excellent work as well as the emperor the film would sink if he had been too far over the top as he was at times in the new films br br visually and in terms of effects work other than the clean look of everything it's hard to find fault <UNK> is a very effective <UNK> character one of the most elaborate ever constructed the space battles towards the end are very impressive br br ultimately this film <UNK> to success based on the <UNK> of its <UNK> but on its own it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of <UNK> later productions
<START> legendary movie producer walt disney brought three of the world's greatest fairy tales to the screen they remain among the most popular animated films of all time the first was his groundbreaking classic snow white and the seven <UNK> released in <UNK> the last was the then under appreciated sleeping beauty which made it's debut in 1959 in between these two was perhaps his most satisfying adaptation of a classic fairy tale cinderella 1950 of the three films cinderella is the one most faithful to its origins ironically unlike snow white which for better or worse became for many the definitive version of the story cinderella did not follow the same path although it was a hit and like snow white was responsible for <UNK> the <UNK> disney <UNK> it never achieved the same audience recognition which it certainly deserved disney for once did himself proud <UNK> not to <UNK> with a classic instead <UNK> and adding substance to the tale rather than <UNK> it for the screen the result was enchanting br br a combination of superb animation in beautifully soft technicolor and the perfect voice talents brought the story to life with a <UNK> that <UNK> to this day <UNK> woods who was a radio performer recorded <UNK> <UNK> of the songs as a favor to the authors of the material al hoffman mack david and jerry <UNK> when disney heard them he knew he had found his cinderella and indeed he had woods heartfelt <UNK> of a dream is a wish your heart makes so this is love and oh sing sweet <UNK> are perfect <UNK> <UNK> who would go on to voice <UNK> in sleeping beauty masterfully captured the icy cruelty of the stepmother while <UNK> williams and lucille bliss were convincingly nasty <UNK> luis van <UNK> admirably performed as both the king and the grand duke and james macdonald was endearing as both <UNK> and gus <UNK> devoted mice william <UNK> has little dialog as the prince future talk show host mike douglas provided his singing voice but film and disney veteran <UNK> <UNK> was born to play the fairy <UNK> and she made the best number the oscar nominated <UNK> <UNK> boo her own show <UNK> br br among the artists responsible for the look of the film was mary blair whose inspired use of color was greatly admired by disney her elegant french period backgrounds add tremendously to the quality of the movie but most important of <UNK> are the believable characters from cinderella right down to <UNK> the <UNK> deliciously evil cat they bring both life and <UNK> to the often told story something very difficult to create in an animated film br br in <UNK> with the film's <UNK> year <UNK> and not so <UNK> the coming holiday season cinderella has just been released on a special edition dvd it simply has never looked better the fully restored film must be seen to be appreciated suffice it to say it looks wonderful an enhanced <UNK> soundtrack has been added and serves the music well the dvd extras now a standard part of disney <UNK> <UNK> are too numerous to list here but as usual some are directed towards children some are <UNK> to adults and the rest fall somewhere in between but real fans will want to get the <UNK> gift set because along with an actual cell from the film and eight character sketches it includes a <UNK> page <UNK> book which not only <UNK> most of the material found in the book with the 1995 special edition home video release but much more as well as usual for disney cinderella will only be available for a limited time so if like me you are a cinderella lover get it now this edition is truly a dream come true
<START> i just saw the third week of stephen <UNK> nightmares and <UNK> mini series meaning i saw 6 episodes so far i have to say that the stories are really weak i have read stephen king's <UNK> crew a collection of his short stories that was published way back i recall most of the stories were average to poor but there was one that was really excellent if not outstanding br br what i'm trying to say is that just because this mini series is from a collection of stories from stephen king does not mean that it will be any good in fact if his previous collection of short stories are of any indication then most of this mini series will be average to poor br br in stephen king's defense i have not read these new short stories perhaps they are good as stories in a book and not readily <UNK> to television or perhaps it was the fault of the <UNK> in trying to write an interesting script who knows also these short stories may have been made exclusively for this mini series and not not for print purpose maybe that may have been the problem if stephen king had <UNK> these crap stories to an editor i am sure the editor would have immediately told him to make it more interesting because as is it is simply boring br br what is clear from all of this is that the problem is with the stories script and not the actors and actresses because this mini series has some excellent people acting on it br br seeing this mini series really makes me appreciate those old twilight zone series each series was only half an hour but it was compelling and riveting i don't understand why this mini series could not accomplish similar feat i am sure this mini series had a good deal of money to make a good mini series but unfortunately something must not have <UNK> br br for instance this week there were two episodes shown the first involved a horror story writer who buys a picture drawn by an artist who committed suicide the writer begins to see changes in the picture as he is driving <UNK> feeling uncomfortable he throws away the painting but it keeps appearing near him also the portrait of an individual in that picture is killing people and is out to kill him i will not even mention the second episode for this week involving criminals and their <UNK> because it was even more boring than this episode br br this premise is interesting and so the story should be good but after seeing it i was frustrated because there were too many gaps in the story as well as <UNK> <UNK> that was shown that did nothing to help the story after the last scene i was left with more questions than answers br br i tried for 3 weeks to get into this mini series but it was just too <UNK> due to poor stories script if this was a movie i would have recommended that people should wait for the movie to come out on cable or such i would not even recommend that it be rented in your video store however given that this is on <UNK> a cable channel i would say if you have not seen it already then try it for one week if you do not like it that week then you will not like the past series nor the future ones since they all share the same boring <UNK>
<START> surprised to see the rather low score for this movie just saw this film for the first time in 10 years and was reminded why i like it br br come back with me children to a time when michael keaton was a straight up comedy guy and you might find some joy in this film it's a gentle comedy the kind ron howard <UNK> in but if that's your thing you should check this out keaton's low key charm is just right for this project br br <UNK> ho is a bit dated because it takes places in the last stage of the pre global economy world when it still <UNK> what country a business was based in that said it delivers laughs as well as a lesson on how people can learn from each other to great benefit br br you could watch this film and enjoy it without remembering one scene in particular you really liked but that's because the whole movie provides a slow but constant stream of laughs it's like an i v <UNK> and i mean that in a good way
<START> i wish kids movies were still made this way dark and deep there was get this character development and charlie is the epitome of the dynamic character plot development superb animation emotional involvement and a rational <UNK> and consistent theme if not for the handful of song and dance routines you would never have thought this was a kids movie and this is why i give it such a high rating this movie is an excellent film let alone for a kids' movie which brings me to my second point this has got to be the darkest kids' movie i've seen in quite some time this coming from a 22 year old i'd be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever come across ala jurassic <UNK> for those of you who are <UNK> fans and this is what makes this movie so good just because the movie universally evokes emotions we don't normally like to feel and assume are bad does not make the movie itself bad in fact it means it succeeded good funny movies are supposed to make us laugh good horror movies are supposed to make us scared good sad movies are supposed to make us sad my point is good movies are supposed to move you not simply entertain this movie moved me br br also this movie is incredibly violent by today's standards for a kids' movie and contains subject matter that by today's standards may not be suitable for some children parents i'd say watch it first i'm not usually one to say anything about this kind of thing but i just saw this yesterday and it came as a surprise even to me
<START> if you like jamie foxx alvin sanders date from hell <UNK> you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with <UNK> <UNK> size and at the same time lots of gold bars alvin sanders has plenty of fbi eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw and david morse edgar <UNK> hack <UNK> tv series decides to zero in on poor alvin and use him as a so called fish hook to attract the criminals there is lots of laughs drama cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the junk yard jamie foxx and david morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture
<START> well after three times through i still have no idea what this movie is about because quite honestly it failed to generate any real interest or concern but here it goes a bunch of too old to be teen teen actors dressed in horrifying latter 1980's fashions did we look like that too decide it would be a really good idea to get in a <UNK> and go visit the abandoned <UNK> after one of them has nightmares of people being slaughtered in various horrifying ways that manage to rip off <UNK> the evil dead and freddy <UNK> in one fell <UNK> the <UNK> even <UNK> himself being <UNK> over an open fire with some <UNK> freak <UNK> off <UNK> of <UNK> good thing it was only a dream or it might have hurt and good thing his dreams had a decent special effects budget mine are usually pretty lame girls model space ships blowing things up with a <UNK> etc br br once on the <UNK> island they find themselves in a slasher movie and meet up with tony basil who cannot help but break into a couple dance poses at times and had her own lighting crew complete with a smoke machine for that 1980's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> light look which i kind of miss and such reminded me that ms basil helped <UNK> david <UNK> of the talking heads for some of his videos and performances this of course has nothing at all to do with the film but kept popping into mind as the movie <UNK> very little to actually think about it sort of happens and you can either watch or keep working on your page <UNK> with it on the tv set off to the side but since the film isn't really interesting you'll keep deciding to finish one last thing instead of wasting time the movie will keep ending and you'll find yourself wondering what you missed every time you realize the end credits are starting to roll again <UNK> br br some 1980's teen horror movies can survive such <UNK> viewing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mall it's <UNK> the hard to ignore night of the creeps and the over the top <UNK> camp all come to mind they are films that like them or not demand your attention and usually pay off with some good gore or t a and <UNK> in your work as evidence that you were watching the tv instead of your keyboard i am sure that hell island as the british version i <UNK> onto is titled does indeed have some good stuff in there but frankly i don't care and nothing is more annoying that <UNK> art of any genre that doesn't inspire admiration some decent dislike or even good old honest hatred for it the film is content with <UNK> away 80 whatever minutes of time and never really <UNK> anything more than being a sometimes distraction in spite of my best efforts to try and give it a chance but no <UNK> br br there is some offbeat production design going on the use of lighting is striking at times and the occasional <UNK> of mayhem will probably keep fans of 1980's teen horror interested the rest of you be warned though you will wonder if you dressed like that in 1987 and the answer is probably more hideous than anything which happens on screen try to watch it as a free rental if possible so that if disappointed you aren't stuck with the damn thing movies like this take up valuable shelf space that is often at a <UNK> these days what with the world coming to an end all
<START> well you'd better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish bland and <UNK> flick about a middle aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like set in <UNK> mom <UNK> around the flat gets <UNK> and decides albeit reluctantly she just can't help herself to don the costume and dance in a local <UNK> meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons the common <UNK> is a <UNK> band drummer this film is so full of filler i watched the dvd at <UNK> and read the subtitles fast <UNK> through much of the very ordinary dancing and <UNK> shots of walking they walk everywhere and more walking and just plain <UNK> at <UNK> just to get though this boring <UNK> low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical <UNK> go figure c
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> alexandre <UNK> are partners in a company together with <UNK> george <UNK> but the first ones contract a professional killer <UNK> to murder <UNK> the plot at least at the beginning doesn't explain very well why the guy does it and after receiving his money he starts <UNK> the two partners appearing in their company and saying he wants a job there as <UNK> or <UNK> at the same time he meets <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> daughter of <UNK> and starts dating with her br br in a story like this where crime corruption betrayal and blackmail go hand in hand no one is innocent or can be <UNK> exception made to <UNK> which is the only person who doesn't know what's going on and didn't <UNK> <UNK> br br this film portrays with sarcasm the sad and cruel reality which exists in big metropolis like <UNK> <UNK> where crime is every day's presence we can feel irony but also <UNK> in characters like <UNK> brilliantly played by <UNK> <UNK> which does blackmail to the guys who paid him without any <UNK> and even <UNK> with the daughter of the guy he killed he really must be a monster to do something like that but of course i know <UNK> people like him out there in brazil or any other <UNK> br br it's a very good movie cruel but truthful about a sad <UNK> the acting is great and the soundtrack too
<START> seriously there is absolutely nothing good about this crap fest at all randolph scott a closet homosexual who lived with his lover cary grant for twelve years is at his most wooden and boring in the least role at <UNK> he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles although it doesn't matter so much here because <UNK> russell looks so much older than her <UNK> years and she is so ugly due to her <UNK> alcoholism and chain smoking lee marvin plays his usual villainous role but it isn't enough to save this garbage thank god they don't make westerns any more they're just dated racist old movies that <UNK> guns and murder br br 0 10
<START> i first saw this in the movie theater when it came out and the crowd was really into the movie which made the experience all the more fun this is a great cast of characters many big names in it a few of which were not as recognized then as they are now i think it's a great idea if you follow any of these actors or have loved them in other movies to add it to your watched list some of the scenes actually remind me of the type of well done comedy as in the <UNK> or even the clue kind of odd spontaneous appearing comedy with some really professional delivery from these beloved actors the movie did a great job at giving you some insight perhaps even very realistic into the culture of a daytime soap
<START> mae clarke will always be remembered as the girl whose face james cagney showed a <UNK> into in the same year's the public enemy she will not be remembered for this weird little story about a a <UNK> girl who finds that her past will always be with her br br in some ways this looks a bit <UNK> for 1931 almost as if you are looking at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lights of new york but don't be fooled although ted <UNK> photography is still in the big scenes there's lots of movement <UNK> distraction to the <UNK> in the set ups to them but in competition with the fast paced stuff that it seems that everyone was doing at <UNK> this attempt to bring the woman's viewpoint into the genre as a <UNK> doesn't work nor is mae clarke the actress to carry the effort
<START> a man <UNK> to life alone after 45 years of marriage he also has to solve the problem of the family <UNK> cow <UNK> which refuses to allow itself to be <UNK> until that is he <UNK> his wife who was the one who used to milk <UNK> br br <UNK> is based on a real story told in <UNK> family of her <UNK> generation the film is a nostalgic look back at a disappearing way of life one where people still felt some sense of responsibility for each other set in the lush green victorian the australian state not the era countryside br br writer and director <UNK> evidently has further ambitions in both areas and this multiple award winning 15 minute short is a fine beginning to her reel
<START> atlantis the lost empire is a better movie than i thought i never thought this movie would lead to my expectations true this movie started slow but as the movie wore on it became more to my liking the story takes place in <UNK> and is about a guy named milo milo believes in the <UNK> atlantis along with friends of his grandfather he <UNK> on an amazing adventure of his own along the way he must <UNK> friendship betrayal trust and more the voice cast is great they surely know how to carry movies with only their voice talent the music is nothing special but likable anyway the animation is not the best but it is still good enough overall this is a good family movie for all ages i rate this movie 9 10
<START> i saw this movie when i was about 8 years old and i liked it but it wasn't until i watched it again at the age of 13 that i really understood it for what it is a cartoon about a criminal dog with a real heart of gold <UNK> a little girl in order to exploit her for her talents to talk to animals the dog star charlie b <UNK> is murdered by his <UNK> business partner carface who is absolutely diabolical by the way his soul then goes to where else but heaven only to find a golden watch that is really his life's time which charlie being the <UNK> but lovable <UNK> that he is steals and <UNK> sending him back to earth once back on earth charlie goes about seeking revenge on the evil carface this is how he comes upon young anne marie the lonely little orphan that can talk to animals whom charlie plans to <UNK> for her talents in order to get back at his enemy carface but <UNK> charlie actually comes to care for young anne marie and his plans <UNK> as he must make up his mind to do what is right after anne marie discovers what her best friend charlie has really been using her to make money for a new and better dog casino now he must rescue her from the <UNK> carface i still love this movie even at the age of 22 the idea and plot really are quite different and original from that of many other animated films i especially like the idea that a dog plays the role of the villain for once carface was even better than he was in the all dogs go to heaven sequel in that picture he appeared quite dubious to his role of villain
<START> put aside a dr house repeat that i had missed and a desperate <UNK> new to watch this one i don't know exactly what plagued this movie i never thought i'd say this but i want my 15 minutes of fame back br br script direction i can't say i recognized the stable of actors the usual suspects but thought herbert marshall was a class addition and sat myself down for a good cheesy flick boy was i wrong <UNK> br br my favorite parts where the office girl makes with the <UNK> <UNK> and puts the cards into a <UNK> <UNK> lol the computer i'd like someone identify the next device a <UNK> it's before even this <UNK> time br br and we dinosaurs don't have that much time to waste
<START> spoilers this was an ugly movie and i'm sorry that i watched it like jan <UNK> <UNK> it suffers mostly from poor editing or lack of it it is as if the director was so in love with his work that instead of cutting the movie down to a pace that kept your attention he added all of the footage he had shot together there are maybe two cool scenes in the entire movie one of them is spoiler when <UNK> is <UNK> and the camera starts spinning around him that was cool but okay we got it move on please the camera won't stop spinning around this guy there's maybe one or two more cool scenes that i forgot about in this <UNK> of mediocrity but the last duel scene is not one of them it may be because unlike in the earlier sword handling scenes <UNK> isn't masked but just because the director couldn't find a <UNK> who somewhat <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> doesn't give him the right to go ahead and make up 80 of the sword fight with extreme close ups of sword <UNK> and all from the same angle may i add the director should learn from the american produced 1995 bullet train ninja movie the hunted i personally saw the village raid scene as a tribute paid to the social <UNK> of the previous generation who were confronted by the police in the violent <UNK> of their college years the situation where innocence is <UNK> by an <UNK> and armed branch of the government unwilling to understand seems to be a message common in the japanese media due to the strong influence of <UNK> and <UNK> who are a political minority the movie versions of <UNK> and <UNK> man <UNK> are two other recent examples end spoiler i don't understand i just don't understand why people who don't speak the language of the movie find praise worthy material in this maybe the worst was lost in the translation br br the ending of the movie on which marketing played a lot is a different interpretation of the legendary encounter between <UNK> and <UNK> but that legend is not the most popular in japanese <UNK> and it is so detached from contemporary themes that after <UNK> minutes of over played visual techniques who cares how the director wants to re interpret the story director <UNK> <UNK> of crazy lips said that there was an unpleasant trend among new japanese directors to ignore japanese audiences and target their movies for foreign film festivals in order to gain faster international fame this works although it doesn't make sense because the point of an international movie fest is to introduce to the world what kind of movies are being made in other countries what kind of movies people watch in those countries certainly not <UNK> and the like
<START> everyone is either loving or hating this film i am going with loving it is so well shot and so well acted beautiful this film is for people who appreciate well crafted film making if you are not a fan of well done films of course you would hate this but if you like the tops of acting photography story and development look no further then here
<START> the unseen is done in a style more like old hollywood mysteries than a horror show the film is somewhat slow but lots of bizarre imagery keeps it the film alive and watchable the basic idea of young girls stalked by something in the basement is old but good acting and production make the movie worth watching the movie is notable for its emotional impact and certainly not for any explicit action or special effects i rated it an 8 out of 10
<START> <UNK> tarzan and his mate 1934 released 4 20 1934 viewed 8 6 <UNK> br br john dillinger escapes from prison and <UNK> a bank in <UNK> bonnie clyde kill two highway <UNK> in texas <UNK> ralph <UNK> gloria <UNK> alan arkin richard chamberlain br br doug after we were rather disappointed with the original <UNK> the ape man ' we discovered among fellow users and historians that the second film <UNK> and his mate ' was the best in the series it's true i got a huge kick out of this movie johnny <UNK> returns as the titular <UNK> swinging animal <UNK> wild super hero and maureen <UNK> <UNK> her role as his entirely fantastic lady love jane who sports a two piece outfit for the first and last time here in my review for <UNK> man ' i <UNK> on jane pretty good for her obsession with clothes and her <UNK> screaming but she's redeemed herself for me here make no mistake <UNK> is the star of this movie and jane is the most capable character in the entire cast she acts as the <UNK> between holt and tarzan she can function perfectly in the jungle and get along with the animals and she knows how to hold off an angry pride of lions when she's out of bullets she's even got her own jungle scream now the chemistry between johnny and maureen is irresistible she's totally got him trained <UNK> is quite charming as well taking drags off of <UNK> cigarette the plot is mostly an excuse for tarzan to do battle with the <UNK> most vicious animals especially lions <UNK> and <UNK> the effects though always visible are much more dynamic and cool and <UNK> the action nicely oh and you can't talk about this movie without talking about the nude swimming scene all i can say is yes she is naked very exciting stuff br br kevin wow just wow when it comes to down and dirty pre code action adventure nothing holds a candle to <UNK> and his mate ' the inevitable sequel to tarzan the ape man is a kick ass violent and <UNK> jungle epic i doubt there will be another tarzan movie in the future that takes no prisoners the way this one does you'd be hard pressed to find a full scene in this movie that would be code <UNK> or animal rights <UNK> for that matter the gruesome violence doesn't even wait for the happy jungle couple to show up before it pushes even the limits of today's adventure movies and after t j enter the picture there's plenty of early morning <UNK> and ass naked afternoon <UNK> see it for yourself if you don't believe me i love maureen <UNK> most of all in this film in the first film jane seemed like a walking <UNK> like the writers back then just didn't know how to portray a character like that but here she is a great <UNK> to kick butt females of later cinema although she still requires <UNK> assistance in getting her out of most <UNK> she does a lot more than just waiting around to be rescued her personality is perfectly believable for a woman who has been living relatively <UNK> in the jungle for a year i watched this with my mom and i enjoyed pointing out to her just how much jane has tarzan trained as jeff <UNK> put it she totally has the ape man at her every <UNK> and call although there is a host of dated <UNK> effects throughout the film there is still plenty of hair raising tarzan vs predator battles that are performed mostly for real that and the men dressed as apes are a lot more convincing this time around spoiler the film <UNK> as the jungle <UNK> with a shocking orgy of animal kingdom violence that leaves tarzan and jane the only two humans still breathing although the couple rides off into the sunset reunited and <UNK> i can't help but imagine how this story will seem to the next <UNK> who will hear about the previous bunch of humans who went to find tarzan and jane and were never heard from again end spoiler one of things that still bothers me is johnny <UNK> smooth <UNK> <UNK> and over <UNK> <UNK> other than that this is pre code action adventure that is absolutely not to be missed br br last film it happened one night 1934 next film <UNK> century 1934
<START> i love this film the noir imagery combined with <UNK> no nonsense character mike hammer works <UNK> to create a mood and feel seldom found in low budget detective films of the early fifties it may not be 'the <UNK> <UNK> but this film makes it's own solid contribution to the genre <UNK> is often <UNK> for alleged <UNK> etc but his <UNK> are way above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence poor old mike hammer as effectively played by <UNK> elliott is <UNK> by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist whom he meets when investigating the death of an army buddy when the penny finally drops his face is a picture good to see that 50s censorship did not force the film makers to <UNK> the famous last line a <UNK> <UNK> low budget classic
<START> <UNK> something mysteriously dense that <UNK> radio <UNK> is discovered in the ice of <UNK> the mysterious block is <UNK> out and brought to a research station on <UNK> julian rome a former <UNK> worker is brought in to <UNK> the message problem is that one of the <UNK> is a old girlfriend of his and the situation quickly turns awkward especially since the other female <UNK> practically throw themselves at him and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting <UNK> quickly soon the object is in the open the mystery continues though as the object <UNK> a huge amount of electricity it is decided to open the object but just before that is done julian <UNK> the <UNK> do not open but too late and the object explodes as it is finally <UNK> and two things unleashed on earth the first is an alien that had been <UNK> in the object and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff and washington that is <UNK> updated on this historic event decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth so a russian nuclear submarine carrying nuclear weapons is sent to <UNK> br br comments the movie holds a few surprises one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful well worked through and a lot better than expected unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own and this time not in a good way actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes it is never really explained why washington know so much why washington is able to command russian <UNK> why the object is in the <UNK> and has <UNK> up now it is really puzzling that the alien <UNK> is <UNK> in understandable english some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language and obviously chose english why but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus send their do not open message <UNK> and finally the end is as open as an end can be br br the movie is a little entertaining but too much energy from me must be <UNK> to fill in the <UNK> in the plot therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good br br 3 10
<START> i started to watch this movie expecting nothing just another movie to watch but since the first twenty minutes the artwork and main character who is enigmatic doesn't talk much really got me in this movie br br i really liked this movie it was dark beautifully acted and really touching it's a bit slow but the <UNK> was complete the directing was awesome by letting us know bits by bits the story leading to the conviction of joey and his life behind bars the music was really great and very well <UNK> into the scenes the ending was unexpected with a twist i didn't see coming it's not the kind of movie we see often
<START> stupid and just plain weird movie about some kid who becomes traumatized when he finds out santa isn't real he grows up and becomes an adult brandon <UNK> who makes lists of people who are naughty or nice one christmas he <UNK> and sets out to kill the naughty people dressed as santa of course br br boring and just plain bad killer santa movie if you're looking for gore it's not here only a few of the murders are shown and they're not that gory with very fake effects most of the movie just contains brandon <UNK> talking to himself and slowly going crazy the script is trite the acting is terrible and it leads to an ending which had me staring slack <UNK> at the tv seriously i had to <UNK> the tape and watch it again to make sure i wasn't <UNK> really really poor ending br br if you want a scary christmas flick rent black christmas the original 70s version not the terrible remake avoid this one at all costs
<START> <UNK> <UNK> society albeit from perfect is a <UNK> compelling film for what it tries to depict in its uber conventional realm it's a <UNK> <UNK> picture involving cops versus japanese or chinese gangsters mostly chinese as the title suggests but already even in his first technical <UNK> takashi miike is already establishing many aspects to films that he would make from here on in social issues like black market <UNK> of precious goods in this case human organs usually from children nostalgia for childhood and one's roots which was especially prevalent in dead or alive 2 <UNK> of the nose at <UNK> like gay sex and satirical rape violence towards women blood <UNK> violence it's certainly not as surreal as some of miike's most recent films but this is expected as he's trying out things that he's just starting to learn following a track record of straight to video <UNK> it's got all of those qualities and it's also like the films that would follow from it equally savage and heartfelt crazy in spots and <UNK> in its drama and solid for genre fans br br the story concerns two brothers one a chinese orphan raised in japan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pretty decent as a eastwood esquire anti hero hero who's become a detective and another who's become a gangster or a would be one the main arch likely <UNK> gang comes from wang a definite pun on what the gang represents during its spare time played by <UNK> <UNK> as a typical <UNK> with real terror in his eyes and his partner <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who's threatening even when just repeating a <UNK> over and over to a woman who's just had her eye <UNK> out following a sour deal who are the ruthless kind to pop up almost <UNK> in a miike movie there's some intrigue involving the <UNK> <UNK> scheme with the gangsters which <UNK> almost becomes a victim of and the <UNK> <UNK> for gay sex at least with one little puppet of sorts who does whatever the main gangsters want it all leads up to vengeance and redemption qualities that miike and his writer are trying to <UNK> from shakespeare hence the <UNK> bit with wang <UNK> his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying it won't come off br br if it doesn't add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great shakespeare play would have it's par for the course of a film like this miike's goals are met though just met in his low scale ambitions a gangster picture with some added levels of harsh <UNK> trouble the main tension between the brothers comes out of profession and duty to parents notes on the <UNK> aspects of underworld crime and what the realm of <UNK> sex with both <UNK> brings out psychologically in the characters at the same time <UNK> <UNK> society also contains more than a few moments of classic biting black comedy from the miike <UNK> some of it just has to be taken with a grain of salt for what the director does in his <UNK> like the bit at the beginning with the chair <UNK> over the face or the <UNK> of the <UNK> as it goes into a very twisted area there's even a laugh out loud line from the young sex slave after finishing an act on one of the bosses thank you mr <UNK> <UNK> miike and his writer don't have enough here to make the film a full on dark comedy like <UNK> or of course visitor q but there's enough to bring some appropriate <UNK> to the darker aspects to the story and characters br br as the first entry of the black society trilogy as it's called i was quite impressed and it's a fine quasi calling card from one of the <UNK> new artists in contemporary cinema
<START> several story lines are <UNK> here around different women characters the shoes they wear serve as an indication of their troubled lives all are transformed at the end of the movie <UNK> <UNK> san juan leads a <UNK> her daughter anita monica <UNK> is retarded and has a <UNK> life <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a shoe designer with problems and loses her boyfriend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has lost her husband and now raises the children from his deceased former wife <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a bored rich lady br br other characters are used to connect the five main women characters in storytelling not everything is given away in the beginning some connections are established surprisingly late in the movie and that adds to the experience the shoe theme is driven to extremes for example when <UNK> as a shoe designer and working in a shoe store where she steals her shoes <UNK> she breaks one of her heels br br in editing small connections are made between the scenes a <UNK> rings a cigarette is lit a song etc are used to make the connection and fast cuts frequent change of storyline keeps it from being boring or reaching tv levels it is strongly music driven to set tone and atmosphere the cities of <UNK> and <UNK> serve as the backdrop for the stories and shots of those cities are used to <UNK> the story beyond the characters one of the more moving shots is when anita who makes the same walk every day <UNK> her walk and <UNK> life from the relative calm of her street to the busy main road how the <UNK> of space is visually translated is well done as with most spanish movies a lot of storytelling is done visually using the soap like stories as the simple backdrop there is a poetic ending that is somewhat romantic and sentimental but is still beautiful br br as <UNK> <UNK> is too much in love with his own material it is overlong some scenes are <UNK> and on the soap level including the acting <UNK> love life <UNK> doctor the shoe theme is exaggerated and is a weak metaphor br br this is often compared to <UNK> because the structure is the same but they are different <UNK> is more technically competent but somewhat mechanical this has more the ability to translate emotion and atmosphere visually after seeing this you are inclined to immediately move to the new movie city <UNK>
<START> this movie brings back many memories of the classic cinema of old where actors didn't have to take their clothes off to make viewers watch their film br br firstly i think the main plus point of this movie is the amazing chemistry between shahid and amrita it is definitely the making of the film br br i have seen lots of comments regarding the film being <UNK> sweet and overly <UNK> in response to this i think to a certain degree this is a correct analysis however considering this is a <UNK> film i think that compared to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> it has been toned down significantly <UNK> was almost unbearable to watch in some places br br in this film however when the sentimental moments come along you find yourself smiling wishing the budding couple all the best and hoping that nothing bad happens to them br br another major plus point is the performances of shahid and amrita both have acted very well especially shahid who looks great in the film amrita looks simply stunning and should be taken seriously as a future major star br br although i really enjoyed the film as a whole i do feel that it was too long some of the middle could have been <UNK> off and it would maybe made even more of an impact i also think the music although it fits into the film when you see the situations is slightly old fashioned and the movie could have <UNK> if a more up to date soundtrack had been available although the <UNK> of the songs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are wonderful br br all in all i definitely recommend this film its romantic looks stunning and has a dramatic climax i won't go into details just in case you haven't seen it br br ps if you're prone to crying take a <UNK> i needed several
<START> thanks <UNK> <UNK> for creating disney's 2 best cartoons ever this show has improved very much over the years as a kid i didn't like it because i thought it was a rip off of <UNK> which was my favorite disney thing at the time like <UNK> then later on though it was good but not great but after reading the reviews here i decided to give it another chance bought the dvd set watched the whole pilot the first day i got it was very pleasantly surprised it's still my favorite episode although the series did live up to it and by the end of disc 1 i knew this was going to be a top <UNK> br br the characters are so complex charming my favorite has got to be <UNK> he's absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot my next favorite is <UNK> the best pilot on the show i can see why <UNK> <UNK> built the show around him then it's <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> have the best relationship in the series after that <UNK> jim <UNK> did a perfect job of <UNK> the original voice after him rebecca she has made me laugh pretty hard and i do believe she and <UNK> eventually marry and finally for the heroes molly although she's my least favorite i still like her i think she's a very cute character much better than <UNK> from <UNK> and the villains were very original don <UNK> his air pirates always crack me up <UNK> is ice cold and ruthless and the <UNK> are always at least amusing br br as said before the stories range from hilarious time waits for no bear romance of red <UNK> to nothing short of touching the old man the <UNK> paradise lost to fun funny exciting adventures in search of ancient <UNK> my favorite for whom the bell <UNK> these are only a few of my favorite episodes anyway <UNK> is disney's best aside from <UNK> bears some reasons for this <UNK> had a decent amount of my favorite character <UNK> while <UNK> didn't have enough of <UNK> but in the end <UNK> remains a classic bottom line 10 10 <UNK> best cartoon ever
<START> first let's all agree that <UNK> lamas could never be considered a skilled actor barely even decent sometimes just plain lousy however in this piece of called <UNK> the film industry as a whole <UNK> br br first let's start with the plot a vietnam vet named jack kelly aka soldier who is supposed to be as tough as a <UNK> of leather and then some which you can believe when he <UNK> a <UNK> of nails through 2 <UNK> feet and <UNK> them to the floor gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister had some potential but still pretty thin to begin with br br now the acting being an actor myself i am <UNK> to say that this was some of the worst acting in the history of the art lamas is well himself the <UNK> playing the <UNK> deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere especially talented ones who never get their big break br br finally the action the <UNK> is so so at best and the fist fighting is <UNK> i've seen more real looking fights at the renaissance festival and those were pretty fake looking br br readers listen to me avoid this piece of <UNK> at all costs if it were the only film in existence you still would want to avoid it for the sake of your brain cell count do not watch this thing
<START> twist endings can be really cool in a movie it's especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes but we just don't pay attention those type of twist endings are the one's that make people think then we've got twists like this film has twists that whether or not you pay attention you have no clue what's going to happen when they reveal this kind of random twist instead of shock it's somewhat a <UNK> reaction this film starts off like it's going to be an interesting take on horror but after about 20 minutes it's nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid twist br br three young women are going to a concert so they get lost traveling through the woods and hit a tree <UNK> they end up at some old creepy <UNK> house who hates men and they are <UNK> by her <UNK> daughter marion laurel <UNK> strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasher br br this film is too caught up in it's dialogue and it's always between only a few characters we have the main three girls the creepy <UNK> and the old lady and conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five to make matters worse they never have anything interesting to say it's actually quite <UNK> sitting through their conversations we want to know what's going on and instead they just talk and talk and talk about nothing br br plot holes are <UNK> here the house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere wow three miles a two hour or less walk will kill them why didn't they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town did he have a one <UNK> how come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay rarely even checking up on each other why did this have to have so many dumb twists maybe the answers are in the boring script br br having a slasher film with five characters is really a bad idea it's not thrilling it's not scary and the ending is definitely out there but undoubtedly dumb br br my rating 1 2 out of <UNK> mins r for nudity and violence
<START> this movie was absolutely ghastly i cannot <UNK> how this movie made it to production nothing against the cast of the movie of course this is all the fault of the writing team you take the old average plot let's dance our way out of being poor and <UNK> or step in this case but this one lacks any semblance of a true plot or at least one that anyone would care about with canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an american setting this film falls very flat on a positive note the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well looks like the production budget was very generous as well my only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film net result how she move is how she sucks
<START> it's a short movie from david lynch with just 8 minutes but it got all the <UNK> ingredients it's mysterious dark <UNK> eerie and strange and before the blond girl starts to talk it's even a bit scary the soundtrack is exceptional to create this odd atmosphere because it's also sinister and <UNK> br br about the setting itself it hasn't the traditional red <UNK> but it has <UNK> purple painted walls which give it an equally effect of <UNK> br br the plot is about a girl who's locked in a dark room and she cries for help then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way saying she's there just because of her <UNK> we don't know what did happen or what will happen <UNK> it ended <UNK> and puzzling as a good lynch movie must end br br it's a great short despite some amateurish acting the girls are professional actresses but i think their acting could have been better in this short
<START> the movie began well enough it had a fellow get hit by a glowing green <UNK> getting <UNK> <UNK> x ray vision <UNK> flight the ability to speak to dogs <UNK> heat vision and the ability to make plants grow large and quickly and fighting crime from there on it's all downhill br br meteor man gets a costume from his mom fights with the resident gangs and has many <UNK> encounters with the gang leaders which serves to set you up for the disappointing overlong and <UNK> ending br br it wouldn't be so remarkably bad if it weren't like watching a boxing match where the two fighters pretend to hit each other while the audience stands looking <UNK> while the fighters just continue to dance br br despite all of this nonsense the movie has good points it states clearly that if you try to take on a gang alone then they'll come back to your home and hurt you it states that gangs <UNK> need to see their real enemies the big bosses that use them for their own ends to crush honest people into a ghetto existence it also states that people do not need <UNK> if they are willing to work as a community do destroy the <UNK> that harm them the only message it really lacks is that the voters should ensure their elected officials <UNK> <UNK> marion barry ronald reagan george w bush george h w bush aren't crooks too br br
<START> first of all write the script on a <UNK> who needs more than that after all we're not a hollywood film br br then get amateur actors it will be good for the festival hype after all who needs people who have spent years <UNK> their craft then hire a cinematographer who doesn't know how to light you see if it's well lit it won't look real and the festival people won't like it who needs to have professional level photography anyway then hire a ten year old who has never held a camera to be your <UNK> it will give your movie that completely amateurish touch that festival <UNK> will mistake for reality and guarantee that even though you will empty the seats from real people critics and a small <UNK> of the audience who over <UNK> will scream genius because they won't believe this was just complete amateur hour br br once you've done that buy your ticket to the festival of bad movies aka sundance br br what a sad waste
<START> this is the definite lars von trier movie my favorite i rank it higher than breaking the waves or the latest dancer in the dark i simply love the beauty of the picture the framing is so original acting is wonderful a must see
<START> do you know when you look at your collection of old <UNK> movies and realize that there are some that you've only seen once or twice and you can't remember if they're worth the time it takes to see them the <UNK> is was one of those films i found it not long ago and decided i might as well give it a chance i'm not entirely sure if i'm happy with my decision on one hand the film is really really bad on the other now i have another free tape yeah you get it the plot is predictable and not in any way original the pacing is bad the acting is bad but that's not really surprising seeing as the two leads are former soap opera stars they're used to <UNK> the characters are poorly written clich√©s the film even manages to screw up the <UNK> damn way to impress me through film court scenes even those don't <UNK> one single emotion for or against any of the cardboard thin characters the film just has no real redeeming qualities whatsoever even the dialog is bad the thing is it's so full of clich√©s that it's laughable and that's the one thing that lifts this above a rating of 1 10 the albeit unintentionally so comic relief of the many clich√©s and stereotypes i didn't pay very much attention to the film but just about every time i looked at the screen there was something to laugh at one final note i considered using the line <UNK> spelling can't act as a one line summary but i guess everyone knows that so i <UNK> for the current one seeing as it's more informative all in all a thoroughly bad film but not the worst if you've got nothing else to do and if it's on tv good for a few laughs if you can sit through it 3 10
<START> i watched this knowing almost nothing about it other than the brief description i read here after watching it i was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish then i looked at the other stuff he's done to see if this was his first or second movie but no he did house on haunted hill and fear <UNK> com he sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this one br br the story was pretty awful too could someone just fall in love with a girl because she's pretty but has the mind of a child i gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that i rather enjoyed near the end but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible
<START> and even then even they can live without seeing it to be honest this film if one <UNK> to call it that is of real interest only to bondage freaks bettie page fans will learn absolutely nothing new and i do mean nothing nor will they enjoy the warm <UNK> of experiencing anything familiar loved or <UNK> br br <UNK> the abysmal screenplay the wooden less than community theater acting the utter absence of direction the crappy lighting or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values this is definitely hey kids let's make a movie movie making of the lowest order i suppose one could be thankful that at least they knew how to run the camera no i'm sorry to say that none of that is <UNK> to why this thing is so outright wrong br br it's wrong because the young lady playing bettie page a somewhat <UNK> girl whose only resemblance to the queen of <UNK> is dark hair and the trademark <UNK> utterly fails to bring anything to the role beyond a <UNK> to be bound and <UNK> this is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this wretched excess but not for the wretched excess itself which consists primarily of a number of lovingly re <UNK> b d set pieces <UNK> between <UNK> awful faux <UNK> scenes <UNK> ms <UNK> fall from grace so to speak there's actually probably more information per se about <UNK> life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the movie br br do not be fooled this is not a worthy companion film to the notorious bettie page this is not a worthy film at all this is a fetish piece that <UNK> on the <UNK> of one of the greatest pin ups of all time and does it without class without style and without any real sense of understanding the character of bettie page whatsoever no true bettie page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment i guarantee that br br avoid at all costs if free remember that time is money too yours may not be worth much but i'm <UNK> it's worth enough that you'll be sorry you wasted time with this one that's it i'm done you've been warned
<START> cheap mediocre sequel to the successful the <UNK> hand has presumably dead evil professor <UNK> george <UNK> preparing his predecessor <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for the quest of revenge overseas to america using mummy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jr who has no reason being in the disguise any stunt man could do the same credible work <UNK> around and <UNK> victims in the goal of killing the surviving members of the <UNK> family whose <UNK> stephen dick <UNK> and assistant babe <UNK> wallace ford <UNK> the <UNK> corpse of princess <UNK> from her tomb in egypt <UNK> considers this an outlandish act of <UNK> and wants the family to suffer for doing such an awful deed towards an ancient egyptian <UNK> <UNK> and the mummy <UNK> find a nice <UNK> in a cemetery where the high priest of <UNK> can work as a caretaker in disguise every full moon <UNK> will feed <UNK> a form of <UNK> derived of several <UNK> leaves which will keep him not only alive but <UNK> to his <UNK> wishes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to kill stephen and his sister jane mary gordon while also <UNK> time for babe to return so that he will become victim 3 dr john <UNK> john <UNK> plans to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> knox but doesn't know that <UNK> secretly <UNK> his fianc√© making plans to kidnap her with <UNK> help john's life is in danger because of his father he's also the last remaining member of the <UNK> line if <UNK> has <UNK> there's no chance of any more <UNK> being born the police must find <UNK> and the one responsible for his carnage <UNK> br br this film is a <UNK> from hand set years later as members of that film <UNK> ford <UNK> all appear in aging make up providing <UNK> showing the gaps in time as <UNK> has been preparing for the deaths of the <UNK> the <UNK> romance of john and <UNK> seems merely in this plot so that <UNK> will screw up <UNK> his perfect plan which was being carried out successfully before he <UNK> it up and <UNK> merely sees her <UNK> with john on the grass the whole love at first sight rubbish really didn't wash for me plus you have the mummy being able to kill people with one arm is any mummy really that powerful this film also uses a ton of footage from the previous film to save budget on this sequel to it there really isn't that much story here and yes typical of universal monster pictures even in america a mob of people will light ho hum <UNK> going after <UNK> you know how it'll end john and the super powerful <UNK> will square off in some huge mansion with fire burning all around them with the evil one being <UNK> in flame
<START> having heard so many people raving about this film i thought i'd give it a go apart from being incredibly slow which i don't mind as long as the wait is worth it but it just isn't as many others have said there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this film just doesn't ring true the reaction of the 4 men switches from shock horror on finding the body to complete indifference whilst they fish surely if they were the type of men that would go on happily fishing then they would have just reported the body and said they had only discovered it after their fishing trip why on earth tie the body to a tree go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body 2 days previously its so hard to watch a film knowing that the behaviour of the main characters is so inconsistent as for the rest of the <UNK> well you'd think at least one of them might show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman the body itself naked except for the <UNK> what scenario leads to that if she was raped then why still the <UNK> if she was raped with the clothes on then why remove them afterwards bar the <UNK> if she wasn't raped then why take all her clothes off bar the <UNK> leaving yourself with evidence to <UNK> of i truly cant think of any realistic scenario that would lead to that other than killing someone to steal their clothes so you can fill up your <UNK> sale <UNK> oh well its watchable but only just and only because despite the poor script the acting is strong
<START> it is one of the better indian movies i have seen lately instead of crappy song and dance or <UNK> dog movies all the actors have showed the right emotions at the right intensity with right timing it is the hallmark of a good movie that it make the viewer go back and research the subject which exactly what i did checking on harilal i always enjoy akshay <UNK> subtle style of acting and interestingly he had rather a complicated relationship with his own father <UNK> <UNK> albeit not as dramatic as <UNK> and wonder how it helped him <UNK> this character i was impressed by the direction and 2 thumbs up for anil kapoor for producing such a classy movie
<START> s s van <UNK> must have been a <UNK> businessman in dealing with hollywood most of the film <UNK> from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios but apparently van <UNK> must have sold his rights to each book about philo vance one at a time note that paramount mgm warner brothers and more all released philo vance films only tarzan seemed to get around hollywood more br br mgm produced the garden murder case and starred edmund lowe as the <UNK> detective of course mgm had the <UNK> original philo under contract at the time but bill powell was busy doing the thin man at the time and i guess louis b <UNK> decided to concentrate him there br br edmund lowe is a pretty acceptable philo vance lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with what price glory and then with a string of films with victor mclaglen with their <UNK> and <UNK> characters but after mclaglen got his oscar for the informer lowe seemed to fade into the b picture market br br the garden murder case involves three separate victims douglas <UNK> gene <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the sinister atmosphere around the <UNK> kind of gives it away the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished br br i will say this though vance takes a very big chance in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of hitchcock
<START> this film is <UNK> made unoriginal garbage i like romantic comedies sometimes watching a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner it's not something you are going to do all the time but the experience is so <UNK> that you can ignore how <UNK> you are being this movie made me think about how stupid i was for continuing to remain <UNK> for its entire running time everything about it screamed made on the cheap it actually looks like they <UNK> the film at certain points it is so washed out it boasts cheesy cgi and lame sets too br br the writing was clunky i know that you can usually expect some plot problems in a screwball comedy but you usually don't really care because you are laughing this movie is so unfunny that you actually sit there and wonder about the unlikely series of <UNK> and completely unbelievable behavior involved events were placed in the film just to move the characters from one scene to the next or to provide exposition sure this is how all movies work but you shouldn't notice that it's happening <UNK> that's the term i should use br br there was almost no one in the movie who was really likable i didn't care who ended up with whom as long as they all stayed the hell away from me and i didn't have to listen to them talk about it anymore why would the only really cool character in the movie the paul rudd character want to have anything to do with the completely bitchy condescending control freak played by eva longoria also almost all of the characters involved consistently picked the <UNK> solution to any situation a straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to hang out and <UNK> with with a woman he is attracted to the best feel good moment they could come up with was to <UNK> on a happy ending for the same <UNK> where he gets together with <UNK> equally annoying lying <UNK> sister lake bell and eva longoria are very attractive appealing women maybe they will find something better to appear in down the road
<START> starring jim carrey morgan freeman jennifer <UNK> i was really quite skeptical the first time i watched this movie i mean what a <UNK> nightmare jim carrey playing god nothing is sacred anymore br br well this movie is hardly sacred but it also is not <UNK> at least not to any great extent yes jim carrey has the powers of god for a while but he is not god confused i'll give you the low down br br jim carrey plays bruce nolan a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very <UNK> with his life he lives with his beautiful girlfriend grace <UNK> and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground br br then bruce gets a shot at anchorman only to have it <UNK> stolen by <UNK> <UNK> obviously not please bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired br br much complaining and <UNK> about god later bruce gets a page after a while he gets tired of it calling so he responds and goes to the <UNK> presents building <UNK> there he meets god freeman who is the boss <UNK> and janitor of the building i found this highly amusing god is the boss the holy spirit is the <UNK> and jesus christ is the janitor think about it boss obvious <UNK> the guy who keeps everything running janitor the guy who <UNK> up the mess that the world has left brilliant br br anyway bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met god but when god gives bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing god he starts to believe a bit wonder why enter the <UNK> abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies br br since this is hollywood bruce obviously eventually <UNK> up learns his lesson and starts using his powers for the good of the world in the end he cries out for god to take it away and <UNK> that his will be done not <UNK> br br since it is jim carrey the movie is quite amusing and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it the movie is not perfect <UNK> but for hollywood it is definitely a good attempt many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging and i applaud tom <UNK> for his effort in this movie br br so while far from perfect definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it br br bottom line 3 5 out of 4 worth a view or two
<START> the turning point in the <UNK> comes about half through the movie when danny an <UNK> man from denver is sitting in the balcony of his mexico city hotel enjoying a quiet moment someone knocks on his door and knowing it's julian the paid assassin he refuses to answer but did he really br br richard <UNK> the director of the <UNK> presents us with a character julian noble who shows no <UNK> qualities in fact we have already seen him in action doing what he does best when julian meets danny at the bar of the <UNK> real in mexico city he <UNK> the <UNK> and tells his new <UNK> what he really does for a living br br danny who has come to sell his program to a mexican company but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm <UNK> out by the smarter julian it's not until some time later on a cold winter night that the killer appears at <UNK> door asking his friend to <UNK> a favor and <UNK> him on a trip to <UNK> it's at this point that the secret that <UNK> them together is revealed in an unexpected way br br pierce brosnan acting against type makes a great contribution with his <UNK> julian noble just to watch him walking through the hotel <UNK> in his <UNK> and boots gives the right impression about his character greg kinnear on the other hand plays the straight part of this odd couple hope davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to <UNK> why didn't she stay longer philip baker hall puts an appearance as the <UNK> between julian and his <UNK> br br richard <UNK> directs with style working with his own material the musical score is by <UNK> kent and the crisp cinematography of david <UNK> enhances everything
<START> in this extremely low budget i've seen home movies made with better production value australian utter rip off of the burning friday the 13th a band is planning to make a music video while on a <UNK> they're stalked by a serial killer who was burned years before this movie is even <UNK> to be 'the worst australian film ever <UNK> in it's dvd <UNK> material that's it's only selling point complete and utter rubbish in every considerable way perhaps a few chuckles here and there for bad movie lovers but it still made me want to burn out my <UNK> br br eye candy a quick flash of barely existent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a lame shower scene br br my grade f
<START> i love this movie it is great film that combines english and indian cultures with feminist type issues such as girls wanting to play sports that were previously reserved for men it shows the struggles of both an indian person wanting to break outside her cultural <UNK> and women wanting to break outside the gender <UNK> found in sports especially in england at the time i feel that the cultural struggles are more <UNK> than the other issues br br in contrast to the other comment i do not think this movie is anything like dirty dancing or any other such chick flick this move is loved by many types of people men and women young and old alike
<START> an intriguing premise of hand drawn fantasy come to life in a child's fever dreams however i imagine the average <UNK> child is far more <UNK> at <UNK> themselves than bernard rose is at riveting the viewer the duel between <UNK> two realities drags on far too long to sustain interest especially considering that the little girl playing her is the most <UNK> child actor i've ever seen br br use only for <UNK>
<START> my mom and i have just recently become addicted to this show laughing our <UNK> off i've only seen about 10 episodes and i am disappointed that i didn't pay attention to this hilarious series before they were canceled the story line is very funny the characters really have great personalities or not so great but they're still funny i <UNK> every episode of what i like about you amanda <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as well as all of the cast never leave me bored while watching there is some <UNK> language for children and some sexual content but with a <UNK> guide near you shouldn't have too much problems there is some sort of <UNK> type of relationship that <UNK> me to this show i really enjoy it
<START> i wasn't really fond of the first cube movie it was a good idea but the annoying acting and characters always kept me from liking it too much didn't really feel the need to see its sequel but when i heard they were making a third movie that would act as more of a prequel to the original i was intrigued thinking that maybe they would fix some of the <UNK> problems and provide us with a memorable cast of characters well i thought wrong br br cube zero starts well enough by introducing us with the two characters in charge of watching and maintaining the never ending <UNK> of traps that <UNK> the people in the cube the filmmakers succeed in providing a sense of mystery with the establishment of the two men's daily routine several questions are created from it concerning the reason why people are send there and also the true nature of the ones who run the entire operation all of which are left entirely to the viewer the acting was a bit weak but all in all the movie's first half moved relatively well br br with the story moving on one of the two <UNK> begins to develop serious doubts about what he is doing and later decides to go and help a group of the people trapped here is where everything rapidly starts to <UNK> into dull cheese br br sent by the people who run the cube program we are introduced to the character <UNK> along with his two <UNK> play a major reason as to why this movie is failure to start of <UNK> looks and talks more like a third rate villain taken directly from a james bond movie complete with the ever popular glass eye that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the first <UNK> relatively nice pace whats more is that it begins to feel more like a comedy rather than a serious movie with some incredibly corny lines perhaps the screenwriter got bored and didn't care the acting itself <UNK> to a further low when the former watcher meets the group in the cube the entire interaction is painful to watch as is everything else following it br br again failing to impress on anything but weak characters dialog and acting cube zero is a waste of time for those searching for a good horror movie
<START> having seen the first ten episodes i must say this show sucks br br what bothers me the most is that the show was shot in canada i know it's cheaper but they should have shot it in california so we could have had scenes in the desert that would have been more true to the movie the first scene where they are outside in another world is in the mountains with lots of <UNK> where it looks cold that <UNK> feel very egyptian what worked so well in the movie was that it felt like you were in the ancient egypt here it feels like they're running around fighting aliens in a canadian forrest and it's so lame that <UNK> on other planets the fall comes as well you can see leaves on the ground in the <UNK> that all look like <UNK> outside <UNK> it just makes the show even more unbelievable and dumb br br and then there is richard dean anderson he is no kurt <UNK> sure he does a decent job and he tries to copy <UNK> performance a little bit but he is just not as cool as <UNK> and not nearly as good an actor as <UNK> and <UNK> way of playing o <UNK> well he was much more cynical <UNK> o neil is way too soft i liked it that <UNK> version just <UNK> give a s and had no trouble <UNK> the bomb until the very end of the movie br br michael <UNK> does a really good job as jackson though taking over from james <UNK> br br <UNK> is a really annoying character he is <UNK> not a <UNK> just <UNK> <UNK> a former bodyguard of a pathetic <UNK> character seen only in the pilot and in one other episode so far <UNK> speaks talks and acts like a robot i've seen better acting from jean claude van damme br br and the fact that <UNK> and the <UNK> character and the people they saved in the movie can speak english all of a sudden is also incredibly dumb what made the aliens so scary in the movie was that they spoke an ancient language and were real monsters br br as for the special effects they are really good in the pilot but the very rare effects in the actual show are badly done and looks cheap especially a planet they visit with <UNK> it's so obvious they walk around on a <UNK> with a badly made painting in the background it's an insult to us viewers that they made it look so cheap especially when they could have made it in front of a <UNK> with cgi backgrounds br br the x files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993 that was 4 years before sg 1 started and they <UNK> have the apparent two million dollar budget per episode that sg 1 supposedly had they must have spend all the money on <UNK> because i don't see it on the screen br br incredibly boring and pointless show that could have been great if they had shot the show in hollywood with a bigger budget and better writers and better characters
<START> the final film for <UNK> lubitsch completed by otto preminger after <UNK> <UNK> death during production is a <UNK> act of sophistication and silliness romance and music fantasy and costume <UNK> in a 19th century castle in <UNK> europe a <UNK> falls for her <UNK> enemy the leader of the hungarian revolt she's aided by her <UNK> whose painted image magically comes to life betty <UNK> in a long blonde wig <UNK> with flowers has never been more beautiful and her songs are very pleasant unfortunately this script by <UNK> <UNK> taken from an <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> and e <UNK> is <UNK> with different ideas that fail to <UNK> or entertain the results are good looking but <UNK> 1 2 from

<START> when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television we've all been guilty of it at some time or another but my excuse for watching things like buck rogers in the <UNK> century and silver <UNK> is this i was young and naive ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhile br br thankfully i now appreciate the good stuff stargate sg 1 is not good the 12 year old me would love every hackneyed bit of it every line of stilted dialogue every bit of needless <UNK> the writing is beyond insipid so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek voyager if your show makes me long for the worst trek show ever you're in trouble br br the film stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure <UNK> by two solid performances by james <UNK> and kurt russell full of fascinating egyptian architecture and culture a wonderful musical score and cool sci fi ideas with the exception of a little of the original music none of what made the film fun appears in this show even richard dean anderson who made <UNK> watchable and legend interesting seems like he's half asleep most episodes br br the budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like <UNK> basement the cinematography isn't much better as vanilla and dull as the scripts it <UNK> me that shows with a lot more style like <UNK> and substance like the <UNK> battlestar galactica have smaller less <UNK> <UNK> than this <UNK> it just doesn't deserve it
<START> this film is so bad it made me want to vomit poorly produced a complete laugh free zone why in the name of god would you spoof a movie which to a degree is a spoof and a damn funny one at that as it stands the sets are laughable the effects so bad that they aren't even laughable and the acting <UNK> it is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this <UNK> of garbage national lampoon once made animal house which people still consider to be completely and utterly hilarious now they've been <UNK> to making tv movies like this <UNK> of name your <UNK> and it could be accurately used to describe this film
<START> i gave this a four purely out of its historical context it was considered lost for many years until it popped up out of the blue on showtime in the early nineties br br moe is the straight man and larry and curly act as a duo spade <UNK> has a couple of numbers i guess it had something to do with working on a ranch i'm not quite sure because the plot was so minimal nothing really sticks in my memory i vaguely remember it being a western musical comedy even the <UNK> seem to be going through the motions overall there's nothing much really to recommend here br br if you're not a <UNK> fan then don't bother if you are a <UNK> fan then stick with the shorts
<START> i liked this movie i remember there was one very well done scene in this movie where riff <UNK> played by p j soles is lying in her bed smoking pot and then she begins to <UNK> that the ramones are in the room with her sing the song i want you around very very cool stuff br br it was fun energetic quirky and cool yes i'll admit that the ending is way way over the top and far fetched but it doesn't matter because it is fun this is a very fun movie it's sex pot and rock n <UNK> forever br br i read that cheap trick was the band who was originally to star in this but i do not know if this is true or not
<START> eddie murphy is one of the funniest comedians ever probably the funniest delirious is the best stand up comedy i've ever seen and it is a must have for anyone who loves a good laugh i've watched this movie hundreds of times and every time i see it i still have side splitting fun this is definitely one for your video library i guarantee that you will have to watch it several times in order to hear all the jokes because you will be laughing so much that you will miss half of them delirious is hilarious br br although there are a lot of funny comedians out there after watching this stand up comedy most of them will seem like second class citizens if you have never seen it get it watch it and you will love it it will make you <UNK>
<START> this film is really unbelievable i've seen so much cheap trash movies especially a lot <UNK> <UNK> pictures but <UNK> is really hard so much comes together the laughable story the actors always at the edge of parody and the special effects how long i could talk about them it is a really bad movie but also one of the funniest ones if you're a fan of bad movies to laugh about you have to see it and don't miss <UNK> vs demonic <UNK> it really funnier and worse
<START> i've been a fan since his first album this film is a <UNK> to him the performances except for one by <UNK> <UNK> and teddy thompson are simply terrible br br those by martha <UNK> nick cave <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were particularly annoying even the one by the <UNK> sisters was ruined by the so called harmony of martha <UNK> br br i've never seen my wife get up and walk out of the room on a film before and i found myself fast <UNK> through the performances to get to the few interview segments which were also difficult to watch due to the poor camera work br br there are many who have been able to interpret mr <UNK> songs jennifer <UNK> <UNK> lang billy joel aaron <UNK> and willie nelson come to mind but those people selected for this performance were just awful br br hopefully there will be another attempt at capturing leonard cohen on film that will illustrate his insight talent and intelligence br br so sad
<START> set in world depression era <UNK> this is the story of an ambitious store clerk who is falling in love with a mystery woman with whom he has <UNK> romantic letters only to discover that the mystery woman is none other than the sales girl from his shop who seems to be constantly <UNK> with the colleague add a little twist the owner is convinced that his favorite employee stewart is having an affair with the <UNK> wife leaving stewart briefly <UNK> along with an admission that the sales girl <UNK> stewart all along the happy ending is inevitable br br although very dated references to poverty and i have a wife and two kids to consider are over used along with the indication that many small objects of pleasure like a musical <UNK> box are out of reach for common people's enjoyment this film is much more effective and more credible than the 1990s re make you've got mail in the re make starring tom hanks and meg ryan the actual odds of the chain of events are so unbelievable that the viewer's intelligence is grossly offended br br shop around the corner is an innocent <UNK> down memory lane into a less complicated less <UNK> and more romantic time and place known as a <UNK> <UNK> lovers of classic romantic comedies will enjoy this picture
<START> ed <UNK> work in this film is up to his usual standard of excellence that is he steals the screen away from anyone with whom he shares it and that includes the <UNK> sean connery the movie which is more than a bit <UNK> comes alive only in the scenes when harris is <UNK> by the attorney for another convict it is breathtaking a master class in artistic control br br the other cast members are all <UNK> and connery is reliable as is <UNK> but the story itself packs no <UNK> the plot depends largely on the premise that a black prisoner always will be <UNK> and <UNK> by white law <UNK> officers this is the engine which drives the story right or wrong and makes one feel a tad cheated at the end br br still worth watching to see harris in action
<START> i had not seen this movie since the late '80s and decided to pick up the vhs version of it the plot is very slow and the actors almost seem robotic in this <UNK> flick the music hip hop <UNK> artists and the <UNK> scenes are what make this movie special the <UNK> is actually better in this movie than in <UNK> but i have to say that <UNK> 1 2 carry the energy excitement to the screen a lot better it's a movie i will keep in my library but it's not a movie that i can watch over over again just once in a blue moon
<START> i saw this movie at a <UNK> <UNK> and i must honestly confess that i do not like films with meryl streep that much this picture was the worst half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film i <UNK> blame them if this wasn't a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture just before the film goes forward in time about ten years i myself was expecting the credits to appear
<START> fear of a black hat is a hilarious spoof of hip hop culture it is just as funny as this is spinal tap if not funnier the actors are incredible and the documentary style is superb mark christopher lawrence is a tremendous talent that should be starring in a lot more films this film is a true cult classic
<START> bruce <UNK> will <UNK> the academy awards with a record 14 oscar wins it will <UNK> <UNK> as the highest <UNK> film of all time jim <UNK> <UNK> will be at such a supreme level that he will <UNK> his presidential <UNK> for the 2004 white house <UNK> almighty then these <UNK> fantasies would only <UNK> if the filmmakers carrey included would possess the powers of god that very same premise is the paramount <UNK> in <UNK> new laugh riot bruce <UNK> carrey plays bruce nolan a <UNK> reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds god to total <UNK> for his own <UNK> god heavenly played by morgan freeman <UNK> bruce the gift of <UNK> his powers in order to challenge him if he can do god's job any better obviously bruce gets <UNK> away with his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and uses them <UNK> carrey is back in his <UNK> almighty comedic form in bruce <UNK> jennifer aniston was not <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> girlfriend however my <UNK> kudos goes to director tom <UNK> for not letting the dog out of the house for 2 and showing us the most hilarious <UNK> bathroom scene of all time bruce <UNK> is not the most in depth carrey film but it is still an almighty <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> good
<START> this has to be the worst and i mean worst biker movie ever made and that's saying a lot because the line of <UNK> is long and <UNK> br br now at least we know what happened to ginger after she was rescued from <UNK> island a frightened looking tina louise she was probably afraid someone would see this mess is a stranded <UNK> who is tormented by the most repulsive motorcycle gang in film history but don't worry fans batman i mean adam west as a <UNK> town doctor comes to the rescue <UNK> crush boom holy <UNK> batman br br the only good points of this bomb are some cute women some laughable fight scenes and the still sexy tina louise
<START> my mom took me to see this movie when it came out around christmas of 1976 i loved it then and i love it now i know everyone makes fun of <UNK> hair in this one but i think she looks and sounds great and i seem to remember a number of women who copied that <UNK> look at the time also the bath <UNK> scene between streisand and <UNK> is just so sexy the music is great as well this is the <UNK> 70's <UNK> at her best
<START> my wife kate and i absolutely loved the series and can't wait for the next one hopefully there is a sequel i would love to know what the catchy song is called and who wrote it maybe because i am old and grey and still interested in life if anyone has the full lyrics please send them br br of course one big reason why my wife and i liked this series so much was that we are 75 years old and retired but still very active intellectually it's great to see a show that highlights the contribution to society that can still be made by older people with special skills and experience the human interest aspect showing the interactions of the characters and the younger people around them is an important part of the show br br this series is highly entertaining and very sophisticated on a par with some of our other favourites <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> strange how less than 2 hours can seem like a lifetime when sitting through such flat uninspiring drivel if a story is as personal as this supposedly was to sally potter wouldn't you expect a little passion to show through in her performance her acting was completely detached and i felt no chemistry between sally and <UNK> and the tango scenes which should have been fiery given the nature of the dance were instead awkward and painful to watch obviously revealing such a personal story on film can be <UNK> and as such sally potter would have been wise to let a better actor take on the task rather than let her passion fall victim to her own <UNK>
<START> i have to admit that i went into fever pitch with low expectations it's no huge revelation for me to say that jimmy <UNK> last movie taxi was <UNK> bad and the trailers for fever pitch were all right but didn't <UNK> me i was already preparing some cheesy baseball <UNK> for my review br br i like jimmy fallon but taxi was strike one in his movie career well now we've got <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> one more strike and it's back to snl or buy yourself some <UNK> and cracker <UNK> but don't buy tickets to fever pitch you'll walk out of the theater and never go back then the movie had to go and be way more entertaining than i was expecting but hey i couldn't let my <UNK> go to waste right another reason i thought i wouldn't care for the movie is that i hate the boston red sox my whole family hates 'em the mere mention of <UNK> <UNK> name sends me running to the bathroom oh man hold on br br all right i'm back anyway my mom who is a st louis <UNK> fan still believes the world series was <UNK> last year she refuses to believe the sox won it <UNK> but i'm man enough to admit that fever pitch caused me to sympathize albeit only slightly with the plight of red sox fans br br anybody who has a passion for sports will be able to relate to this movie on some level unless you have a favorite sports team you can't fully understand the extreme <UNK> and <UNK> that a fan such as <UNK> ben can go through there's nothing quite so fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing quite so smooth as a clean <UNK> well <UNK> speaking it's the joy of being a sports fan wait <UNK> next year becomes your <UNK> your <UNK> your <UNK> and fever pitch effectively captures that essence br br i love the fact that the movie takes a fictional story and throws it against the real life backdrop of the red <UNK> improbable world series run last year i don't love it so much that i want to marry it but you know what i mean i expected this to be handled in a fairly cheesy manner and while some of the humor is a little silly it's actually pretty realistic br br you see ben's uncle took him to his first red sox game when he was 7 years old and when he died he left ben his two season tickets ben hasn't missed a game in 23 years at the beginning of each season he has a draft day where he and his friends get together to figure out who gets to go to which games with him he makes everybody dance for the <UNK> games and whenever somebody complains he threatens them with tickets for the games with the <UNK> sorry mr <UNK> and the devil <UNK> it's a very good scene and it works so well because i actually know of people who do the ticket draft day i also must admit that i can relate to when ben goes to dinner with lindsey and her parents the red sox are playing a road game but instead of watching it live on tv ben decides to tape it one of the most dangerous things in life is <UNK> a game and then being in public and trying to avoid hearing the result been there it's a very tense and scary situation <UNK> ben enters the danger zone when a guy shows up at the restaurant and mentions watching the game ben immediately covers his ears and starts <UNK> like a <UNK> so as not to hear the outcome lindsey is embarrassed and her parents don't know what to think yeah sports fans can be weird i don't deny it but it's real br br now if you're expecting the crude edgy stuff that the <UNK> brothers are known for then you could be disappointed they do have their moments though like when ben says he likes how lindsey sometimes talks out of the side of her mouth like an adorable stroke victim but overall this is definitely a <UNK> more romantic side that the bros are putting on display br br that's not to say that the movie ever gets way too sappy thankfully when the <UNK> starts to <UNK> a bit the <UNK> know when to pull away a romantic moment with lindsey jumping on the field and running over to ben to <UNK> her <UNK> love for him turns into ben sincerely <UNK> you've gotta tell me about the <UNK> is it <UNK> jimmy fallon proves that with the right material he can handle himself well on the big screen and drew barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm fever pitch is just good solid entertainment that takes a somewhat fresh look at the romantic comedy genre it's a movie that guys and <UNK> can both relate to particularly the guys who practice sports <UNK> at some point during the year and the ladies who must deal with 'em br br now if the red sox fans could please shut up about the curse of the <UNK> i would appreciate it my <UNK> <UNK> have never won the <UNK> basketball championship so i officially <UNK> my plight greater than yours br br the <UNK> fans of jimmy fallon drew barrymore romantic comedy the red sox baseball or sports <UNK> in general should consider giving fever pitch a look i wouldn't go out of my way to rush and see it at the first available time but it'll make a great <UNK> br br rating 3 25 out of 5
<START> here is the example of a film that was not well received when it was made but whose standing seems to be raising in time 'the <UNK> is quite an interesting work by polanski one of the first of his european <UNK> it is set in paris and as in so many other <UNK> films the city its streets the <UNK> and especially the building where the action takes place play an important role it is just that polanski chooses his principal character not to be an american as in <UNK> for example but a pole as himself was when going west there is actually a lot of personal commentary in this film made at what must have been a time of crisis in the director's life and the fact that he decided to play the lead role and does it masterfully may also be seen as some kind of <UNK> br br it's in a way a <UNK> story the hero named <UNK> <UNK> an apartment in old <UNK> building inhabited by what seem to be first a well <UNK> team of grumpy old or just ridiculous neighbors the previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of the flat and <UNK> has just the time to visit her in the hospital before she dies and meet there her young and beautiful friend stella a <UNK> isabelle <UNK> in her first role after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> h ' soon the neighbors do not seem to be what they are it's a conspiracy to make him crazy or to make him enter the life and role of the dead girl he fights tries to run enters the game and ends by entering the circle and slowly becoming her the circle is closed br br it's not the most believable story we may have seen or heard but the strength of the film does not <UNK> in the story but in the details of the psychology in the slow <UNK> of the mental state of the hero in the permanent <UNK> game between reality and <UNK> to a certain extent it is not what happens on the screen that matters but how it happens reminding the classical <UNK> in the <UNK> made more than a decade before at the end of the polish period of polanski there are many details that are never explained but then this is how mystery films must be and this is actually how life is sometimes the feeling of <UNK> slowly <UNK> the viewer unfortunately some of the <UNK> details in the last part of the film are not too well executed and the english spoken dialogs the film was made in english almost <UNK> the overall atmosphere however waiting for the final punch scene is very worth the patience br br it's not the best film that polanski made yet has many good parts it shows the hand and the style of the director and was a significant step in the building of his career
<START> it's interesting to see what shape pierce <UNK> career was in before bond arrived on the scene in this tense thriller pierce brosnan plays the gentle patrick who works leading ghetto kids on confidence <UNK> he romances a woman who has a <UNK> standard <UNK> top mid 90s kid called eric the woman's drunken ex husband soon arrives on the scene and begins to mess with pierce br br at one stage pierce is <UNK> making <UNK> the husband enters pierce <UNK> making <UNK> the husband then <UNK> pierce little <UNK> of half eaten <UNK> call fall from <UNK> mouth the fight abruptly ends without showing the outcome this is as good as the film gets br br
<START> i love this show period i haven't been watching very long probably only about six months or so actually but it is now my favorite show and probably will be for quite a while i love all of the characters except i don't really care for donna i'm not completely sure why i just don't find her funny and i don't think laura <UNK> is a very good actress other than her i find the rest of the cast pretty good <UNK> smith and debra joe <UNK> who played <UNK> parents were extremely funny <UNK> grace is also a great actor unlike a lot of fans i did not completely hate the <UNK> season i still watch it and it does make me laugh but if you compare it to the shows earlier seasons its not good randy is horrible the finale was decent nothing amazing but good i do think it would have been better to <UNK> the show after <UNK> and <UNK> decided to leave but oh well i have the fourth season on dvd and someday i hope to have all eight seasons on dvd some of its most hilarious episodes in my opinion were <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> but i love every episode i've seen so far which is most of them i think 9 10 stars i would definitely recommend it
<START> i don't know what some of you are smoking but i suspect it's potent br br to call swept away awful would be an insult to the very concept of <UNK> the acting is hideous and i'm not picking on madonna here we all know she's useless but someone should have warned everyone else that her <UNK> is <UNK> my back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered lines the editing is so sloppy it <UNK> description the photography and composition which in this era <UNK> should be a given for any film with a budget are astonishingly inept even the lighting is horrid and unnatural looking these are basic elements of filmmaking if you can't get them right you should seek another line of work it's as contrived as a grade 3 production of snow white except nowhere near as well made or interesting br br the original film by <UNK> <UNK> is a wonderful satire and metaphor superbly acted and written featuring breathtaking visuals you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the <UNK> sand in your hair the sexual tension feels real and immediate those of you who found guy <UNK> version <UNK> should see it it really is one of the <UNK> of world cinema br br those of you who thought the remake is some kind of masterpiece should have your heads examined
<START> magic isn't too strong a word for the spell this film weaves you find yourself relaxing and seeing others in a more <UNK> light any movie that has that <UNK> an effect on viewers deserves serious attention seldom are we <UNK> in beauty like this as if that weren't enough it's funny performances are without exception extraordinary but special mention must be made of the <UNK> miranda richardson and the superb <UNK> walker both open like <UNK> br br why isn't this film on dvd it deserves to live forever
<START> this is another typical unbelievable and non <UNK> piece of hollywood dreck br br kurt russell as snake <UNK> in a business suit convinces me he was a better 2nd <UNK> ray liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd <UNK> <UNK> is her usual cardboard self and does little to be a convincing victim br br every scene in this <UNK> is absolutely predictable all the way to the end when kurt <UNK> ray with a <UNK> or something knocking him down and out kurt and <UNK> then do their obligatory end of the movie embrace and everybody except russell and <UNK> knows liotta is going to get back up and menace the couple again br br he does of course and russell <UNK> him 10 times with his <UNK> which was entirely unnecessary this movie could just as well ended with the <UNK> scene except hollywood <UNK> on unnecessary violence and the more they can add or enhance the more <UNK> they get
<START> my son was 7 years old when he saw this movie he is now on a russian fishing <UNK> and said that the movie he was most impressed with and that has <UNK> in his mind all of these <UNK> years is the movie of the legend of the boy and the eagle he has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him i am sure that a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract <UNK> since we have indian blood he <UNK> to this movie on january <UNK> he will turn <UNK> years old and i would like to be able to obtain this movie for him he lives in thailand and has been a commercial <UNK> for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs can you help me obtain this movie <UNK> you in advance <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> beach <UNK>
<START> i honestly can't believe what passes for entertainment now death and making fun of death violence sexual innuendo adults threatening children <UNK> alcohol abuse by <UNK> drug <UNK> dysfunctional parents babysitter from hell stereotypical jokes about african americans police and fat people and kids <UNK> out of the house in the middle of the night <UNK> sure sounds like a kids movie to me not add to that the dark and scary elements a dead woman <UNK> and turning into a house and keeping her loving husband a prisoner inside for over 20 years and also <UNK> an entire neighborhood how sweet for kids parents is this really what you want your kids to be watching is this what you want to teach them about life br br this movie is too scary for young kids and i'm afraid that teens today may be living some of this movie scenario so why rub it in their faces as for an adult audience you won't find it scary or amusing just boring contrived and predictable and the characters are just wrong clueless parents ignorant police stupid and annoying friends nasty and manipulative <UNK> and beer drinking <UNK> boyfriends what great material for kids does this really sound like a children's movie to anyone even the computer animation and good voice work aren't enough to redeem this terrible flick save your money save your time and save your children's minds go rent ice age monsters inc the <UNK> shrek a bug's life any of them are way better than this horrid film spielberg and <UNK> shame on both of you for making such a disaster and then billing it as a children's family movie
<START> trying to <UNK> of something as insipid as the sentinel would be pretty difficult the problems are many the result is terrible and loaded with plot holes br br michael douglas stars as pete <UNK> a secret service agent who took one for reagan during the attempt on his life years later we find pete assigned to the <UNK> family mainly as a guard for the first lady kim basinger l a <UNK> troubles <UNK> as we see <UNK> close involvement with the first lady and a sudden threat against the president himself david <UNK> united <UNK> when pete fails a <UNK> test he's <UNK> out as a disgruntled agent by investigator david <UNK> <UNK> sutherland 24 tv series br br as the presidential assassination plot unfolds pete finds himself on the run from his own people his only <UNK> is the first lady and she's reluctant to tell anyone about their affections for one another which is why pete failed the <UNK> in the first place but is pete really innocent or is he simply trying to buy time until he can kill the president if he is innocent how can he help prevent the assassination attempt while running from the secret service br br the one big overwhelming problem with this film is that there's no justification for the reason behind the presidential threat isn't that what the movie's supposed to be about one would think so but the audience is never let in on why the assassin s want to kill the <UNK> hmm someone forget to put that in the script somewhere br br and what's with david <UNK> <UNK> new partner jill <UNK> eva longoria <UNK> way seems that she was put in the film strictly as a piece of a candy what was her purpose again did she do anything other than look nice in tight pants and a low cut <UNK> br br there are so many problems with the basic premise of the sentinel as to be laughable the action is too easily <UNK> by the what the <UNK> sure to be <UNK> by those unfortunate enough to watch the movie
<START> although i have enjoyed bing crosby in other movies i find this movie to be particularly grating maybe because i'm from a different era and a different country but i found <UNK> <UNK> references to the good old usa pleasant at first trite after a while and then finally annoying don't get me wrong i'm not anti american whatsoever but it seemed that the english could do no right and or needed this brave oh so smart american visitor to show them the way it's a fish out of water story but unlike most movies of this sort this time it's the fish who has the upper hand to be fair to both myself and the movie i have watched it a few times <UNK> over a few years and get the same impression each time br br i watched another crosby movie last night the <UNK> <UNK> and that too produced the same reaction in me and to my surprise even my wife who for what's it's worth is american found the in your face attitude of american crosby to be irritating one too many references to teddy <UNK> as she put it br br as for the premise of the movie it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good the scenery and the music is also good as are the great costumes although i agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on william <UNK> looks horrid picture moe of the three stooges br br all in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of bing crosby but because he is in virtually every shot it's pretty hard to sit through this movie
<START> after i watched the films i thought why the heck was this film such a high success in the korean box office even thought the movie had a clever <UNK> scenario the acting wasn't that good and the characters weren't very interesting for a korean movie i liked the fighting scenes if you want to watch a film without thinking this is the film for you but i got to admit the film was kind of childish 6 10
<START> all this <UNK> waste of film stock needs is count <UNK> popping up every sixty seconds somehow they got steve <UNK> susan <UNK> john <UNK> and joe <UNK> together on a set and couldn't get within five miles about eight <UNK> of an actual movie boy does this thing suck there isn't one original line thought shot or effect from brainless opening sequence to brainless close the magical <UNK> susan <UNK> of five easy pieces boring steve <UNK> boring john <UNK> boring the big bug boring if this is a scary movie <UNK> gang is a <UNK> documentary br br seriously every bad movie contains its own explanation of its badness usually it's in the opening credits written directed and produced by one guy or at the very center of the action is some bimbo so talentless that you know there's one and only one reason this turkey got made here you don't find out till the very last of the credits where the <UNK> of about a dozen <UNK> of the canadian government is <UNK> acknowledged br br right now i'm watching <UNK> take on beast of <UNK> <UNK> to get the taste out of my mouth <UNK> what an improvement
<START> who knew <UNK> queen victoria the <UNK> <UNK> who was a virtual <UNK> for 40 years after the death of her husband prince albert actually led a life <UNK> with drama and intrigue in her younger days 'the young <UNK> not only chronicles the young <UNK> romance with her husband to be but also does a pretty good job of <UNK> the political <UNK> surrounding her <UNK> to the throne br br the act i <UNK> <UNK> draws you in right away following the death of victoria's father the duke of kent in <UNK> less than a year after victoria's birth the <UNK> of kent eventually hooked up with former army officer john <UNK> who offered his services as <UNK> to the widow and her <UNK> queen to be <UNK> insisted that victoria be raised under the atrocious <UNK> <UNK> rules designed to prevent the future queen from having any contact with other children while growing up what's more victoria was forced to sleep in her mother's bedroom everyday until she became queen br br the film explains that in <UNK> <UNK> passed the <UNK> act which established that victoria's mother would become <UNK> and hence guardian in the event that victoria <UNK> to the throne while still a minor during this time the

throne victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of <UNK> whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable they were both <UNK> to a secluded apartment in <UNK> palace and for a number of years victoria had little contact with her mother br br 'the young <UNK> conveys the excitement and <UNK> and <UNK> surrounding victoria's <UNK> as queen a good part of the film deals with victoria's relationship with lord melbourne the <UNK> party prime minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was in the beginning melbourne <UNK> the young <UNK> trust and they become good friends in the early years of her reign she sees melbourne as a <UNK> but later loses respect for him somewhat as he's revealed to be a typical politician hiding his contempt for the masses whom he's supposed to be <UNK> in reality melbourne was more a father figure to victoria but the film hints at some sexual tension between the prime minister and prince albert as though they were romantic rivals br br the plot <UNK> when melbourne is forced out and the queen must <UNK> sir robert <UNK> of the more conservative <UNK> party as the new prime minister the film chronicles the events of 'the <UNK> <UNK> in which <UNK> <UNK> after victoria refused to replace some of her <UNK> ladies with the wives of <UNK> politicians the film leaves out another scandal which involved a lady <UNK> one of the <UNK> ladies in waiting who was accused of having an affair with john <UNK> and becoming pregnant by him because of her hatred for <UNK> victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about <UNK> alleged <UNK> as it turned out <UNK> only appeared <UNK> she actually had was an <UNK> <UNK> victoria's <UNK> shows during the <UNK> crisis but the film's <UNK> ignore some of the more <UNK> aspects of her character as <UNK> by the <UNK> affair br br the rest of the 'the young <UNK> deals with of course the romance between the queen and prince albert victoria kept albert waiting as the film makes clear since she wanted to <UNK> herself to her duties as the new <UNK> they spent a good deal of time <UNK> with one another until albert returned to england and gave victoria support during the trying times of the <UNK> crisis br br i find a good number of parallels between prince albert and prince philip the current <UNK> husband while philip is mainly danish he went to school in germany and had in laws who were of german background both albert and philip made it their business to <UNK> <UNK> in the court there's a great scene where albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for king george iii even though he had been dead for years <UNK> struggle was the same for <UNK> husbands of <UNK> they had to find something to do both albert and philip became involved in various <UNK> projects and proved that they didn't have to live continually in the shadow of their ever popular wives br br fortunately there's an excellent scene toward the end of the film where albert <UNK> victoria with what she <UNK> as his <UNK> in her affairs albert doesn't want a second <UNK> <UNK> so he goes over his wife's head and <UNK> a compromise involving victoria's <UNK> ladies victoria is barely talking to albert when an <UNK> bullets almost cuts them both down in the film albert is shot in the arm but this never happened br br the performances in the film are uniformly excellent especially the principals emily blunt and rupert friend the young victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward <UNK> no mention of victoria's depression after <UNK> death but <UNK> is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson
<START> not sure why this film was advertised as a wild quirky laugh filled comedy there is not much in this movie that will entertain nor <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whose acting was <UNK> as being oscar worthy comes off here as mannered with her performance seeming routine brian <UNK> character is confusing and irritating and the lead playing <UNK> ¬ñ joseph cross ¬ñ appears to simply not have the personality to carry his role the best thing about the film is <UNK> rachel wood but she is not enough to <UNK> this boring <UNK> film br br the film disappeared quickly and it seems with good reason i found some of the scenes <UNK> the scene with brian cox and his just <UNK> toilet rivals some of the worst scenes in <UNK> and me and everyone we <UNK> and 'the <UNK> and the <UNK> some embarrassing and most of them unsettling i found the whole experience a waste of time don't you waste your <UNK>
<START> richard brooks excellent 1967 film of truman <UNK> novel in cold blood is a perfect companion piece to philip seymour <UNK> oscar winning performance in the 2005 capote they really play well together try them on separate nights it is unusual to find films made <UNK> years apart that <UNK> so well these two truly enhance each other even though different actors play the roles of killers perry smith and dick <UNK> the two pieces blend well only the part of the writer played by paul stewart in the brooks films is weaker as they give him a different name then capote i'd suggest watching capote first followed by in cold blood it makes for a powerful experience
<START> the only words you need fear more than joe don baker if your thinking of watching a film are <UNK> clark and if they are both there run for your life however this is a very funny film because they actually take themselves seriously it starts out bad and goes downhill from there repeated scenes the good the bad and the ugly like shootout will have you rolling on the floor with laughter yes he's the best deputy sheriff in texas tracking a mafia hit man to <UNK> as only he can he makes his own rules does things his own way all the while wearing cowboy boots and <UNK> cowboy style you want to see a bad but funny film go ahead on its your move
<START> director vincenzo <UNK> cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller which although <UNK> some suspension of belief and plenty of concentration manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience br br morgan sullivan jeremy northam a stay at home husband with an overbearing wife decides to add a bit of spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at high tech company <UNK> <UNK> his job is to travel to <UNK> across the country under the assumed identity of jack <UNK> and secretly broadcast the speeches given back to his bosses via a nifty little electronic pen <UNK> br br in reality however the speeches are merely a cover for far more <UNK> activities morgan along with his fellow <UNK> <UNK> is being <UNK> the drugged water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma during which they are told to forget their <UNK> and <UNK> adopt their new identities once they are totally convinced that they are someone else they are told to apply for jobs with rival companies where they are able to <UNK> in corporate espionage without suspicion br br but <UNK> <UNK> plans are <UNK> by the <UNK> of shady <UNK> for hire rita foster lucy liu who opens <UNK> eyes to what is really happening she gives morgan an <UNK> to the mind <UNK> drugs so that he can resist the <UNK> techniques she also warns him that if <UNK> <UNK> suspects that he does not fully believe he is jack <UNK> then he will be <UNK> morgan plays along and applies for a job at rival business <UNK> br br however arriving at his new <UNK> he is given a <UNK> test and is immediately <UNK> as a spy fortunately the bosses at <UNK> see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to <UNK> <UNK> and morgan becomes a double agent br br from <UNK> in things get <UNK> more complicated the plot twists and turns and poor old morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone in an exciting finale all eventually becomes clear but only if you've been following events very carefully br br director natali handles proceedings <UNK> and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy looking film for a relatively low budget he manages to get some great performances from his talented cast jeremy northam in particular is <UNK> portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous morgan is played to perfection br br cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to take chances and i eagerly look forward to his <UNK> projects high rise and <UNK>
<START> my first question after seeing this film was why is the title liam if the intent was to tell a story from the boy's perspective it was not carried out well of course there was the formulaic use of camera angles in the boy's scenes but much of the crucial action took place outside of his field of view having a main character unable to speak obviously suggesting the mute <UNK> position of a child makes it difficult to give that character much depth br br melodrama is defined as dramatic or other literary work <UNK> by the use of stereotyped characters exaggerated emotions and language simplistic morality and conflict liam fits this definition to a t the viewer is hit over the head with the typical stereotypes of the fire and <UNK> catholic church in the stern school <UNK> and the well fed priest <UNK> money from <UNK> a stereotype which is becoming very tiresome what's more the jewish characters are money <UNK> and factory owners br br much of the film was predictable who didn't think that we'd see <UNK> <UNK> the toilet after her mother had told her no daughter of mine will <UNK> another woman's toilet i'm a fan of british realism if it's done well in my opinion liam is not br br
<START> wow br br i picked this up at the local wal mart after reading online that it had been released early i've been following this online for some time and just had to buy the film br br wow br br i guess the thing that really struck me was the editing or lack thereof time and again characters usually the narrator and whoever he is with are shown walking and walking and walking i am not an editor but i do know that you can cut between someone leaving point a to show them arriving at point b there is no need to show almost the entire journey wow br br i actually ended up feeling somewhat sorry for the actors involved in this they seem to have been given no direction as to what to do during scenes other than to look scared or look happy depending on what action was to be added at a later date br br wow br br why it was decided to do almost all the effects using cg is beyond me even <UNK> still employs <UNK> sometimes one of the most distracting uses of green screen in this film is the constant <UNK> about of according to the end credits the same group of people representing the <UNK> of different towns and cities including london at times these folk are coming and going with no regard as to the angle of the shot or the distance they are from the camera in one shot in london there appear to be at least two men over six feet tall walking just behind the <UNK> brother played by star anthony <UNK> without his distracting mustache not since <UNK> have i seen such a fake piece of facial hair br br wow br br why timothy hines talked up this film the way he did is beyond me it is a turkey plain and simple on the plus side at least for me it has provided some of the most genuine laugh out loud bits of hilarity i have seen in quite a while
<START> i watched this movie because i like nicolas cage and well i found it strange and completely pointless so i decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it wow what a difference the original one was way better i'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement it's existence did have a purpose it was really the christian public expressing their fear of <UNK> if you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but i don't want to go into details just simply put if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it should look like feel free to watch the 70s version a little dated but a lot better
<START> now for the truth its very very weak storyline for a walt disney film its total rubbish when the robinson appear the films all over the place i was shocked how poor it was it like alice in wonderland gone wrong it feels like they were short on ideas some <UNK> some crazy rubbish together to try and get away with it and they don't after that i sat there wishing for the end my younger brother lost interest half way through and was confused by the story the characters are weak and after the <UNK> appear you don't care about the ending you just want the film to finish its a film to forget and forget quickly if you've got some spare time don't waste it on this
<START> i had the pleasure of viewing this beautiful film last night with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director following the viewing i suspect that the first <UNK> has never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death i have had many such <UNK> and this movie spoke to me one of the major themes is how we don't deal with questions issues stories with our loved ones until it's too late they're too <UNK> or dead before that happens talk to your loved ones listen to and record their stories tell people you love them resolve differences i loved the message that there are no mistakes i love the director's portrayal of the relationship of the two daughters as one of six siblings it's clear to me he understood how complex those relationships are his history as a cinematographer also comes through loud and clear what a beautiful movie the casting is outstanding a film not to be missed
<START> it's always nice to see angela <UNK> getting to do a role that she can really sink her teeth into she is at times intense funny and even sexy in her role as lena a colored woman forced to make a home on a desolate <UNK> just outside of cape town south africa danny glover is also good in a not entirely sympathetic role as her partner <UNK> willie <UNK> gives a finely nuanced performance as the stranger that discovers <UNK> and <UNK> new living area it's not often that you get a chance to see an intelligent film dealing with mature themes although it is based on a play the late director john <UNK> who also directed <UNK> opens the material up by having the film shot in the widescreen <UNK> format he also keeps things visually interesting through the creative <UNK> of actors and by showing us things only mentioned in the play just like <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> john <UNK> may have directed angela <UNK> into an academy award nomination this is definitely a film worth searching for
<START> i've spent years looking for a copy of this film <UNK> dvd vhs so i could show it to my kids the movie is funny and spike and the members of his band show why they were the best musicians in the business they had to be that good to play that demented i like it and recommend it for movie lovers of all ages br br the movie is about a turn of the century <UNK> with a crew of <UNK> that are <UNK> and the department band when not fighting the fires there's the usual running gags plus the mayhem of spike jones and his orchestra also comedy relief provided by comedian buddy <UNK> and straight man hugh o'brien
<START> this movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in ask the dust colin farrell is usually a fine actor but in this he is juvenile donald sutherland comes across as an amateur why because the script is awful the adaptation is awful and the actors seem bored and half hearted the atmosphere of the movie is bad i could only think when it would finish and i turned it off half way the director has done a very poor job and even though i have not read the novel it is certainly a missed chance the atmosphere this film is trying to evoke and the message and storyline never reaches the audience in one word it is a terrible film
<START> this was a great movie but it had the worst ending i think i have ever seen the actors were great and displayed wonderful talent the entire story was twisted and <UNK> which is what made it entertaining as good as the movie was the entire film is judged by the ending which was terrible maybe a sequel could eliminate this bad ending
<START> <UNK> <UNK> 2000 <UNK> kevin <UNK> br br believed to be <UNK> cruella de <UNK> close is released from prison and sets out to make a new start in life things are going well for cruella who is busy helping homeless dogs off the street when the clock strikes on big ben things turn bad the hypnotic cure is <UNK> and cruella is back and this time she is determined to make that spotted coat she always wanted br br glenn close <UNK> her role as cruella de <UNK> and once again is the highlight of the film every scene with her in is worth watching in this dull sequel which feels more of a repeat of the previous film rather than a new story br br she's changed ¬ñ ken <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> rarely do i see a film that i am totally <UNK> with this was one of them it had good acting dialogue plot and the scenery was beautiful i laughed out loud many times especially the scene dealing with the kitchen raid the slapstick comedy performed by the <UNK> hired hand had me one the floor but i admit that i am a sucker for slapstick the story dealt with a group of people in their 30's coming back to a summer camp that they had attended 20 years previously it was a farewell week of camping as the place would be closed down <UNK> at the end of the season as adults the camp looked different and they felt differently about it and each other i recommend this funny moving movie to all br br
<START> i know that in this episode there's other stuff apart from what i am going to discuss and in fact i think it has some virtues for example the fact after we had been given a very negative opinion of <UNK> from seeing <UNK> flashbacks in house of the rising sun we get to see <UNK> side of things and get a new more balanced understanding of his life br br but there is an element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly <UNK> my enjoyment of the whole episode before now in the scene where <UNK> appeared with blood on his hands and shirt it had been hinted that <UNK> father was someone who was getting rich through shady illegal methods i thought maybe he was a mob boss even <UNK> operate in korea just like in almost every other country in the world so it was a reasonable possibility however in this episode we learn that <UNK> father is in fact the boss or a top executive of a korean <UNK> company and that what <UNK> had been doing was physically attacking a government official who was actually going to be murdered on his behalf br br i may be especially <UNK> about this because i happen to work in the <UNK> industry but i would say it is spectacularly offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing goes on in korea that huge serious companies like <UNK> or <UNK> which must be the model for this <UNK> car company as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality operate with these mafia like methods instead of like any normal <UNK> company of the west it is just unbelievable to me that the writers would have the <UNK> to write something like that into the story and that there hasn't been an <UNK> in korea over it it feels like <UNK> buy american propaganda portraying foreign car companies as criminal <UNK> third world outfits
<START> cassidy <UNK> brady puts a gun in her mouth blowing the back of her head out on boyfriend <UNK> jason <UNK> cassidy was the lead singer of a demons and death rock band who couldn't shake the sad feelings of her <UNK> neglect towards her you know i can find other reasonable ways to solve this other than putting a bullet through your head she returns however <UNK> the soul of <UNK> jill small her friend who is to replace her on <UNK> so that the group can finish the album <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> death but cassidy made a deal with the dark one and souls are to be <UNK> she's consumed by this anger towards mainly <UNK> but all the band members or anyone within the music studio get dead when they fall prey to whom they believe is a rather <UNK> <UNK> not cassidy returning for <UNK> br br lousy <UNK> budget horror flick looks cheap has a cheap cast who should make plans in another line of work and boasts cheap kill scenes which aren't effective one bit
<START> i love the movies and own the comics the comics are different then the movie but still i'd give it 10 out of 10 it was awesome if the movies got anymore awesome i would have her babies and i am female read the comics you won't regret it yes in this movie since brian p the artist for her died we don't get nearly as good artistic work i mean seriously don't get me wrong these people did great but different versions for different people different <UNK> for different folks as the saying goes any guy who doesn't go <UNK> over her is insane or does not like women or you know just plan insane if i could count on my fingers how in love and how many times i have read the comics i would run out of fingers for sure but hey there is always <UNK>
<START> teenager eddie spends his life being <UNK> and <UNK> due to his obsession with heavy metal music one day he finds out his hero sammi <UNK> has died supposedly burned by the establishment which wanted to put a stop to his music but eddie has his last record never released and when he plays it he starts receiving messages telling him how to deal with his <UNK> before long sammi has revealed he <UNK> to return to life at the local halloween party to exact revenge on the town which once <UNK> him br br filled with humour and in jokes this is a highly entertaining film sammi himself is an original horror movie villain plays on the <UNK> of rock <UNK> <UNK> of the 80's well worth watching
<START> the problem with the killer elite is that just by seeking this film out and <UNK> time to watch it you are putting more effort into the experience than many of its principals did particularly director sam <UNK> br br the already <UNK> <UNK> was heading into rough weather with this film according to at least one <UNK> this was where he became <UNK> with cocaine add to that his <UNK> drinking and it's no wonder things fell apart br br it's a shame because the concept behind the film is a good one and the first ten minutes promise much mike <UNK> james <UNK> and george <UNK> robert duvall are private <UNK> who do a lot of dirty work for the cia they move quick live well and seem like the best of friends then something happens to <UNK> their <UNK> br br an opening scene shows them blowing up a building why exactly we aren't told par for the course in terms of this film's murky motivation but the <UNK> is these guys hurt people and don't really care <UNK> much like the wild bunch of <UNK> not so long ago an opening title tells us they work for <UNK> then adds with obvious tongue in cheek the thought the cia might employ such an organization for any purpose is of course preposterous that's a pretty clever way of letting the audience know all <UNK> are off br br add to that a <UNK> strong <UNK> <UNK> cast including burt young gig young and <UNK> regular bo hopkins in the <UNK> role of a madman who can't pass up an opportunity to be shot at for 500 a day and you only wish that the <UNK> including the celebrated sterling <UNK> tried to do something more with the story than turn it into a platform for lazy one liners and bad chop <UNK> <UNK> an attempt at <UNK> a dose of liberal social commentary is <UNK> <UNK> in you're so busy doing their dirty work you can't tell who the bad guys are someone tells <UNK> as if either he or we need it pointed out br br worse still are <UNK> clumsy direction and <UNK> pacing we're 40 minutes into the film before we get our first battle scene a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a bunch of people we haven't even met before are seen fighting at san francisco airport their battle <UNK> with a conversation in an office <UNK> br br by the end of the film what's left of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of <UNK> victory ships ninjas running out in the open to be <UNK> down while <UNK> <UNK> off one liners that <UNK> any hint of real suspense lay me seven to five i'll take the little guy he <UNK> just before a climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors from china which we all know is the land of the ninja the battle takes place in san francisco but surprisingly no <UNK> arrive to break things up br br <UNK> is much better in smaller scenes like when <UNK> recovering from some nasty <UNK> is told by one of his bosses played by a smooth arthur hill that he's been <UNK> dumped by the organization <UNK> refuses to stay down and his <UNK> scenes though momentum killing for the movie feature fine acting from him and amy <UNK> <UNK> daughter as a supportive nurse <UNK> was one of the <UNK> best actors and his <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> duvall hopkins and both <UNK> give killer elite real <UNK> br br but you don't watch killer elite thinking about that you watch it thinking of the film that got away
<START> nobody but nobody could chew the scenery like the divine one ruth elizabeth davis and elizabeth and <UNK> is a great example why although she <UNK> the part at times watch her when she <UNK> about <UNK> writing the lyrics to a song her ladies in waiting are about to play in that one moment she makes us understand how elizabeth was able to rule and rule absolutely at other times she is done in by the <UNK> <UNK> when elizabeth has to be vulnerable she comes off as weak and <UNK> this has the added effect of <UNK> her authority when she blows her stack and threatens to <UNK> justice it's hard to take her seriously br br flynn exudes charm making us see how <UNK> was able to worm his way into <UNK> heart but he is totally inept at conveying the complexity and sheer evil of the man it also doesn't help that <UNK> is badly <UNK> why is he this <UNK> who wants to <UNK> his queen even as he <UNK> <UNK> to her except only that he is more blue blooded thus more worthy of rule and why does <UNK> <UNK> elizabeth by <UNK> her and <UNK> letters he's in no risk of falling out of favor and we know where <UNK> and his head is headed so why does he risk his own head by <UNK> up the inevitable br br what did <UNK> do with all the he was given he doesn't even bother to try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sound stage he should've ended it with elizabeth the first time alone at the tower everything else that follows especially the final scene between her and <UNK> is unnecessary the costumes are fantastic and is it me or does bette look exactly like susan sarandon
<START> this film could be one of the most underrated film of bollywood history this 1994 blockbuster had all of it good performances music and direction i remember i was in <UNK> when this movie was running and it was somewhere in march at <UNK> time the people there were playing its song <UNK> <UNK> at their <UNK> in highest volume if someone who likes to watch some like it hot and <UNK> over marilyn monroe he should see this movie thumbs up to govinda how many of you know that this film was shot in south of india and after sholay could be one of the very few <UNK> to hit silver screen with films like these indian comedy could never be dead
<START> this <UNK> for a movie is about absolutely nothing rachel <UNK> must have needed the money the film must have been made on a very low budget because the lighting was non existent i made a <UNK> if i ever see pete <UNK> other i'll commit suicide i'd be happy to know if there was 1 a plot or 2 a script my biggest regret is i wasted my time watching this rubbish
<START> william hurt may not be an american <UNK> idol anymore but he still has pretty good taste in b movie projects here he plays a <UNK> in <UNK> waste clean ups with a tragic past tracking down a <UNK> loser on the run played by former pretty boy <UNK> who has been <UNK> with a deadly poison current pretty boy hardy <UNK> jr possibly more handsome than his dad is featured as <UNK> arrogant boss in a horrifying sequence at a chemical production plant which gets the story moving natasha <UNK> is a slightly wacky government agent looking into the incident who provides inevitable high <UNK> love interest for hero hurt michael brandon pops up to play a slimy take no prisoners type whose <UNK> you can't wait for the <UNK> <UNK> company wins the product placement award for 2000 as the soft drink is featured throughout the production shot lovingly on location in a <UNK> picture <UNK> <UNK>
<START> and here's yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror <UNK> <UNK> the red queen kills seven times is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting stylish production values enchanting music great acting talents and <UNK> gory murder sequences it's a fabulous giallo released in the golden year 1972 that belongs in the top five of every fan of italian cinema the storyline doesn't just introduce your average black <UNK> sexually frustrated killer but <UNK> good old fashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous red queen at young age their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings kitty and evelyn about an uncanny lady who once every 100 years on april <UNK> kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim <UNK> years later kitty has become the successful choreographer of a prominent <UNK> agency even sharing her bed with the general manager when suddenly the killing spree begins sister evelyn would be the obvious <UNK> but she moved to the states recently or has she complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the red queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallo history her face can never be seen but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim she's not exactly gentle either as her victims are <UNK> stabbed with a <UNK> dragged behind cars and even <UNK> on <UNK> that latter one is truly one of the greatest most gruesome acts of violence i've ever seen what more could you possibly request some classy and <UNK> nudity perhaps the gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered among them barbara <UNK> and a young <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> isn't the most famous giallo director as he only made this one and the equally recommended the night evelyn came out of the grave but his influence and importance should not be forgotten
<START> generally it's difficult to rate these cut <UNK> films some of the segments can be quite good while others bring down the rating of the overall product in this one for instance the all girl scene in the doctor's office was quite exciting one of the best in this viewer's limited viewing history then there's <UNK> segment the lady is always entertaining and the story that <UNK> the whole together was an interesting concept the <UNK> scene that <UNK> out the offering ain't bad either technically the production values are fairly high recommended
<START> i love this show br br every time i watch an episode i repeat that line and remind myself how good of a show this is i am a huge sci fi fan and this show has grounds to be the most important science fiction show in the history of film tv there are so many theories in this show about the universe i could start a religion its amazing season after season the show gets better and better br br i've been a fan of <UNK> since i was 5 19 now and i find it so ironic that my 2 favorite tv shows of all time star richard dean anderson its also interesting how each character is practically the opposite of the other br br back when i first saw stargate the movie i instantly liked it and considered it one of my favorite sci fi flicks then hearing a tv show would spin from it i got really excited but didn't get showtime till the fifth season was almost over br br though i'm disappointed to hear that <UNK> <UNK> and dean <UNK> wanted to do a trilogy of movies but the studio <UNK> the series instead br br id say though that it turned out just fine maybe even better br br this show is amazing and i hope it never dies atlantis here we come
<START> this movie is about two guys who made up a sport on the spot trying to get 2 get the hot chick baseketball becomes a <UNK> sport joe cooper <UNK> parker is the beloved captain but is hated when he loses the <UNK> to some other rival team he meets the girl of his dreams <UNK> <UNK> and in the end they kiss the first time i saw this movie i wet my pants it was so funny a definite must see for all comedy fans if you love south park you'll love this maybe don't watch with kids it is bit inappropriate for little <UNK> some <UNK> give it 6 1 2 out of ten i give it 11 out of ten i like coop he rocks i gotta go bye bye thanks for reading this
<START> i gave <UNK> a perfect 10 i gave this 1 br br it's story is very boring and it has only little to do with the original <UNK> lots of things from <UNK> was <UNK> and they put in new stupid stuff instead this story is taking place in <UNK> if i remember correctly but for some reason the <UNK> is now more dangerous confused br br and the action scenes are nothing to be happy about well most of them aren't only the first one is great and there aren't many action scenes at all and they're all pretty short br br at one point in the story the main character travels through time about 5 times within a few minutes no wait make that two times br br in short don't waste time watching this movie it's not worth it
<START> i've seen this movie after watching <UNK> version i've found that one a very good one and i thought this would not be as good but i was wrong british version was far better and enjoyable i found jeremy northam more <UNK> than mark strong but i can say that strong catches much better <UNK> knightley anyway both versions are good but anyone that loved <UNK> books should watch this movie i agree with <UNK> andrew davies changed a few things but still remains faithful to the original br br 10 out of 10 br br my 2 cents
<START> i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen i was bored and looked through the t v and found home room and it was already in about 5 min but i got hooked it was so interesting and moving it shows what can happen in anyone's life i give it a 10 more if possible the director writer and actors did an amazing job i think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it it was great drama mystery and more i cried for hours i think that the director writer should write more movies like this one i loved it i didn't even know about this movie which is sad because it was so good i wish it could go in the movies for more people to see
<START> i'm going to say first off that i have given this film a 3 out of 10 after some thought i was going to give it a straight out 1 but it got a couple extra points for the body count but that would be about it let me explain i paid literally <UNK> for this dvd in a supermarket because i tend to have a lot of faith in bargain horror flicks b movies especially but if this film was aiming for b status as i suspect it was for a number of reasons which i'll touch on in a <UNK> then it failed <UNK> not only did it shoot for b and miss it landed somewhere around f this film had so many opportunities to be good and it pretty much failed on all accounts i say above that it's likely this film was aiming for b status and it seems to try and achieve this by trying to blend humour with horror which can either be very good or very bad for example later freddy films dream warriors <UNK> are all about freddy's style and nose <UNK> which works out great but this film completely bombed in that respect because the times where they tried to <UNK> humour were mostly just stupid i will admit though that towards the beginning of the film the humour was good in fact for about half an hour i liked this film and was prepared to <UNK> myself on another good find but what really killed this film for me was the inappropriate kills for instance when <UNK> <UNK> the cat against the board and writes <UNK> with it's blood using its body as a brush or when <UNK> <UNK> the door into the helpless disabled elderly woman now i'm not usually too against senseless kills in films hey thats the point right but in those two cases i just found it grossly offensive and unnecessary to anything in the film plot especially for me the film went <UNK> from then on one major bad point about this film is that i hated every character in it the kid <UNK> was just ridiculously annoying i'm at a loss to explain how he could possibly write off all those bodies and people being killed in front of his eyes as a trick i mean come on i completely understand that to be in a horror film a character does have to be somewhat stupid like running upstairs when you should blatantly be running out of the house screaming for help but this kid took the <UNK> i wanted to kill him myself by the end of it it was completely unbelievable and if i had to hear him say <UNK> ' one more time i was going to bang my head against a wall because thats what watching this film felt like why didn't i just turn the film off mainly because i honestly believe an ending can sometimes redeem a film but i was wrong in this case the ending did not redeem this film it further irritated the hell out of me and was <UNK> to the plot line i get it already the killer is always going to come back dressed as someone else be welcomed into the house by the stupid kid and go on a killing spree again because no one suspects him in that costume i get it this film made me physically angry because it was so stupid and if by some foul mistake you do end up watching this film watch out for the intestines frankly if that guy actually did have intestines that looked like that i'd be surprised he wasn't already dead let alone until <UNK> rips them out and ties them to a chair br br in fact i'll even go so far as to say that the only character i liked at all in this film was actually the killer purely because when his <UNK> <UNK> worked it did work all in all the plot line of this film dragged anything that might have been good down why was the killer killing i don't know i can live without knowing who he actually was thats fairly typical but without some kind of motive hell i don't know i'd settle for him having a bad halloween as a kid it just seems more than senseless just stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid stupid in fact i hated this film so much that i specifically <UNK> with imdb just so i could comment on it save your money save your sanity stay away from it
<START> this movie is complete crap avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs it is rambling and incoherent i pride myself on <UNK> the depths of 70's sleaze cinema from everything from <UNK> to <UNK> kitty i like being shocked but i need a coherent story however if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you the saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the <UNK> wang i mean its just plain hard to sit through not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly please i know the cover is interesting what looks like a <UNK> hands reaching for a woman's bare ass but don't waste your time or money as you won't get either back
<START> what is happening to <UNK> drama first losing <UNK> quite simply the worst tv drama i have seen in years and now perfect parents a complete <UNK> from start to finish whoever is responsible for <UNK> this drivel should be receiving there <UNK> by special delivery br br in most drama thrillers a <UNK> to suspend certain levels of belief is necessary so that the the plot line can develop but perfect parents took this to a new level i suspended so much belief by the end of this nonsense i felt i had been force fed on a <UNK> load of magic <UNK> it was like the <UNK> had decided to try and create a drama by numbers involving some serious issues religion education greed fear murder <UNK> the only trouble was as the great eric <UNK> once said when playing a piano i'm playing all the right notes just not necessarily in the correct order for your next script guys i suggest you try reading a few more books on script development than script writing for <UNK> br br due to the ridiculous script and the utter lack of tension in the direction the acting was suitably low key not the fault of the actors as the cast was top notch but i suggest that all of the actors involved in this sorry piece of drama should <UNK> their agents the next time the <UNK> attempts to deliver a script from <UNK> drama department make sure the <UNK> is firmly nailed shut
<START> i saw the mst3k version of deathstalker iii and loved the movie so much even <UNK> that i decided to watch the entire series of deathstalker films i bought i and ii and settled down for a laugh br br nothing about deathstalker i was funny on any level and when the credits rolled i was embarrassed and <UNK> that i had bought it too much <UNK> and nudity i guess either <UNK> 3 was a much <UNK> production or mst3k really edited a lot because i expected something similar i e stupid and <UNK> and simple i was wrong even at 6 99 it seemed a waste of money i didn't even open <UNK> 2 as i will return it tomorrow now i'll probably just throw away this dvd as i can't return it and no one wants it including myself so really don't bother with this one even the nudity lots of it btw is uninspiring and <UNK>
<START> do you still love woody allen's humor and sense of the absurd do you wait <UNK> for movies that get the plot going in the first five minutes instead of making you wait around if so you will adore this comedic murder mystery it has all the elements of a good mystery sharp plot a handsome suspect romance and intrigue mixed together with enough laughs and <UNK> at fate to keep even the most jaded of movie goers happy br br with beautiful people and gorgeous homes and landscapes to <UNK> this <UNK> movie is just the thing to take your minds off your troubles as woody might say what's not to like
<START> for anyone who liked the series this movie will be something to watch however it also leaves you wanting more i loved the way that every character detective made an appearance least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for they leave a reason for another movie my guess is <UNK> of course this like the series was a very well put together series of scenes this is a series i wish had lived on thanks to the cast for some wonderful tv
<START> i will admit that i have seen maybe five minutes of jerry springer i don't consider myself a <UNK> but i really think that i am above watching what's on his show you should try to elevate yourself above that too br br i saw this movie as part of a social studies event i was <UNK> i was told that this movie really had little to do with springer himself rather it centered on the lives of those who would appear on springer handled better this movie might have actually been a fascinating look at how pathetic these people's lives actually are i will admit i felt a <UNK> of empathy for connie molly <UNK> this is all she has in life how sad that she feels she must go on <UNK> show in order to resolve this br br i really feel sorry for molly <UNK> appearing in this have you noticed that after this movie she has mainly been <UNK> to b roles on tv i will say this about <UNK> she is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman i have no doubt that she is very earnest in her acting and she tries to play her roles with a lot of empathy the problem is that <UNK> can't carry a scene on her own she just doesn't have what it takes to do a lead role her best work will always be angel on <UNK> head a show that was not great but its heart was in the right place and when she <UNK> on seinfeld as sister <UNK>
<START> bela lugosi gets to play one of his rare good guy roles in a serial based upon the long running radio hit which was also the source of a feature film where lugosi played the villain lugosi cuts a fine dashing figure and its sad that he didn't get more roles where he could be the guy in command in a good way here <UNK> returns from the east in order to help the princess <UNK> who is being hunted by the leaders of the cult of <UNK> who need her to bring back from the dead the high <UNK> of their cult this is a good looking globe <UNK> serial that is a great deal of fun to be certain the pacing is a bit slack more akin to one of principals the producing studios features then a rip roaring adventure but it's still enjoyable this plays better than the two feature films that were cut from it because it allows for things to happen at their own pace instead of feeling rushed or having a sense that hey i missed something one of the trilogy of three good serials lugosi made the others being <UNK> coast guard and phantom creeps
<START> when watching little man you'll spend its running time trying to figure out its many plot holes and thats not a good sign because this film is supposed to be a comedy your supposed to be laughing at it but will you probably not br br the main problem with little man is its concept its far too ridiculous to accept even as a cartoonish comedy so when the loud <UNK> and over the top jokes kick in they make the whole thing seem ten times <UNK> than it already is br br but its a comedy some of you might be screaming thats true but thats no excuse for such a dumb plot i mean come on think about it if you saw a baby with a grown mans face wouldn't you be the least bit suspicious and if <UNK> wanted to hide the diamond so badly why didn't he put it in a nearby shelf instead of a random <UNK> hand bag and how can a <UNK> doctor not <UNK> that <UNK> is a grown man i mean seriously what br br its not about the plot its about the laughs you might be screaming well <UNK> the thing see there are hardly any laughs in little man and that just make the dumb ass plot stand out all the more br br if you really want to watch a wayans brothers comedy with a belief <UNK> plot stick to white chicks because at least that had a few decent laughs what ever you do steer clear of little man
<START> this movie stars emily watson of breaking the waves fame this movie about one man's obsession takes place at a resort where a chess <UNK> is being held a chess master arrives and shortly after falls <UNK> in love at first sight with a woman played by emily watson she falls for this oddball of a man who is obsessed with chess this is all at the <UNK> of her mother who is far more interested in seeing her with another young gentleman a proper gentleman her mother feels that this is just a passing fancy for the young woman as she has a tendency to take in odd animals and such what ensues is mostly a journey through the man's psyche it tells the story of how his past is closely tied with his present emily watson is amazing in this as well as the actor who plays the main character it is definitely slow but is well worth the watching the ending was even satisfying
<START> for all of you that don't speak swedish the swedish original title of this film <UNK> <UNK> into something in the line of the robbers this fact is the main problem i have with the film cause it's not really about the robbers at all it's about a young woman working for the swedish police <UNK> <UNK> a regular desk job one would think but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands as the story goes even shooting one of the robbers exactly we've seen this before the fact that there's a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesn't really help as the ending is just as clich√© as the first two thirds of the film br br what saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that it's masterfully executed in all ways that the actors are as great as they are and don't <UNK> and that the director really manages to keep it as <UNK> exciting as it is for the most of the story br br one thing that i really loved about this film is the fact that it's music sets the right mood when it's needed but is absent for the rest of the time which gives a nice sense of reality to the <UNK> and car chases spread throughout the film a nice touch the fact that michael <UNK> is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get <UNK> sadly hurts the film as you know that he's not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background but that's something you have to neglect br br all in all it's an entertaining film that steals more money in it's plot than time from you 7 10
<START> first of all i must admit batman the animated series is the best batman series by far we watched it when it used to be on tv i didn't realize that there was a season four actually there wasn't <UNK> ends with season 3 and it should have stopped there br br why did they have to mess with a good thing <UNK> and poison <UNK> now have terrible grey faces the joker looks beyond scary it seems that each time they <UNK> his appearance he looks more and more <UNK> he doesn't seem to have <UNK> anymore and now he doesn't even look remotely human although he is br br bruce wayne is voiced by kevin <UNK> who does the best batman although he now looks like superman there is nothing that sets him apart because they both look the same bruce wayne now has blue eyes br br night wing really needs a <UNK> please alfred just has <UNK> from eyes looks more like a character from the 80's br br i have watched three episodes from disc 1 in the series and i already find that this version is more violent and graphic there is blood in every episode br br if you are a fan of batman the animated series there is no batman season 4 they just included this series as season 4 for <UNK> if they just released it as the new batman adventures i don't think as many people would have bought it br br save yourself the disappointment and stick to seasons 1 3
<START> you wouldn't expect a movie like this to be good and it isn't it's a no budget ultra violent zombie movie filmed with a bad looking hand held camera and it's hilarious the actors obviously have never acted before and it shows in their terrible hilarious <UNK> there is no plot to be seen the little plot i could find seemed to be that a government experiment escaped and a group of zombie seems to be <UNK> a couple families the gore effects are actually some of the most sickening i've ever seen it seems the gore effects people <UNK> a butcher shop for all the body parts and many scenes involve zombies <UNK> people and eating their organs it's a funny and sickening film and it's about as bad as you can get in terms of any movie br br my rating bomb 90 mins
<START> a youth gets a bad hair day goes out on a hill and falls into where he can't escape then he meets mr <UNK> a <UNK> dude from 2 000 years ago as his very best friend and an arnold <UNK> look and sound alike his <UNK> strength helps the boy out of danger and later <UNK> to modern life so what's the big deal this is the <UNK> idea for a family outing either way this one shouldn't have been attempted at all really our fictional character of might and <UNK> is nothing more than a typical stranger who appears ordinary to the rest of the universe to add to the <UNK> is the lack of anything new or appealing and before you know it there is some attempted violence that doesn't qualify this as family entertainment the scene where <UNK> complains of his <UNK> is <UNK> though just spend a nice quiet afternoon in the park for a change
<START> by now you've probably heard a bit about the new disney dub of miyazaki's classic film laputa castle in the sky during late summer of 1998 disney released <UNK> delivery service on video which included a preview of the laputa dub saying it was due out in 1999 it's obviously way past that year now but the dub has been finally completed and it's not laputa castle in the sky just castle in the sky for the dub since laputa is not such a nice word in spanish even though they use the word laputa many times throughout the dub you've also probably heard that world renowned composer joe <UNK> who scored the movie originally went back to <UNK> the excellent music with new <UNK> laputa came out before my neighbor <UNK> and after <UNK> of the valley of the wind which began studio <UNK> and it's long string of hits and in my opinion i think it's one of miyazaki's best films with a powerful lesson <UNK> inside this two hour and four minute gem laputa castle in the sky is a film for all ages and i urge everyone to see it br br for those unfamiliar with castle in the <UNK> story it begins right at the start and doesn't stop for the next two hours the storytelling is so flawless and masterfully crafted you see miyazaki's true vision and believe me it's one fantastic one the film begins with <UNK> a girl with one <UNK> past as she is being held captive by the government on an <UNK> <UNK> holds the key to laputa the castle in the sky and a long lost civilization the key to laputa is a sacred <UNK> she has which is sought by many namely the government the military and the air pirate group the <UNK> gang who <UNK> and <UNK> later <UNK> soon the pirates attack the ship and she escapes during the raid she falls a few thousand feet but the fall is soft and thanks to her <UNK> as she <UNK> down from the sky <UNK> an orphan boy who survives by working in the mines sees <UNK> and catches her the two become fast friends but thanks to her <UNK> the two get caught up in one huge thrill ride as the <UNK> gang and government try to capture <UNK> one action sequence after another we learn all of the character's motives and identities as we build to the emotional and action packed climax which will surely please all with it's fantastic animation and wonderful dialogue plus somewhat <UNK> surprise i think this film is simply remarkable and does hold for the two hour and four minute run time the story is wonderful as we peak into <UNK> miyazaki's animation which has no limits the setting of the film is a <UNK> of many time periods it does seem to take place at the end of the <UNK> but it is some <UNK> universe which has advanced technology and weapons laputa is also surprisingly a funny film the film has tons of hilarious moments almost equal to the drama and action the film holds i think the funniest part is a fight scene where <UNK> boss faces off against a pirate and soon after a riot breaks out it's funny as we see the men compare their strength and the music fits right in with it perfectly br br now let's talk about how the dub rates an excellent cast give some great performances to bring these characters to life teen <UNK> james van der <UNK> plays the hero <UNK> who has a much more mature voice then in the japanese version where in the original he sounded more <UNK> either way i think his voice is a nice fit with <UNK> anna <UNK> the young oscar winner from the piano plays <UNK> this is also a nice performance but the voice is a bit uneven she doesn't stay true to one accent at times she sounds as american as apple pie but at other times she sounds like someone from new zealand the performance i most enjoyed however was of <UNK> <UNK> who played mama <UNK> not only is this an excellent performance but the voice and emotion she gives the character really brings it to life if there was ever a live action laputa movie g d <UNK> she would be the one to play her you can just imagine her in the role well somewhat luke skywalker himself mark <UNK> is <UNK> and this is another top rate <UNK> performance you may be familiar with <UNK> from a long line of voice work after he did the original star wars movies but he <UNK> <UNK> to full evil his voice sounds like his regular voice and mix of the joker who he played for many episodes on the animated batman series <UNK> out the cast is voice character actor jim <UNK> who does a great gruff job as the general and andy dick and mandy <UNK> as members of the <UNK> gang br br now let me talk about what really makes this dub special joe <UNK> newly arranged music for those who have never heard of him mr <UNK> does the music and like all of miyazaki's films the music is very memorable each of his scores has it's own <UNK> which fits the particular film perfectly now these new <UNK> he has done are more american like which i think was the goal of the new <UNK> don't worry the classic tunes of the japanese version are still here in great form the score to me sounds to be arranged like this is a hollywood blockbuster it has more power it has more emphasis it's <UNK> and deeper the film's prologue the first seconds where we are introduced to the <UNK> has some new music i am not sure but i believe when we first saw the ships there was no music at all but a majority of the music has new backdrops and more background music to enjoy things seem very enhanced in a powerful scene the music is more stronger then in the original versions in a calm scene it's more <UNK> overall i think many of you will be pleased with the new <UNK> an mixes i highly did myself and personally think it helps improve the film i prefer the new score over the old one and i hope disney will release or license the music rights to a full blown soundtrack br br another plus side to the dub is that the story remains faithful and much of the original japanese lines are intact in <UNK> i'm sure a few lines where changed and this is the same way lines have been changed but a majority are close or exactly the original lines and dialogue miyazaki has written i was afraid some excellent lines would be butchered but they were there intact some new lines have been added as well which help out but i am not sure whether to consider this a good thing or a bad thing disney did not translate the ending song it was in japanese i was <UNK> when they did completely new songs for the <UNK> dub but with this version it's the original song in japanese so i guess it's good it's still the original but bad since a majority of people seeing this dub speak english br br there is a big down side to this dub and it deals with how the voices match the character's lips of course in any dub it won't be perfect but i think in <UNK> and <UNK> the dubbing of lines to match were much better executed and disney had a little bit more time with this one some of the time everything matches perfect some of the time it doesn't <UNK> match and in a rare case someone says something and the lips don't move at all there's a scene where <UNK> chuckles and her mouth doesn't move one bit br br as far as things about the film itself these are my thoughts i thought the most amazing part of laputa was the animation from the opening sequence to the ending the animation is so lush and detailed you just have to watch in awe you see the true nature of each character true detail to their face with extreme close ups and action you have to give a ton of credit for the effort that these animators put into this film everything is so well done and beautifully hand drawn it's like a moving piece of art and to think this was done in the mid 1980's the animation is quite different from disney <UNK> has it's own distinctive <UNK> which is very different but very good and after all these years the colors look as vibrant as ever laputa also has tons of action sequences lots of plane <UNK> plus a few on ground these sequences are so well done and so intriguing it's scary that they are comparable to a big budget action film and the finale is just something you must see the sound effects are pure and classic and fit explosions guns firing and everything else well and like all miyazaki films each one focuses on a different theme i g <UNK> confidence this one has a great a lesson on greed and power people don't realize how greed can take over you and how having too much power isn't good people are obsessed with power and are greedy and the main <UNK> <UNK> greatly shows this br br all in all laputa castle in the sky was a great film to begin with and is now improved for the most part i am glad a more mainstream audience now have the chance to see this classic animated film in all it's glory with a great voice cast who put a lot into the film with the excellent <UNK> musical score from joe <UNK> disney has done a nice job on this dub and is quite worthy though i think the voices matched the mouths better in the <UNK> and princess <UNK> disney <UNK> castle in the sky is still a great dub and is worth the long <UNK> because now more can <UNK> a fantastic film
<START> i just viewed this movie last night and i don't think i will ever think the same about any of the actors involved because this movie will stick in the back of my mind br br the above statement can be thought of as a good or a bad thing i mean every time i see tom cruise or <UNK> moore in a movie i think of a few good men which is a good thing now every time i see ron <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> i will think of <UNK> which is a very bad thing br br i picked this up thinking that it might be something intelligent or at least make me chuckle and with <UNK> gross and the aforementioned <UNK> and <UNK> i thought that it at least wouldn't be bad you could tell the movie was made on a budget the size of <UNK> indiana where exactly but maybe they used every dollar to make a good movie wrong br br this movie is not funny or entertaining in any sense of either word it is just there and lasts for <UNK> excruciating slow minutes br br the characters are paper thin you almost care about none of the characters and since the leads are two struggling hollywood writers with a dream that is all the two struggling writers with a dream who wrote this need you to know about them okay the two real writers know all about there <UNK> versions of themselves so they figure so does the audience they don't even think about character development except for trying to tie there story back to <UNK> island br br the plot is unoriginal two guys live in a <UNK> center where one of them stores a bed and there are about twenty other people living there too the rest of the story is contrived and stupid have you seen national <UNK> favorite deadly sins the second story with joe <UNK> is about a television writer who can't find a good story to make a tv movie about so he creates one now substitute the television writer for a screenwriter <UNK> <UNK> into to annoying actors half his age and take away the comedy and you have this movie br br the actors try <UNK> <UNK> is in the movie for maybe 10 minutes and still gives the best performance in the movie she is still hot but it would help if she would actually star in a movie instead of constantly making cameos as for everyone else i don't think it was the actors fault because they have bad material br br go watch the national <UNK> movie but stay away from this movie
<START> what an absolutely stunning movie if you have 2 5 <UNK> to kill watch it you won't regret it it's too much fun <UNK> carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn't anything more other than him i still liked it the music by a r <UNK> takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it
<START> i just saw this movie premiere on mtv i must say this was extremely mediocre at its best the dialogue doesn't explain the story very well and i was left feeling like there were a lot of plot holes there isn't one likable character in this adaptation due to poor acting i just find that all of the characters are way too <UNK> when it comes to someone they love also <UNK> and <UNK> love seems very incestuous they seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers i don't understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof br br i watched this movie because of a few actors that i respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films but like i said it's extremely hard to like any of the characters <UNK> <UNK> performance was horrid which was a complete shocker she was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of edward and there just wasn't enough lines for <UNK> <UNK> for me even to critique her performance johnny <UNK> did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit <UNK> he was the only person i <UNK> with as for erika christensen and mike <UNK> they were supposed to be our <UNK> but came off as whiny and <UNK> br br i just didn't enjoy this movie very much or the music in it there was a brief appearance of the christian punk band <UNK> but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again mtv did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not i just <UNK> something so completely different
<START> this film is really bad no i mean really really bad tony scott is a terrible director out of all the films he has made i only like enemy of the state besides that he is one of the worse directors of all time what appalled me the most is richard kelly director of <UNK> <UNK> did the screenplay to this now richard kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes hope he has <UNK> his lesson br br now i love mickey <UNK> new roles but i cant even like him in this because of the terrible story and look of it don't get me wrong i still love mickey rourke but he has made a few <UNK> in his time and this is one of them i don't know what to say about <UNK> <UNK> i think she's a little too overrated i just cant feel for her in films br br all in all this film is bad thats it 1 10 j d <UNK>
<START> wow it's ironic since this movie has been out for awhile i think that someone else just reviewed it a couple days ago br br anyways i watched this movie simply because it has nick <UNK> for the record br br the movie was ridiculous the characters drove me insane they were so clich√© and stereotyped this movie had some of the worst dialogue i have ever heard it had way too many plot twists too br br there is one scene in the movie worth seeing however the scene warm heart cold gun where nick <UNK> kills the obnoxious girl in the shower well actually they were all obnoxious but his acting in that scene was excellent the look on his face it reminded my of american psycho a good movie the scene is worth seeing but not worth seeing the rest of the movie for do yourself a favor and don't watch it
<START> a less than subtle poke at the beliefs and <UNK> of the catholic church is given a darker <UNK> of death near the end of the show throughout the show dark humour plays a medium through which several <UNK> heard <UNK> questions are asked especially if god is so good why does he allow evil to exist in the world br br diane keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version though some might disagree of they stereotyped religious teacher who <UNK> the company line and <UNK> half the world to burn in hell to celebrate her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she invites her first students to return and perform their christmas <UNK> br br however when the <UNK> update their play to parody sister <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the nun is pushed over the edge sending the story <UNK> into a chain of unhappy events the ending finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts br br not recommended go watch the play instead
<START> another big star cast another <UNK> set another <UNK> director another flick filled with songs that's <UNK> the <UNK> buster but alas what's missing at the day end is a story that every <UNK> expects of from such a big budget motion picture so much hype is what that was lurking around the movie before <UNK> red carpet premiere a hype which went to an extent where anil kapoor <UNK> that the movie would be one of the finest love stories ever made after <UNK> <UNK> le <UNK> well <UNK> which movie were you speaking of well the plot of the movie is about 6 different couples and 12 different people who have a total different stance towards life but despite their different approach towards life they all have one common problem that's love well indeed a <UNK> theme but little did we expect that the movie would be such boredom that it will let down the last expectation the audience would have from such a <UNK> movie these are kinda movies which i totally <UNK> because after spending a <UNK> buck for a <UNK> ticket i get locked in the theatre for 4 hours just waiting in agony for the climax br br the trouble begins right from the start the director gets so confused with the plot that somewhere even he gets <UNK> as to how to share the time <UNK> to six different star casts some of the couples like anil kapoor <UNK> and <UNK> khan whoever the female is opposite to him just doesn't make any sense for their existence in the movie salman who calls himself <UNK> in a weird manner for the entire movie well something like <UNK> again as usual tries to be extra cool with his <UNK> kinda hindi accent hey <UNK> <UNK> now that <UNK> is getting married at least go get some tip from <UNK> to improve your acting abilities a simple <UNK> wouldn't make the movie a box office hit every time and <UNK> stop <UNK> your trade mark beard or you look totally like a <UNK> and <UNK> a girl of your <UNK> age just looks as <UNK> as watching jack nicholson in a romantic movie and please <UNK> avoid putting such superfluous scenes in a movie that is totally not needed for the shot br br the other bigger flaw in the movie was that there wasn't any perfect <UNK> between the stories of different couples every story itself looks as if it is taken from different flicks put together to form a sadistic plot of <UNK> e <UNK> bollywood still has to learn a lot from movies like snatch <UNK> where the director knows the perfect art of <UNK> the different unrelated sequences to form a perfect <UNK> storyline br br somewhere while i was <UNK> the pre release movie reviews someone predicted that the movie wouldn't do good because the title of this movie adds up to the number 28 and 28 is considered a bad number in <UNK> but i totally take my stand by saying the movie will fail not <UNK> of its <UNK> <UNK> but because of the <UNK> of flaw that <UNK> in the movie and when director like <UNK> <UNK> can make such major <UNK> in the entire storyline of the movie any wonder wouldn't have saved the movie from bombing at the box office br br my suggestion for all you guys is please avoid watching this movie at any cost it isn't worth a pie that you pay for the ticket there indeed are better movies on theater screens currently which are worth watching more than <UNK> e <UNK>
<START> yes <UNK> this is the nick name that donna <UNK> romantic lead played by tom drake <UNK> her with so lets get this clear right away from her first <UNK> role in the get away 1941 too her last dallas 1984 1985 ms reed could never be described as <UNK> not this attractive and slim actress whose roles at m g m seldom lived up to her talents br br ms reed is supported by a cast of competent character actors who unfortunately must <UNK> through this alleged <UNK> <UNK> comedy clearly m g m was out of their depth making this type of film a type better produced over at columbia paramount rko and even universal neither the <UNK> of <UNK> lubitsch nor the wit of preston <UNK> could save this film a rather conventional romantic comedy that had all the <UNK> of a pre war wwii effort br br if irving <UNK> had still been alive the screen play would have either gone through a significant rewrite or never seen the light of day it did fit into louis b <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of none challenging family entertainment a form that could not stand up to the post war challenges of the <UNK> <UNK> loss of their theater chains television and would contribute to m g m s decline <UNK> for donna reed her best days are ahead of her culminating in from here to eternity 1953 and her oscar win as best supporting actress
<START> more directors like <UNK> <UNK> need a greater <UNK> for their talents 7 35 de la <UNK> is absolute genius what <UNK> is able to convey in 8 minutes takes some hollywood directors hours of film to achieve i watched this smiling but feeling a little dirty and not in the sexual way you sit and wonder how you should feel after watching this 8 min <UNK> i was entertained but was disturbed at the same time not many people can do that in just 8 minutes it starts off simple enough a young women comes in for breakfast at her usual place she sits down and someone starts singing from there the film takes you through so many different emotions all at once it is hard to describe it is in black white but this helps with the feeling the film gives you this film makes you want to know more about the characters how they <UNK> previously and how the ending <UNK> their lives afterward i guess it like the old saying leave them wanting more <UNK> <UNK> is able to do that watch this when you can show it to your friends and wonder how 8 minutes can be so much fun without taking off your clothes
<START> i gave this movie a 2 and though i consider myself a science fiction fan i found this movie very difficult to take seriously it was on <UNK> one late night and i'm glad i saw it for free this movie is probably good for a few laughs but not much more br br the special effects are about average for the time period not awful but not great either of course we know more about mars now than we did back then but we really can't hold that against this film the main reason i did not like this movie is because of the story br br there were several parts of this movie that i wish would have been explored in a little more detail the <UNK> injury condition the city on mars the creature in the lake etc overall the movie is much like a lengthy episode of the 1960s version of the outer limits complete with a cheesy ending
<START> please note i see from the various <UNK> that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film i saw the sound version and it was <UNK> <UNK> considering some indicate that the original version was longer and without crappy dubbing my review must be read with this in mind br br although i know that <UNK> <UNK> has a lovely reputation as a film maker and louise brooks has a bit of a cult following as well this is in many ways a technically poorly made film while hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around <UNK> up through the early to almost the mid 30s a lot of famous french films were essentially silent films with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film the lip movements in many and in particular this film don't even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an american like ms brooks could do a french film this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent film and as a silent film this is would have been an average film with excellent camera work at times and some decent silent style acting br br the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot for a silent morality play circa <UNK> it would have been fine but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit <UNK> that means old not <UNK> a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fianc√© can't handle it she gives it all up <UNK> but is <UNK> back to the fancy life and this spells her end a tad melodramatic huh and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped br br finally the character of the <UNK> friend i found very disturbing and unreal he looked like harold lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else as he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean spirited were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused this seems to me that's what is implied and i don't like it at all br br there are far better french films of the era le million la femme du <UNK> <UNK> regain and others as well as better silent films i just can't understand this film's high rating
<START> i saw soylent green back in 1973 when it was first released and maybe another eight times over the years on t v or video it was always one of my favorite sci fi and or charlton heston films br br recently the egyptian theater in l a had a twelve film charlton heston <UNK> i flew in from out of state to see six of the films over a two day period soylent green looked great on the large egyptian screen with a perfect new print from its opening montage to the going home scene to the great ending the film was fantastic br br charlton heston as a cop who lives in a dog eat dog world with few natural resources left and no understanding as to how the world used to be and eddie robinson as a man who remembers the past are both great br br their chemistry together is wonderful the film also looks so much better in a great <UNK> print <UNK> really knows how to fill the screen and the <UNK> writing music used and everything about it works the film is also very powerful in its bleak and very possible view of the future just think how the world population grew the rain forest that disappeared resources used up green house effect getting worse since 1973 i just wonder why this film has not played in theaters all these years its reputation should be better br br speaking of <UNK> often people speak as if charlton heston is not a great actor seeing him in el <UNK> soylent green the <UNK> the <UNK> man will penny and major <UNK> back to back i am convinced he is one of our best actors of course he made about a dozen other great films and for those that care you know what they are br br
<START> zero day is a film few people have gotten to see and what a shame that is br br when i saw the end where the two main characters <UNK> upon the room and mercilessly kill people then commit suicide and it made me grab my stomach i was shaking that's how strong this movie is br br the movie is amazing it's too incredible not to get a perfect ten it's sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film it is not a budget which makes a film good it is the amount of feeling the makers put into it which makes it good br br it leaves a permanent impression in your mind that you simply cannot get out it makes you realise the true horror of shootings especially if you were to know that person and this movie makes you feel like you know these people br br i recommend zero hour to those who feel they are mature enough to watch it i am <UNK> and i feel that this film is just too amazing to be put into words it feels like you're watching something that actually happened
<START> this has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment it takes the <UNK> sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent <UNK> brat brothers over protective fathers and bimbo sisters i'm almost surprised it's disney br br to its credit <UNK> simple <UNK> knows it's a comedy and doesn't try to be more too many shows <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hard hitting this is a trap <UNK> simple <UNK> has avoided it does tackle some issues such as being the school <UNK> but it has fun while doing so in fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it <UNK> handled the tragic death of john ritter and his character br br and i think although john ritter will be sadly missed since he was the reason the show made its mark <UNK> simple <UNK> can still do well if it remembers its humour and doesn't make <UNK> father a second version of paul <UNK>
<START> having seen both fear of a black hat and this is spinal tap i can honestly state that while similar both movies are truly must see there will be many times in fear that will have you in <UNK> it is no wonder why both movies have such a huge cult following fear will soon be available on dvd rent it if you must but the only way to fully enjoy this movie is to have it for yourself
<START> it's very sad that <UNK> <UNK> does not stop making movies they get worse every time <UNK> and <UNK> 2003 is a depressing stab at the camera it's unfortunate that from the many movies that are made <UNK> in romania the worst of them get to be sent abroad e g chicago international film festival this movie without a plot acting or script is a waste of time and money score 0 <UNK> out of 10
<START> i've never been a fan of farrah fawcett until now she was truly amazing in this movie the emotion she must have gone through shooting re take after re take doesn't bare thinking about this was a very hard movie to watch the subject matter is decidedly unpleasant and you feel so helpless just sitting and watching a woman being abused for what seems like an eternity i actually felt that the whole thing <UNK> somewhat when her friends returned to the house and i didn't find the conclusion at all plausible the director seemed very keen in using height in his shots and loved using mirror <UNK> i believe he should have paid more attention to the pace in the second half of this piece i'm sure this makes a heck of a powerful piece of theatre this movie for me although it had merit just fell short
<START> this move was on tv last night i guess as a time filler because it sucked bad the movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way not bad tits and ass though but the story is too ridiculous for words the wolf if that is what you can call it is hardly shown fully save his teeth when it is fully in view you can clearly see they had some <UNK> working on the cgi because the wolf runs like he's running in a <UNK> and the cgi fur looks like it's been <UNK> all shiny br br the movie is full of gore and blood and you can easily spot who is going to get killed <UNK> eaten next even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed they didn't do a good job at it br br don't even get me started on the actors very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds but then again if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks then hey where do i sign up br br overall boring and laughable horror
<START> i think this one sucked on ice because it left the cube and gave us to much information as to the who's and <UNK> the original cube never left the cube and it left everything to your imagination this crap fest however gives you it all and i didn't like it though the acting is solid i think the reason this one was a <UNK> was because it was done by people other than the original filmmakers if they had vincenzo natali do this prequel or even the sequel i think it would have done better and would have been more true to the source so i recommend you stay far far away from this one and <UNK> another movie i don't even want to discuss i gave it a 2 for the acting only
<START> short but long enough cat soup is a very wild trip to watch one day i was just searching though my on demand list through the anime section and came across it and decided to watch it i spent the whole time basically sitting with my jaw <UNK> the whole time i was either <UNK> of thought or had a fleeting one which screamed turn it off but i didn't and actually i'm glad i did br br the animation is stunning very artistic odd and dark i personally loved it for the amazing animation but the seemingly <UNK> story behind it is equally compelling for myself br br a young boy well cat goes in search of his sister's soul in the first part she's lying sick in bed and is soon paid by a visit from a sort of grim <UNK> her soul is split in half one is <UNK> by the cat boy while the other half is lost br br then the rest of the film is slightly lost to me honestly i expect they go back and their world is perhaps slowly falling apart maybe her absence of soul is the answer behind this for the rest of the film contains various stages of which the world's in first there's a giant <UNK> and next it <UNK> up into a bleak desert and then everything <UNK> thanks to either what is god or fate as you will see then i believe they find the sister's soul in the form of an orange flower after that the whole world disappears haha totally didn't get that but it sends <UNK> down my spine each time br br despite it's seemingly random scenes i'm sure there's a deeper message behind it if you watch it enough and do some research personally i love <UNK> stuff like this and would love to spend time doing that just to understand it but to some people it's probably not their cup of tea it comes off as highly disturbing so if you like your straight forward anime this is not a film for you if you have an open mind however i highly recommend this movie
<START> how did such a terrible script manage to attract this cast ridiculous predictable and thoroughly unbelievable this is well acted and <UNK> directed but the material is so bad it still qualifies as one of the all time worst thrillers i've seen in years amazingly bad and not in a fun way avoid at all costs even if you're a fan of someone in the cast
<START> now this is more like it the first movie had some <UNK> dialogue and some weaker acting but it seems like the team behind this got their stuff together for the sequel and put out a solid thoroughly enjoyable hilarious and creative comedy that will keep everyone on the edge of their seats the whole way through br br seriously this is just full of great stuff <UNK> with creativity and it's less of a spoof on 80s movies at the same time the scenes in hell are great and so are the ones in heaven there's really no <UNK> to the mad cap adventurous romp that this one promises and you will never see another movie like this even the hammy final act of the movie isn't as bad as the first one being generally heartwarming and enjoyable in its extremely clich√© <UNK> of family fun movie bliss and even keanu reeves despite looking about 30 isn't that bad here br br sounds like a good deal to me
<START> if the creators of this film had made any attempt at introducing reality to the plot it would have been just one more waste of time money and creative effort fortunately by throwing all <UNK> of reality to the winds they have created a comedic marvel who could pass up a film in which an alien pilot spends the entire film acting like jack nicholson complete with the <UNK> t shirt do not dismiss this film as trash
<START> i love new york is another entry by <UNK> 1 mtv networks showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill obnoxious woman it must have been an easy decision to take the most <UNK> <UNK> speaking <UNK> contestant and her mother and give them a show on this network many will argue this is a show true it's not as bad as it's previous show flavor of love but it's just as bad br br it reminds me of a skit from the 90's show in living color where <UNK> <UNK> wayans was imitating the boxer mike <UNK> on the love connection dating show and he picked robin <UNK> for a date mike talked of how the date was okay but how the obnoxious mother kept <UNK> in this show reminds me of that br br the men are chosen and given names to <UNK> themselves and the woman that they are dating more i would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would not allow her and her mother to give you a name that is so ghetto you'll embarrass yourself every time you appear on tv but these are professional reality actors so why bother br br it escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this the fact that this is as fake as her newly <UNK> <UNK> 15 minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network well you can't hate them for trying to make a buck maybe the wonder is who would want to be with this woman past an hour or wonder if she and her mother's next show would be on the <UNK> any way you slice it it's a train wreck you've seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to <UNK> br br no twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck or any different from any of the others appeals to the lowest common <UNK> and for those calling an end to reality shows this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end immediately
<START> i've rented and watched this movie for the 1st time on dvd without reading any reviews about it so after 15 minutes of watching i've noticed that something is wrong with this movie it's terrible i mean in the trailers it looked scary and serious br br i think that eli roth mr director thought that if all the characters in this film were stupid the movie would be funny so stupid it's funny wrong he should watch and learn from better horror comedies such as fright night the lost boys and the return of the living dead those are funny br br cabin fever is the reason why i <UNK> to www imdb com so i can release my thoughts of <UNK> about it br br i've decided to watch the movie a second time <UNK> and make notes for my partial review to show how foolish the movie is resident evil horror or dude where's my car comedy i can watch over and over again and still enjoy but this br br how bad can a script and a director be this bad here are the awful scenes in <UNK> order br br in the early scenes we see henry who doesn't realize his dog lying on the ground with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and dead <UNK> stare is dead br br the movie doesn't explain anything about the blonde long haired kid who like to bite people br br and my answer to <UNK> unanswered question what's wrong with the woods is nothing the script has that <UNK> guy warn them about the woods just for suspense br br then the <UNK> of the 5 pack bert almost gives us an example of how to start a forest fire he meets now infected henry who begs for help and from here on the movie wants to break the record in using the f word bert starts to freak out because henry looks awfully ill bert don't make me shoot you he forgets to add with my <UNK> gun br br bert heads back to the cabin but how about that he meets <UNK> and jeff who were having sex but now suddenly decide to go out for a walk <UNK> wisely takes out the <UNK> <UNK> bert had started earlier a moment of clarity for a change bert doesn't mention a word about henry because the fool thinks he has killed him with his <UNK> gun br br later as the five <UNK> sit around their <UNK> another weirdo shows up with his dog maybe that's what the warning about the woods is all about it's filled with <UNK> and their dogs they let him sit with them only because he has a huge bag filled with <UNK> their brains are completely <UNK> no wonder why they are all so dumb this is the last time we'll see this forgettable character alive br br henry shows up at their cabin note he was lying all the time a few <UNK> from their cabin looking worse almost like a zombie covered in goo he says he needs a doctor but the young <UNK> refuse to help the poor sucker he gets into their <UNK> truck which of course also has its key in the <UNK> henry almost seems smart enough to drive the hell away from there but instead starts <UNK> blood all over the <UNK> seats and windows the fantastic five come out running armed with a <UNK> gun a knife a baseball bat huh ever tried playing baseball in the middle of the woods a poker and a <UNK> <UNK> can ready to combat the single <UNK> and terribly sick man clever script bert manages to kill the car with one single shot of his <UNK> gun which is only possible in the mind of director eli roth what else am i supposed to do bert yells in his defense jeff and paul try to knock henry down with their bat and poker but miss and crash the <UNK> windows instead henry walks up to the dumb girls who say he's coming towards us thanks for the info dumb <UNK> i can see that but i don't think he wants to do you any harm <UNK> <UNK> in his eyes making henry <UNK> and our hero paul touches <UNK> arm with a burning <UNK> from the <UNK> which they <UNK> left burning while they were inside the cabin where has all that wisdom gone i guess the <UNK> had started to take its <UNK> henry turns into the human torch and runs away screaming br br the following day bert and jeff head out for a mechanic and <UNK> decides to go for help all by herself in the woods as paul stays behind with karen doesn't that sound idiotic <UNK> could have stayed with karen and paul because jeff and bert were already going for help br br i skip my comments now to how we suddenly see <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> over a huge and <UNK> river how did she get a <UNK> does she even know where she's going anyway she goes to the <UNK> and finds a very big and seemingly abandoned cabin and like in most horror movies walks inside the cabin saying hello is anyone there bert suddenly pops up from behind a furniture and scares her and me at first and along comes jeff as well how did they get here did they swim across the river do you see how brainless the script is br br deputy winston meets paul at the cabin he somehow doesn't notice the blood on their truck this happens around 35 minutes of viewing and i have decided to stop torturing myself anymore and popped the dvd out before i take my own eyes out now that's funny br br if you liked this movie do yourself a favor and watch fright night the lost boys or the return of the living dead then you'll see they are more entertaining than this thing even the toxic <UNK> part 2 which is also a lousy film is way more funnier than cabin fever
<START> interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event even though he did save many other captive children the film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and even class rooms in other words the high school is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal dolph lundgren sam <UNK> plays the soldier school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field however the principal asks him to have a <UNK> class as his last duty as a teacher it is at this point in the film when all hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete bomb try to enjoy it if you decided to view it
<START> when deathtrap was first released the poster <UNK> on the cover of this dvd offered a graphic akin to a <UNK> cube it is an appropriate image originally written for the stage by ira <UNK> who <UNK> such memorable works as rosemary's baby and the <UNK> wives the play was one of <UNK> most famous <UNK> and under sidney <UNK> direction it <UNK> to the screen extremely well br br deathtrap is one of those films that it is very difficult to discuss for to do so in any detail gives away the very plot for which it is famous but the opening premise is extremely clever sidney <UNK> michael caine is the famous author of mystery plays but these days he seems to have lost his touch after a particularly brutal opening night an old student named <UNK> anderson christopher reeve sends him a script for a play he has written it is called deathtrap and sidney <UNK> it as a <UNK> hit just the sort of hit that would revive his career indeed a hit to die for and when <UNK> visits to discuss the play events suddenly begin to twist in the most unexpected manner possible br br like anthony <UNK> equally <UNK> sleuth deathtrap is really a story more at home on the stage than the screen to reach full power it needs the <UNK> that a live performance offers still under the expert <UNK> of director sidney lumet it makes a more than respectable showing on the screen much of this is due to the cast which is remarkably fine michael caine gives a truly brilliant performance <UNK> cannon is funny and endearing as <UNK> relentlessly anxious wife and christopher reeve gives what might be the single finest performance in his <UNK> short acting career if you can't see it in a first rate theatrical production this will more than do until one comes along br br gary f taylor aka <UNK> amazon reviewer
<START> if you go to this movie expecting something it isn't you will be disappointed as with any movie this movie contains what <UNK> described as the iceberg effect on the surface its simply a <UNK> of random movie clips <UNK> together to make a movie if this would be written in a book it would be a short story because the action in the movie is very fast paced and unless you actually try to catch it the reasoning behind the plot along with some subtle <UNK> can very well pass you by definitely a movie you will have to see twice in order to fully appreciate experimental cinematography barely describes this movie the camera work and post production add much to the overall <UNK> of the film making it quite artistic at some points and open to interpretation at others something to be desired in american movies as of late although at some parts it may get a little raunchy gruesome and too heavy for some audiences the movie never becomes completely unrealistic the only aspect of the movie that i would write off as needs improvement is the soundtrack selection no movie is ever good without a fitting soundtrack and although the soundtrack is quite fitting the opening is a little too long and the other rap songs in the film really could have been replaced with something more appropriate heavy <UNK> rock or psychedelic <UNK> would have made this film a real trip the <UNK> of imagery and dynamic color <UNK> adds another artistic aspect to it also combined with the events that happen throughout the film this is not a movie you can miss any part of and still understand however that also makes it much more of a <UNK> film to watch and not one you'll quickly get bored of 8 5 10
<START> it does touch a few interesting points but it fails to show evidence of all the <UNK> studies shown who are the <UNK> and <UNK> groups of <UNK> that gathered this data what's up with all the al gore biography going on there like how he liked playing with the <UNK> on the ranch or that his kid got hit by a car too bad but what does that have to do with the <UNK> <UNK> br br i've seen much better stuff in much less time on discovery channel i really don't understand why this has such a high score on imdb unless you've been living under a rock this <UNK> shouldn't be any news to you all this is old news and all al gore is trying to do is get some popularity points p s i'm not american so don't even try saying that i'm a bush fan p
<START> a sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their <UNK> the ex cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting even though they are marrying other people maybe a little trite in that the partners are both type a personalities while our protagonists are much more relaxed not anything heavy but it made me smile and hey for the guys sell the natasha <UNK> angle and the <UNK> sell them the sappy romance everyone wins
<START> the word <UNK> is thrown around too loosely nowadays but this movie well deserves the <UNK> the combination of neil simon walter matthau possibly the world's best living comic actor and the late <UNK> george burns make for a comic masterpiece it is interesting to contemplate what the movie would have been like had not death prevented jack benny from playing george <UNK> part as had been planned as it is the reunion scene in <UNK> apartment is not likely to be <UNK> as a <UNK> definitely one of my desert island films br br enter
<START> this movie was in a sci fi 50 pack a friend of mine got me for christmas it is very similar to the first <UNK> movie and like that movie has scenes with american actors inserted for no real reason one interesting thing about the inserted scenes is that there's a cold war tension portrayed between america and russia like in godzilla gamera is <UNK> by an atomic explosion and <UNK> across the world paying close attention to tokyo because no big monster movie is complete unless tokyo bites it all in all this is an okay movie some of the scenes involving gamera particularly the scenes in <UNK> are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time if you like japanese giant monster movies you'll really get a kick out of this one i give it a 4 out of 10 had this been the <UNK> japanese version that i watched it probably would've gotten a 5
<START> probably minor spoilers br br i cant say i liked it but i cant say i didn't its very strange it has bad things in it like for example a shark that came out of nowhere with the worst cgi you can imagine if i was the director i would cut that part for sure gave me the urge to stop seeing the rest of the movie for some people it will be boring cause it lacks action feels home made sometimes take for example a scene that one of the friends died and next thing they are doing is what <UNK> not crying their telling horror stories to each other <UNK> just after crying for hes lost br br another stupid thing was when they were talking inside the boat they had like hundreds of <UNK> in the table in front of them the boat is surrounded by some kind of <UNK> <UNK> old <UNK> covering the windows and <UNK> <UNK> i thought it was dumb using <UNK> but not thinking about the surroundings besides being in high sea alone br br the good some scary scenes they are nicely done i liked some sometimes horror works better when its hidden when its behind something instead of showing of so this movie does it good maybe because its a low budget i don't know but it works fine for me you will feel tension if you forget some holes like the ones i mentioned above br br do not expect much of it but if you like <UNK> of movie watch this one be patient try to enjoy lol br br sorry about my raw english br br cheers
<START> this film has got to be <UNK> as one of the most disturbing and <UNK> films in years it is one of the few films perhaps the only one that actually gave me <UNK> not even <UNK> <UNK> to which this film bears comparison affected me like that i saw echoes in the film from filmmakers like <UNK> fassbinder and others i had to ask myself what was it about the film that made me feel like i did i think the answer would be that i was watching a horror film but one that defies or even <UNK> the conventions of said genre typically in a horror film horrible and frightening things will happen but on the <UNK> of <UNK> society abandoned houses deserted <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc this handling of the subject in horror is i think a sort of <UNK> <UNK> a principle of darkness and <UNK> <UNK> as a sort of <UNK> space for the desires and fears of the viewer so from this perspective <UNK> is not a horror film it takes place in a perfectly normal society and so <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> of the horror film but what you see is the <UNK> of certain key <UNK> from the horror genre especially concerning the body and its <UNK> the stages of fright and torture it can be put through what <UNK> does is to use the settings of an everyday middle class society as a stage on which is <UNK> a <UNK> play of sexual <UNK> loneliness lack and <UNK> of <UNK> and integrity precisely the themes you would find in horror but subjected to a principle of light and <UNK> from which there is no escape it is precisely within this <UNK> that the power of <UNK> film <UNK> <UNK> deals with these matters as a function of the everyday displays them in <UNK> <UNK> rather than as sites of <UNK> and <UNK> a move you would encounter in said horror genre one important point of reference here is rainer <UNK> fassbinder fassbinder also had a way of <UNK> the political with the personal in his films a tactics of the melodrama that allowed him to deal in a serious and even moral way with political issues like racism <UNK> desire questions concerning <UNK> sexual property and control <UNK> and capitalism etc <UNK> <UNK> of making the <UNK> of everyday society the subject of his film puts him in close <UNK> with fassbinder like this german ally he has a sort of political vision of society that he feels it is his responsibility to put forward in his films during a <UNK> at the <UNK> film festival this year at which <UNK> was a guest he was asked why he would have so many instances of <UNK> <UNK> women in <UNK> but no instances of a woman fighting back <UNK> herself <UNK> <UNK> that some may view it as <UNK> to show violence against women but that he himself felt it would be <UNK> not to show it an artistic statement as good as any i think thank you
<START> i have never known of a film to <UNK> such debate in my life believe me when i say that this film will eventually be remembered as an all time classic i was waiting in anticipation for this film as i had previously loved both lock stock and snatch but after some of the negative reviews i thought i would be very disappointed i absolutely loved this film and i can't wait to see it again this film is totally different to both of the aforementioned ritchie films and also a lot better i have my pick of favourite directors but none of them have pulled off a move as great as guy ritchie has just done with this movie i believe he has taken movie making to another level i know most people will be laughing at this comment <UNK> the reaction to this film but i believe time will prove me right this movie is very confusing and carried on for much longer than the <UNK> or so running time as i couldn't stop thinking about it or trying to piece things together i have now got a pretty good take on everything that happens in this film some answers from endless hours of thinking some answers from reading other people's take on the film and now cannot wait until sunday when i will see it again i just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and they will hopefully be rewarded as i and many others have been
<START> there aren't many <UNK> the odds stories quite like that of christy brown born with cerebral <UNK> in 1930s <UNK> his parents thought his <UNK> was mental as well as physical though eventually properly <UNK> brown in a lower working class family with nearly 20 children had to push himself just to be appreciated by his family through the use of his only fully <UNK> <UNK> his left leg he taught himself to write and paint both skills he developed expertly br br but what makes the film version of <UNK> autobiography my left foot such a great retelling is its <UNK> both director writer jim sheridan and star daniel day lewis have managed to tell this story in a way that doesn't scream for attention and resort to melodrama cheesy struggles and scenes of frustration as well as glorious moments of minute victory are easy <UNK> of a story so <UNK> yet my left foot stays real and <UNK> inspired br br day lewis is the <UNK> to highlight playing anyone with such serious physical <UNK> has to be a demanding task not only does day lewis give us a very complete picture of christy but he also manages to <UNK> the growth improvement and inner change of the character in different stages of his life he plays christy at 17 when he had limited language <UNK> and was emotionally <UNK> just as <UNK> as he does the intellectually learned christy who struggles to cope with why he can't find non <UNK> love the latter theme is the film's strongest and it would've been nice for sheridan and co <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to really flesh that out regardless day lewis gets us to understand and sympathize with all those elements giving a performance that's so believable you often don't have time to think wow he's such a great actor those are the most commendable performances br br equally important but through more subtle means is <UNK> work on the film this story is about day to day life and struggles although christy has such a unique set of circumstances <UNK> his life his struggles are not unlike our own and sheridan <UNK> that concept completely christy struggles with love <UNK> attention questions of self worth and <UNK> his struggles are just more physically <UNK> literally and <UNK> than <UNK> br br sheridan gives us moments that capture the spirit of the large brown family and <UNK> unique place in it the drama <UNK> naturally when tensions are highest and the humor comes in much the same way the dinner scene when christy learns that his doctor teacher the woman he loves is going to marry his brother peter is the film's finest example of both day lewis and <UNK> efforts it's built up to so well by sheridan that it comes out when we're ready and day lewis takes us from there with his stunning work br br the other strong <UNK> of the film is brenda <UNK> as mrs brown i did not know she'd won the oscar but there was something about her performances as <UNK> loving and wise mother that just screamed oscar worthy her love for christy and constant fighting for him just seems so convincing and heartfelt and she earns a lot of sympathy given her situation br br the emotional punch of the film given the story is surprisingly minimal perhaps that was part of the sacrifice of trying to create a film that feels <UNK> human the two should be <UNK> but i imagine it's challenging to tell a story that feels true to life and one that provides enough dramatic moments to take our emotions on a roller coaster the choice to <UNK> the latter was definitely the wise one for my left foot <UNK> circumstances speak for themselves they don't need to be <UNK> for <UNK> dramatic impact br br steven c br br visit my site <UNK> com for more
<START> as a lover of bad movies i definitely hit <UNK> with this one the plot isn't really that bad but there are a few instances where you really have to ask yourself what the heck is going on here br br there are many many things that make this the funniest bad movie ever first off <UNK> ray moore had gotten so fat and slow when this movie was filmed that the special effects consist of <UNK> up the fight scenes to double time there are also scenes where there is a slow motion instant replay jumping onto a ten foot high wall by playing falling off of it backwards naked men walking out of huge letters and sex that literally brings down the roof with the cable holding up the roof catching on fire br br of course no <UNK> ray moore movie would be complete without a completely gratuitous and random comedy club scene where <UNK> makes fun of all the customers <UNK> with people doing some odd dance there are so many things bad about this movie but they're bad in an entertaining way and if you take your eyes off the movie you might miss another mistake br br rating 1 10 for actual value 10 10 for cheese factor 10 10 for picking out mistakes and goofs <UNK> out to 7 10
<START> i watched shore leave the other day i've seen it so many times and i never get tired of it strangely enough every time i watch it lately it takes me right back to the very first time i saw it including this time must be that sense of mystery and what is going on here about it br br oddly enough the one part of the story that always felt awkward and uncomfortable for me this time actually had a huge effect on me ruth i think a lot of it was <UNK> <UNK> score a real masterpiece that the romantic section was <UNK> much more <UNK> in this side of paradise but of course it <UNK> here i get the impression that out of all the girls kirk knew over the years she may have been the <UNK> when she said do you have to go combined with the music i could really feel the pain she must have felt at not being able to have him stay with her br br someone commented online that ruth looked older than he was yet she wasn't supposed to have aged at all in 15 years which makes me think maybe she was one of the teachers at the academy kirk had an affair with an older woman perhaps he thought back to this in <UNK> when he told <UNK> i never get involved with older women maybe he meant anymore br br reading st reviews the other day i see where someone compared what are little girls made of with i <UNK> but it seems shore leave <UNK> be in there too what are all those people if not <UNK> and could the caretaker be related to the old ones from the earlier episode whoever he is he seems to be one of the rare cases in st where you have a race that is actually superior as opposed to merely thinking they are br br <UNK> <UNK> seems to be filling in for <UNK> <UNK> considering how much attention dr mccoy <UNK> on her it's just one more frustrating example of a potentially good character who appears once and then never shows up again <UNK> br br one thing missing from the last several i've watched that <UNK> back in here was spock smiling he was i saw him i really prefer knowing there's 2 sides to him going on inside all the time rather than this <UNK> business when he said enjoy yourself sir near the beginning you could see it wasn't just his addressing his superior officer but talking to his friend and at the end when he needlessly says totally illogical i can't help but think he does it purely to <UNK> a reaction he may not be smiling or laughing but i think he likes seeing his fellow crew members around him happy
<START> i haven't seen the original incredible journey since i was a child so i can't really compare the two versions this version tells the story of three animals two dogs and a cat whose owners leave them with friends in the countryside when the father of the family has to take a new job in san francisco the pets believing that they have been abandoned escape and set out on a long <UNK> journey through wilderness br br this story might have been most easily filmed as a cartoon but both versions are in fact live action films made using real animals one major difference is that in the later version the animals speak in human voices giving each its own distinct personality something that was not done in the original film a similar device of talking animals has been used in other recent children's films such as racing <UNK> some critics have been rather <UNK> about the use of this device but my own view is that giving the animals distinctive personalities of their own helps to <UNK> the film rather than <UNK> it the animals were voiced by big name stars don <UNK> michael j fox and sally fields br br both dogs are male and their relationship parallels that between many humans in buddy buddy movies shadow a golden <UNK> is the wise experienced older dog chance the younger one is <UNK> cocky and <UNK> to british eyes chance looks like a boxer but is actually an american <UNK> which is apparently a different breed to its british cousin sassy the cat is female with a rather <UNK> and proper personality she is very proud of her status as a cat which in her eyes makes her vastly superior to any mere dog cats rule dogs <UNK> br br from an adult viewpoint the film has a number of faults it can be sentimental some of the incidents such as the one in which the animals manage to <UNK> a mountain lion into the river are quite incredible and the human characters are all completely forgettable this however is a film which is mainly aimed at children and i suspect they will enjoy it immensely certainly any animal loving child will do so comments by some professional critics such as james <UNK> who complained that the <UNK> voices <UNK> the film's <UNK> only serve to <UNK> my view that professional critics are not always the best <UNK> to children's movies i doubt if many <UNK> conversations about <UNK> bound concentrated on its supposed <UNK> br br one thing adults will appreciate is the photography of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mountains they may also appreciate the film's blend of humour and excitement as the runaway pets encounter <UNK> such as bears mountain lions and <UNK> in the wilderness this is a very enjoyable family film 7 10
<START> me being of irish origins loved this movie not only was the guy hot and funny he was also sincere and honest i loved the girl who he fell in love with too she was pretty they were such a cute couple the ending was so sad love this movie although it is a little dirty it reminds of a british or irish version of prime if you liked this movie you should watch prime same story line young guy falls for older women older women falls for young guy to a lot of paths cross in the end the best decision is made or task is completed don't have anything else to say without ruining the whole movie all though i thought the french guy was ugly less appealing to me <UNK> if you like irish movies i would recommend circle of friends that movie is so good quick quote you might not get unless you watch it well thats my dinner ruined lol
<START> this show had pretty good stories but bad dialog the main character was especially annoying it's quite obvious why this show was canceled although like most <UNK> shows i never knew it even existed until it was in <UNK> re runs br br most of it's plots seemed to be copied from other shows and movies leading me to think the producers didn't have an original idea in their heads br br i haven't commented enough you've got to have at least ten lines of text the special effect were not bad for a 2001 show br br the <UNK> was a nice character
<START> this is a very very early bugs bunny cartoon as a result the character is still in a transition period he is not drawn as <UNK> as he later was and his voice isn't quite right in addition the chemistry between elmer and bugs is a little unusual elmer is some poor <UNK> who buys bugs from a pet shop there is no gun or desire on his part to blast the bunny to <UNK> however despite this this is still a very enjoyable film the early bugs was definitely more sassy and cruel than his later <UNK> in later films he messed with elmer <UNK> sam and others because they started it they messed with the rabbit but in this film he is much more like <UNK> duck of the late 30s and early 40s a jerk who just loves irritating others a true <UNK> instead of the hero of the later cartoons while this isn't among the best bug bunny cartoons it sure is fun to watch and it's interesting to see just how much he's changed over the years
<START> don't know how this missed award nominations great film certainly of the <UNK> of beautiful mind great acting photography script and drama i can't imagine anyone not being <UNK> by this film
<START> predictable parody just about failed to impress throughout it's <UNK> eight minutes the only thing that made it worthwhile was the do not <UNK> line at the end credits shame something more entertaining wasn't put on the dvd like jonathan <UNK> enjoyable profile of romero on 'the incredible strange film show '
<START> dick tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by <UNK> <UNK> he is a <UNK> detective who tracks down a crew of villains ranging from all types of visually original characters such as <UNK> to the blank to big boy <UNK> these villains became so popular in the 40's that warner bros created their own take on the tracy style villains in such cartoons as <UNK> duck <UNK> comics were known for their liberal use of <UNK> and the up to date technology advances notably the <UNK> <UNK> which got their fair share of screen time on this excellent movie the music was done wonderfully by danny <UNK> and the original songs by madonna were interesting but they were not the high point for her career it's weird because as you watch the film and see the suspenseful moments the film feels so much like batman because of <UNK> memorable sound to his pieces br br i love the tough talking kid <UNK> acting as big boy <UNK> and that <UNK> <UNK> take on <UNK> and the cinematography and directing were impeccable this film was very <UNK> made and features tons of great actors who were known as great actors for a while before this film was made warren beatty al pacino william forsythe dustin hoffman kathy bates mandy <UNK> catherine o'hara dick van dyke the film was directed by beatty himself which was interesting it is almost like beatty saw himself as tracy in a past life or something because he really fit the part br br i had to give this film an 8 10 for everything that it brought to cinema that got overlooked for whatever reason there have been tons of <UNK> over the rating of this movie on imdb and i still don't understand why the characters were completely original and vibrant as was the style of the sets wardrobe lighting and everything in this film go buy it today you will not be sorry
<START> the year 2005 saw no fewer than 3 filmed productions of h g <UNK> great novel war of the worlds this is perhaps the least well known and very probably the best of them no other version of <UNK> has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place the last year of the 19th century <UNK> ¬Ö using <UNK> original setting in and near <UNK> england br br imdb seems <UNK> to what they regard as spoilers that might apply with some films where the ending might actually be a surprise but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world it seems positively silly i have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the <UNK> works in english literature so let's get right to the chase the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease against which they have no <UNK> if that's a spoiler so be it after a book and 3 other films including the 1953 classic you ought to know how this ends br br this film which follows <UNK> plot in the main is also very cleverly presented ¬ñ in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late 19th early 20th century photography although filmed in a widescreen aspect the film goes to some <UNK> to give an impression of <UNK> the general <UNK> of skin and clothes display a <UNK> <UNK> often found in old photographs rather than black colors are often reminiscent of hand <UNK> at other times colors are washed out these variations are typical of early films which didn't use <UNK> celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality even going from black white to <UNK> white to blue white to <UNK> white and so on ¬ñ as you'll see on occasion here the special effects are deliberately <UNK> of a sort seen even as late as the 1920s ¬ñ and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have a more nearly realistic feel some of effects are really awkward ¬ñ such as the destruction of big ben the acting is often more in the style of that period than <UNK> some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd particularly the use of <UNK> or <UNK> on head and facial hair br br this film is the only one that follows with some <UNK> <UNK> original narrative ¬ñ as has been noted viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally <UNK> in other versions of the story <UNK> description of the martians ¬ñ a giant head <UNK> on numerous <UNK> ¬ñ is effectively portrayed when the martian machines appear about an hour into the film they too give a good impression of how wells described them both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective primarily of rural england ¬ñ plus a few scenes in london involving the <UNK> brother the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark big ben but at least doesn't <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> of london br br the victory of the martians is hardly a surprise despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines the narrator traveling about to seek escape sees much of what wells terms the <UNK> of mankind he encounters a <UNK> <UNK> with the victorian <UNK> of a much too precious and nervous personality they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest where they discover an awful fact the martians are shown to be vampires who <UNK> their prey alive in a very effective scene wells adds that after eating they set up a prolonged and cheerful <UNK> the narrator finally is <UNK> to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical <UNK> ¬ñ who <UNK> just as the martians drag him off to the <UNK> cheers from the gallery british <UNK> are so often utterly <UNK> br br this film lasts almost 3 hours going through <UNK> story in welcome detail it's about time the author got his due ¬ñ in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact a word about the acting don't expect award winning performances they're not bad however the actors are earnest and they grow on you most of them however have had very <UNK> film careers often only in this film the narrator is played by hunky anthony <UNK> in his 2nd film the <UNK> is john kaufman ¬ñ also in his 2nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing the brother henderson is played with some conviction by w bernard <UNK> in his first film the <UNK> the only other <UNK> part is played by james <UNK> in his first film br br this is overall a splendid film portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it despite its slight <UNK> it is far and away better than any of its hyped up <UNK> if you want to see h g <UNK> war of the worlds ¬ñ and not some wholly distorted version of it ¬ñ see this film
<START> a true classic beautifully filmed and acted reveals an area of paris which is alive and filled with comedy and tragedy although the area of <UNK> du <UNK> and the hotel itself still exists it is not as gay in the original sense of the word and <UNK> as it once must have been the film makes one <UNK> for the past which has been lost with a sigh and <UNK>
<START> i'll start by relating my first encounter with <UNK> music it was in a bar on my <UNK> birthday and a girl was dancing bare <UNK> to 1999 playing on the <UNK> i asked people who is this singer i was told it was prince it was so good that it distracted me from a beautiful topless dancer later i started hearing other prince songs and really digging them when purple rain came out i still knew very little about this fellow <UNK> the movie blew me away i instantly became <UNK> no 1 fan of the war baby generation later i found out one of my cousins was his secretary and she got me and my nephew into a v i p prince concert where we sat next to his mother how cool is that getting back to the topic at hand i agree with <UNK> ebert who called purple rain an instant classic i have seen it over 17 times and absolutely love it i thought <UNK> acting was fine <UNK> <UNK> a bit but all in all the acting was fine john gielgud was not available to play 'the <UNK> so prince took the role the film is visually stunning brilliantly paced it never gets slow and <UNK> directed i rank it among the best movie musicals of all time the last time i watched it was after about a 7 year gap and it still delivered i am so proud of fellow <UNK> prince rogers nelson and would love to tell him personally he walked right in front of me during the above mentioned concert and said hi to my nephew but not me he was <UNK> with his mom i was a bit crushed but he's still no 1 with me
<START> i mean of all the obscure overlooked low budget horror movies waiting to be re discovered in a dvd release why pick the forest i love ultra low budget direct to home video or other alternative release horror i love 80s <UNK> horror i love backwoods slashers with fools wandering off into the night to be chased murdered and eaten by <UNK> i am all for the idea of non professionals working on a horror movie as a way to maybe break into the industry or just making a movie because they want to make one i am all for using found public locations non actors no name talent behind the camera and in the studio no problem the most <UNK> image from the forest is it's opening shot of a couple walking in the distance across a forest into the woods we see them as tiny vulnerable creatures entering a <UNK> gloomy world where humans may not be the top of the food chain or most feared predator then the film takes a dive never <UNK> we briefly meet the <UNK> couple just as they realize that they are being stalked they get separated both are butchered and then we meet the movie's protagonists as they drive their car in a traffic jam they meet up with their respective mates and decide to take a camping trip sounds of <UNK> fill the room as people who came over to watch a movie <UNK> with their cell phones text <UNK> people not there telling them how much the movie sucks br br this film is too slow this movie is too boring and this movie is too talky which wouldn't be such a bad thing if the writers had given the people something to say other than the most stupid <UNK> and unnecessary things you know your horror movie is in trouble when the character with the most interesting lines is the <UNK> faced park ranger who warns everyone away from the cannibal woods and speaking of these woods they look about as far away from civilization as the <UNK> <UNK> lot behind the soccer fields only with bigger rocks and a stream flowing through it there are impressive shots of the forest <UNK> but no real sense of being out in the middle of it if any one of the characters just sat down on the trail and waited long enough someone would <UNK> by br br what is worse about the film is that it fails to generate any human interest i don't know who these couples are and don't care what happens to them the <UNK> cannibal slasher guy is uninteresting even when pretending to saw <UNK> <UNK> meat off the leg of one of his victims to serve grisly bites to her boyfriend who just happens to seek shelter in his cave the irony of which is the epitome of <UNK> coupled with a deliberately ominous <UNK> music score cinematography that <UNK> looks like someone <UNK> a camera on a dog and it follow people's movements a lack of <UNK> gore nudity lurid thrills and <UNK> atmosphere and what we have here is a horror movie that isn't even as frightening as a <UNK> educational tv show about how <UNK> work br br i don't mean to dish it out to the people behind this film since they obviously went into the project with next to nothing did not push themselves to be creative and ended up with just another boring movie about some <UNK> chasing women through the woods with a knife there is nothing wrong with that concept what is wrong is the unimaginative and utterly pedestrian way this was executed right down to the utterly pointless conclusion when the film simply peters out at about the 80 minute mark the best thing that you can say about the forest is that it is over relatively quickly and there isn't much to command a repeat screening hence my confusion at why anyone would feel the need for a dvd release it was fine as a <UNK> video rental years <UNK> as a dvd it will be 5 99 rack fare inside a month of hitting the shelves there is little or no urgency to see the film unless you are considering making your own ultra low budget backwoods <UNK> set in a public park where nobody can charge you money for filming there here is a guide of steps to avoid making br br with all that said and done the film did have one interesting sequence or rather one sequence that was so pathetic and <UNK> thought out that it becomes an <UNK> in an otherwise cut <UNK> film the madman comes home to find his wife in bed with the local <UNK> he <UNK> his beloved arms himself with a kitchen knife that looks like it was made just to be used in a horror film and takes off after the <UNK> the guy <UNK> and attacks his <UNK> who <UNK> runs away only to have the psycho <UNK> in his footsteps with a bigger <UNK> weapon the psycho attacks again and the guy gets away the psycho <UNK> again and once more the guy gets away then again finally on the fifth try the psycho <UNK> the dude so to fall on some sort of a <UNK> <UNK> how did he keep <UNK> armed with bigger <UNK> weapons like that is there some supernatural element to this psycho since the film never makes it clear either way the scene is just an <UNK> staged to build some tension it's purpose remains unclear the whole film is like that really existing without any need to be made and executed in such a ham <UNK> uninteresting manner that one cannot help but wonder what the point of it was br br 3 10 and ample evidence that just because you can release a movie on dvd that doesn't mean you necessarily should
<START> this movie joshua is extremely disturbing and downright pointless it actually makes me <UNK> to think there are people who would enjoy watching it without giving away the story it is about a young boy's reaction to his <UNK> sister and that is just the tip of the iceberg during the entirety of this movie the viewer is subjected to some of the most unsettling child behavior imaginable adding insult to injury by the end of this movie there is absolutely no real outcome except the <UNK> of pure evil at the hands of a child no less who <UNK> a whole group of dumb adults there is no redemption no justice served and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is going on around them frankly i did not enjoy watching this movie it was extremely unsettling even for those who might enjoy horror movies this movie could be too much despite the fact this movie was well acted the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to a 90 minute wait in a <UNK> waiting room in anticipation of some painful dental <UNK>
<START> as others have mentioned this movie is similar to the fly both versions and the lesser known sci fi flick altered states the big difference is that those two movies were well made by people who knew what they were doing and were good at it <UNK> did not have these <UNK> <UNK> is a potentially interesting science fantasy story that had the wrong people in charge of it and the wrong actors playing the roles br br the story follows scientist dr peter <UNK> gene <UNK> an obsessed man working on a genetic cure to aging and death when the university he works for threatens to cut funding he decides to <UNK> the anti aging serum into himself as a result dr <UNK> spends the rest of the movie slowly turning into a lizard and oh yes watching the good doctor go through the process of becoming that lizard is a great joy it really is so bad that it's good some of the lines are classic what was it a nightmare from the past br br many of the reviews that i've read for this point up how stupid and ridiculous the last five minutes of this movie are i'm just going to go ahead and spoil it the good doctor goes from being a <UNK> half man half lizard thing to being what appears to be a man in a rejected godzilla costume when the police finally gun him down in the final scene some obnoxious kid is seen with a little pet lizard which he claims will never die and the movie's heroine sally <UNK> catherine <UNK> evidently decides that the little lizard is the final incarnation of dr <UNK> the camera then gives us a close up of the <UNK> face this is i assume the director's way of showing us that the lizard is evil yes it is goofy but i fell over laughing so i can't complain br br i watched this movie because it was a part of the chilling classics 50 movie <UNK> that i purchased i'm sure many of those who are reading this did exactly the same thing as the 50 pack is the only way to see this movie on dvd if you have recently bought the <UNK> set and haven't watched this movie yet it really is worth your time even if i did just ruin the ending for you it might also be possible to find this movie online for free
<START> although this film put davis on the map due to her brilliantly intense performance as the illiterate <UNK> waitress prostitute mildred rogers this film is strangely unsatisfying to me as a whole the acting is indeed fine in most every respect what i cannot <UNK> for the life of me is just how or why phillip a sensitive well <UNK> young man would take the constant abuse this tramp constantly <UNK> out towards him i find his naive tolerance quite ridiculously unbelievable in certain respects yes i know he is a sensitive club <UNK> <UNK> intellectual but davis is such a <UNK> witch that nobody that <UNK> would tolerate her attitude or actions and make it believable davis is astounding in her role yes she may go overboard in her <UNK> now and then but it's a vividly creative portrayal any which way you look at it too bad she wasn't playing a <UNK> <UNK> her character would have been completely believable as a tramp among low <UNK>
<START> oh my gosh i live in kentucky and when <UNK> joan hart came to <UNK> she went right through my neighborhood and <UNK> at me i am filthy rich so she wanted to look at my neighborhood oh and i love being rich any ways she came for the <UNK> back to my interest in the show that show makes you want to point your finger at something and make it disappear i mean it is just so creative and i love it i would love to be on that show that show is just amazing i mean who ever came up with that show i want to just give them a big kiss i mean it makes me feel better when i'm sick and makes me happy when i'm mad i mean if someone tells me they don't like it i will talk some sense in to you ok ok
<START> the cat and mouse are involved in the usual chases when jerry <UNK> into a bottle of invisible <UNK> and discovers that it makes him <UNK> instead of <UNK> the opportunity to go spy on a girl mouse changing room or something he uses his new found <UNK> to torment tom and it's pretty funny and quite inventive despite being a somewhat one joke cartoon and the action never leaves the interior of the house which is usually the <UNK> of below average t j shorts still worth a 7 10 br br however i'm not sure how an invisible mouse can cast a shadow on the wall it defies physics and the very nature of being invisible itself
<START> spoilers br br while the historical accuracy might be questionable and with the mass appeal of the inaccurate lotr such things are more easily <UNK> now i liked the art <UNK> of it though not really an art house film it does provide a little emotionally charged scenes from time to time br br i have two complaints 1 it's too short and 2 the voice you hear <UNK> from time to time is not explained br br 8 10 br br quality 10 10 entertainment 7 10 <UNK> 5 10
<START> the film is pretty confusing and ludicrous the plot is awful but on the plus side the acting is pretty good with a few good shouts and <UNK> sharon stone is ok this time not even half as good as the original mind you the murders aren't as gory as the first one either which is a shame its not the unpredictable mess everyone say it is though the sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake they are fully <UNK> the script is weak most of the time but the scenes with banter and arguments between dr glass and <UNK> are highlights the plot twists a few times but the ending is awful the tension is always constant with a huge <UNK> of <UNK> my god ' the chase sequences are brilliantly directed and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise rush felt film sharon stone is a bit old for this too the bits where we see her breasts were in the first one <UNK> this time around they are too horrid to describe the films its self is rather average but it is worth a go mainly because the film does deserve some good buzz with the opening sequence being a highlight not to be critical but if you liked the first one leave this one don't ruin the run you'll be glad you left this stone <UNK>
<START> this is the worst show <UNK> of grown up acting like kids no humor nothing even <UNK> street has better humor and more adult than friends friends may be the worst thing i've ever seen on television and i've been sitting in front of the tube <UNK> friends simply does not stack up well to other contemporary series it lacks the <UNK> of seinfeld and the wonderful self <UNK> of <UNK> that is the hallmark of <UNK> the characters in friends seem designed to make them <UNK> <UNK> this incestuous group of neighbors makes my flesh crawl br br the <UNK> show is completely without an edge of any sort the characters are caricatures of caricatures and the writing is <UNK> though intentionally so it might be interesting to observe a writing session since the writers may have to slave to aim lower than their <UNK> so as not to confuse the loyal friends of friends
<START> what a terrible movie rotten tomatoes had a good rating for this too don't be fooled by the positive comments it wasn't scary it wasn't funny it wasn't clever it won't even hold your attention i just wasted 2 hours of my life viewing this crap fest the computer generated monster was interesting to see the first couple times after about 15 minutes it no longer entertained the dialogue was terrible must be a translation thing another negative that stood out was the idiot americans 3 were portrayed and they were all lacking character intelligence and judgment now i will write a couple of lines to pad this since we have to have 10 the employees at the video store should have slapped me for bringing this title to the counter
<START> this movie is a cringe fest of bad acting and poor set design as well as tacky lines and a lame plot but it is so much fun to watch everything about it is hilarious the basic plot is a group of scientists from the future travel back in time to capture their evil co worker who is intent on destroying them all they catch up with him in the year <UNK> the <UNK> lab of the scientists from the year <UNK> is an eighties style room with a bunch of <UNK> flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed the actors deliver their lines with <UNK> <UNK> which isn't hard to understand considering that the lines are usually earth <UNK> like i double checked everything twice he double checked everything twice he checked it four times not only that but they feed you the entire premise of the movie in the first five minutes and continue at a rapid fire pace until they hit the medieval part when roger corman ran out of money and had to stop travelling through time and consequently different sets the medieval set is a comic <UNK> mash of anything from the late <UNK> century to the <UNK> century any costume they could find they used i guess chain mail wasn't on the budget 'cause the guys all wear <UNK> shirts <UNK> as armor the fight scenes are laughable with men casually throwing themselves onto cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death throws with <UNK> a blow cast it sounds truly awful but i enjoy it every time i watch it the lines alone are enough to have you in fits and everything else pulls together to create a fabulous b movie that if you are a <UNK> of corny flicks i would suggest you see and once you have read the review on unknown movies i love hearing them point out all the funny truly awful bits in the movie
<START> i've seen many horror shows over the years like <UNK> that dealt with the wendigo legend so i was looking forward to an angry spirit causing mayhem to add flavor to the halloween season man was i mistaken the whole movie creates this sense of events about to happen that will be scary and creepy but then delivers a very simplistic tale of revenge and murder over the loss of some property <UNK> <UNK> scary not this movie has a lot in common with cold creek <UNK> another total loser br br it's getting harder and harder to believe anything hollywood puts forward about scary movies since they rarely come through with anything original and spooky anymore what idiots pay for such a bogus movie to be made go back to the drawing board <UNK> and do something useful with those millions of <UNK> you have to throw around
<START> when this cartoon first aired i was under the impression that it would be at least half way descent boy was i wrong i must admit watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching batman and robin with george clooney all those years ago i watched a few episodes and two of them had batman literally get his ass kicked left and right by the penguin who fought like jet li and beat the crap out of batman and i watched another episode where batman got his butt kicked again by the joker who apparently was using jackie chan moves while flipping in the air like a ninja since when were the joker or the penguin ever a match for batman and worse yet when were joker and penguin kung fu counterparts of jackie chan and jet li it's truly embarrassing depressing and sad the way the image of batman is portrayed in this show the animation is awful and the dialog is terrible being a batman fan since my <UNK> i can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all cost because it doesn't project the true image of batman this cartoon is more like a wannabe kung fu flick and if you really wanna see a classic batman cartoon i strongly recommend batman the animated series but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of s t get batman the <UNK> series and don't waste your time with this cartoon
<START> how did i ever appreciate this dud of a sequel all it does is throw balls worst of all it doesn't compare to even the first installment of the series the comedy suffers from not being funny where did all the unintentional laughter go enough slapstick on the field action goes on too long bob <UNK> literally saved this one from a complete nine <UNK> <UNK> what's next major league 4 return to the little league <UNK> could be leave this one on the shelf and plan a trip to the all star game this one's had three strikes too many

<START> my main problem with the film is that it goes on too long other then that it's pretty good paul muni plays a poor chinese farmer who is about to get married through an arranged marriage <UNK> rainer is a servant girl who gets married to muni they live with <UNK> father on a farm and they are doing pretty bad when he finally gets some money to buy some more land a <UNK> hits and nothing is growing everybody stars to head north by muni stays behind at first when they leave and arrive at town they find that their are no jobs and they are worse off than before they even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money but decide against it when a bunch of people start <UNK> the town the military show up and start <UNK> people paul muni does a good job and <UNK> rainer won a second oscar for this movie
<START> in this 1943 film judy garland is deemed not to be ready for the big time yet by the man who loves her van <UNK> this film was certainly a big change for mr <UNK> especially after his supporting oscar win the year before in johnny eager br br wasn't spring <UNK> too old to be the widowed mother of 5 children with four of them appearing to look like her <UNK> br br the singing and dancing are just <UNK> staged but the way that the <UNK> romance between <UNK> and garland was depicted left a lot to be desired it was a <UNK> like one where a young girl is eventually swept off her feet by a <UNK>
<START> creature unknown is the right word for this movie or maybe it should be called unknown movie this movie is a piece of crap right from the beginning it has a really stupid plot really pathetic acting and so so special effects br br some thirty something year old post teens are trapped in the woods with a mad <UNK> rubber suit creature lurking around endlessly what you get with this movie is a bunch of talk and precious little action you have girls walking through the woods talking and then you have guys with heavy <UNK> on walking through the woods talking the whole thing is so boring br br the creature itself is rarely seen throughout most of the movie when it is shown the picture is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit and the movement shows that it is a suit hence the reason for the <UNK> and <UNK> of the image br br this is not a good movie in any since of the word and the ones here who have praised it are most likely the people that were picked up off the street to act in this truly <UNK> movie skip this one for certain
<START> i never bothered to see this movie in theaters although i remember hearing the name over and over i finally watched it this week and what a delight for some reason i was expecting it to not be very good so i was completely surprised when i sat down and stuck with it and then found myself completely pulled in i read a lot of the other user comments and it impressed me how much people talk about her fighting in the ring but what was wonderful about diana is that she's a true fighter in life all she needs to do is find her place where she be who she is and the ring helps her to get there a very intelligent story and i'm amazed that this is the first time up for michelle rodriguez what an excellent job she did adrian and her coach were also quite good br br this film is a little rough around the edges but it doesn't matter in the slightest the story the will and the performances completely <UNK> any flaws that usually come with indie filmmaking anyway a compelling portrayal of a girl finding herself and <UNK> over her circumstances and a k o for michelle rodriguez

<START> all the acting done in the first season has been really amazing the first look you get of max and <UNK> is through <UNK> locke and chris <UNK> or as i like to call them the <UNK> the <UNK> do the best acting job that i have ever seen kids do the main actors and actresses i e jessica alba michael <UNK> etc make you forget you are watching a fictional t v show they seem to make this show come alive all in all this is the best show i have ever watched
<START> usually musicals in the 1940's were of a set formula and if you studied films you know what i'm talking about a certain running <UNK> very <UNK> performances that were great on the surface but never got into the real personalities of the characters etc br br this one is different and light years better and well worth it's nomination for best picture of the year 1945 although had no chance of beating the eventual winner lost weekend br br gene kelly was probably in the best form of his career yes i know about american in paris and singing in the rain this one is different he really gets into his character of a sea wolf thinking at first that picking up any girl while on leave is nothing more than a <UNK> and if you had to make up a story to get her so be it until sort of like the music man when he gets his foot caught in the door the eventual hilarity of the film <UNK> mostly from his and his new pal sinatra 's attempt to make the story good in order to get the girl that he really and unexpectedly falls in love with you are going to have to see the movie to see what i mean br br besides that there are so many other elements of great film in this one it's a classic buddy story nostalgia to a time when wwii was almost over the war ended about a month after the films release a realization that a guy that always laughed at life can find out that he really is a great human being great songs and probably a few other elements of classic film making that i can't think of right now br br why not a 10 near the end at nearly 2 1 2 hours starts to feel a bit long there is a small ballet number that gene kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now but overall this ones a definite winner on every level
<START> that film is absolutely fantastic if you watch it with your friends it can be a very nice day obviously you have to know that the film is stupid and very bad directed and acted <UNK> <UNK> what a couple and that is probably the worse film in the world but you can enjoy it very much we watched it in 19 and it was a very nice evening the best scenes are the first one when the criminals kill the friend of alex and he tries to act like a desperate and the result is a comic scene of first category and then when he shows to <UNK> <UNK> what a name the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and then the accident of <UNK> that once is going on her car out of the road and a second later the car is completely empty what a magic
<START> with the exception of family this new season is worse than season one i can't imagine what they are thinking as a fan of horror can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem but this series gets worse with each outing i can't imagine how <UNK> it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day <UNK> to <UNK> out such crap story is that too much to ask for character how can we give damn about the fate of anyone in these stories if we are not engaged who cares if they get <UNK> up or whatever almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or reason why we have been subjected to an hour of <UNK> even <UNK> effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and <UNK> off to a pointless conclusion ironically the production values and performances tend to be up to speed while the content is utter crap i have great hopes for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> under the stairs but we shall see
<START> horrible horrible horrible do not waste your money to rent this movie its like a low budget made for tv canadian movie absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen and there have been many others out there this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the dvd player or vcr is it possible to write ten lines the acting was horrific it had absolutely no flow i saw the made for tv movie on the btk killer and it was much better in comparison to this one i am not sure what they were going for in producing this film but if it was to <UNK> us or tell a story about the btk killer they missed by a mile it appeared to be more of a <UNK> for animal rights
<START> amazing that's what you'd say if you sat through this film simply incredibly amazing it's actually so amazing that anyone was stupid enough to dump money into making this monstrosity that you simply can't believe what you're seeing that my friends is what is truly scary about this film somebody thought it was a good idea to make it br br well here's another amazingly original story high school student occasionally seemed like <UNK> figure has whore for a mom lives in a trailer park and is an artist who is <UNK> for his being all different well of course this poor <UNK> boy is eventually killed and here's the original part his soul <UNK> a scarecrow beneath which he is killed by his <UNK> <UNK> latest john then he goes around with the standard killing off of all the people that done hurt him <UNK> br br here's the breakdown br br the good br br amazingly funny <UNK> if that's not what the clearly drunk filmmakers wanted br br this and the sequel on one <UNK> in the wal mart 5 00 <UNK> it's only a little <UNK> br br didn't hurt it didn't help br br the violence and gore are kind of sub standard one person is stabbed with a <UNK> br br sounds like they put some effort into the <UNK> it doesn't really fit the <UNK> isn't all that good br br the bad br br terrible terrible acting br br another slasher let down with sexy <UNK> of them <UNK> clothing when did that <UNK> being a <UNK> of low brow slashers br br ridiculous story br br the scarecrow <UNK> up one liners that would make freddy krueger and arnold <UNK> <UNK> br br standard underlying love story goes nowhere and is poorly done br br some of the people killed seem like they were chosen at <UNK> never really know who anybody is and then they're killed and you only assume that they must've had it coming br br the ugly br br extremely average slasher fare just with a murdering scarecrow instead <UNK> well all that other crap br br nowhere near as interesting as freddy krueger jason <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or even angela from the <UNK> camp <UNK> of which are better than this atrocity br br the absolute worst dialogue i have ever heard in my life the script is laden with a level of <UNK> that i never imagined could exist i'm serious <UNK> a full step beyond terrible don't get me wrong though it's funny as <UNK> i've never heard more <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> party massacre iii this film makes jason x look like shakespeare br br the man who kills the boy that becomes the scarecrow worst wig ever dialogue to match br br memorable scene br br the one where <UNK> school <UNK> <UNK> out their own witty dialogue hey let's go find small animals to torture huh huh br br acting 3 10 story 3 10 atmosphere 2 10 cinematography 1 10 character development 2 10 special effects make up 5 10 nudity sexuality 1 10 no nudity mom's a whore girls wear no <UNK> violence gore 5 10 low quality mediocre amount dialogue 0 10 extremely ridiculous blatant over the top and painfully <UNK> bad it's good my first rating for dialogue in any film music 5 10 direction 2 10 br br cheesiness 10 10 <UNK> 9 10 br br overall 3 10 br br another one for just people like me who enjoy watching pure crap or slasher film <UNK> this is not a good movie at all laughable dialogue and characters keep it from being truly boring br br www <UNK> com
<START> the main reason i wanted to see this movie was because of the wonderful cast a ton of my favorite actors in one movie equals amazing with out actually seeing it but this movie caught me off guard it wasn't what i was expecting at all it's been a while since i've seen it but i do remember i could not stop laughing and it wasn't just the cast that did it for me the script was amazingly written every time you were expecting something to happen it didn't happen there were so many twists and turns but it fit with the whole tone of the movie instead of coming off as pretentious the cinematography along with the set was absolutely beautiful as well i really can't say anything bad about this movie <UNK> i would have andrew <UNK> a little more screen time
<START> the folk who produced this masterful film have done fine service to a novel that stands as perhaps the best fiction work <UNK> upon human guilt and human responsibility ever published nolte takes the role of howard w campbell jr and makes it his own remaining true to <UNK> depiction of a man who has lost all to and for love br br no weaknesses in this fine adaptation
<START> the daughter's words are poetry i can't go on another year i got to get to a hotel room i lost my blue <UNK> in a sea of leaves the <UNK> <UNK> is moving in he just gave us a <UNK> machine that's the deal i'm <UNK> by this latest thing <UNK> and cats become a little bit boring for too long a time any little <UNK> nest mouse hole i'd like better and there is wisdom in the mother's words yes the pleasure is all mine this little book will keep me straight straight as a <UNK> always one must do everything correctly where the hell did you come from bring me my little radio i've got to have some professional music i'm your mother remember me the mother daughter relationship is drawn in this magnificent film this is a mother's day film
<START> going into seeing this movie i was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea especially a romantic fantasy br br little did i know that i was in for a ride through cinematic magic everything in the movie from plot to dialogue to effects was very near perfection br br claire danes shines like the star she is in this movie from beginning to end you fall more and more in love with this character br br michelle pfeiffer is menacing as an evil witch bent on capturing the star for eternal youth and beauty br br robert de niro is a lovable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of comic relief as the movie is gaining momentum towards the climax br br overall this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan if you are looking for a fun and enjoyable movie that will be fun for the kids and adults alike stardust is the way to go
<START> this was one of the worst movies ever it was so bad i was laughing through the whole movie the plot was so cheesy especially the end this movie turns from an end of the world disaster to save the <UNK> i mean c'mon and i swear i think they use <UNK> puppets for the <UNK> and there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced how predictable it was so terrible that my mom my sister and i couldn't finish it and when we did finish it it was about a year later the second time we watched it and we finished it this time we did mst3k like comments throughout the movie br br summary only watch this if you're a movie <UNK> make hilarious comments watch this at a <UNK> for laughs and i mean huge laughs also watch for mockery the metaphor that explains this movie this movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and <UNK> puppets
<START> it is considered fashion to highlight every social evil as a result of <UNK> and male <UNK> however moronic this illogical <UNK> may be however within the story and theme of the film there is no grey area and the woman who should be called the film's antagonist is the <UNK> of the <UNK> under no circumstances can what she did be justified sexuality of women is just hype in this case and has nothing to do with the <UNK> it is betrayal of the ultimate sort the man ended up spending his resources and time in the <UNK> raising of another man's <UNK> to top it all the most feeble of arguments raised by the 3 <UNK> female characters in the climax is pathetic a woman's sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually <UNK> her husband and worse there are no other children so in essence his life has been wasted in some societies where justice still <UNK> such situations result in the execution of the <UNK>
<START> what can i say about a tale such as this this magical tale has followed me from my early childhood <UNK> warm memories in my heart the characters take you to to so many whimsical places making you want more of each scene for example in the market there were so many different <UNK> of <UNK> i loved the exotic dancers that accompanied the steel drums br br the story line was wonderful i wanted so badly for <UNK> to decide to keep the <UNK> children and for her to also stay with mr brown and find the other half of the spell so that the men less armor could win the war br br i am still a child inside and this movie appeals to my inner child like no other this movie is my definite favorite of all times i hope that all children will be able to watch this classic and be swept away and transported into another time
<START> this is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite <UNK> gershwin and a nice <UNK> atmosphere which gives the movie a lot of charm but in terms of a story well it's not really there or at least not very well worked out the acting is also not so smooth by caron but i liked some of the dialogues i liked the scene at the <UNK> i liked the character played by <UNK> the colors and the dancing of course which is quite magnificent br br a 7 5 8 seems on the <UNK> to me
<START> canadian director vincenzo natali took the art house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent cube which is my personal favourite sf film of the 90s it framed the basic <UNK> of a group of strangers trapped in a <UNK> shaped like a giant cube shot entirely on one set and took this idea in fascinating directions br br i've been eagerly awaiting <UNK> follow up and although its taken five years for him to <UNK> another project i'm delighted to say it was worth the wait cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man's place in the world and how through a completely logical chain of events finds himself in a situation beyond his control br br i don't want to reveal too much about the plot because one of the <UNK> of cypher is the different <UNK> it takes us down it is so refreshing in this day and age to see a sf film that has more than one idea in it's head cypher is such a film br br morgan sullivan jeremy northam one of the <UNK> people to ever walk the planet is hired by the company <UNK> they send him to different parts of america to record different <UNK> to his <UNK> they are unbelievably boring covering topics as mundane as <UNK> cream and cheese br br while morgan is waiting for one <UNK> he runs into rita foster an <UNK> cast lucy liu the definition of an ice maiden she gives him the brush off but there is something to her he finds irresistible that's not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in br br when rita turns up at another one of <UNK> <UNK> she tells him his life is not what it appears and i'm not saying anything more about the plot to do so would <UNK> the impact the rest of the film has on us as well as the <UNK> path that's so much fun to follow br br as with cube natali shows quite a talent for <UNK> seemingly ordinary people taking them out of the familiar and basically seeing what will happen when they're thrust into the unknown and cypher follows similar <UNK> but it's not a <UNK> copy of cube it has it's own inspiration br br cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories one of the great things about cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge when morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle it's as much of a shock to us as it is to him br br one thing that <UNK> cypher from cube is how much more polished it is where cube was confined to a <UNK> setting and a <UNK> budget with a cast of <UNK> cypher is also on a low budget but natali <UNK> it as much as he can allowing him to <UNK> the horizon and <UNK> morgan on an amazing journey through the <UNK> of his own identity br br <UNK> direction is exceptional with a <UNK> hand on the <UNK> there are some amazing camera angles from above such as the <UNK> of the <UNK> building as a vast <UNK> office block in <UNK> to the insignificant <UNK> that is morgan standing outside all the colour appears to have been <UNK> out of the picture which <UNK> the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film noir br br the acting is uniformly excellent throughout jeremy northam is a sympathetic figure from his <UNK> marriage to questioning his own identity his performance is excellent because it's so <UNK> he literally seems to <UNK> right before our very eyes from a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to a confident man who will do anything to <UNK> his new identity br br david <UNK> puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in cube he <UNK> in a secret <UNK> that looks like it was borrowed from men in black his scene is one of the best because it's an exercise in carefully <UNK> suspense and paranoia he is a supposed expert in <UNK> double agents and it's a fantastic piece of writing brilliantly acted by <UNK> all he has to do is look at morgan and we're drawn into his complex mind game br br but it's lucy liu who's the scene <UNK> here too often she is cast in films where her potential is not <UNK> to full effect but in cypher she is finally given a character that fits her like a <UNK> rita is an <UNK> <UNK> femme fatale that liu <UNK> with <UNK> i <UNK> up every time she appeared because she is always in control and can <UNK> a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone br br things come to a very <UNK> end that doesn't conclude on an ambiguous note the way cube did but morgan deserves his happy ending after he's been put through the <UNK> like this i <UNK> for him in the final scene it's a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes br br cypher succeeds on all counts engaging shocking always entertaining it's everything that total recall wanted to be but wasn't and it comes as a refreshing <UNK> to the overwhelming and inexplicable matrix br br a fine follow up from natali and now i'm a committed fan of the man superb stuff
<START> this is a complex documentary that shows many things about early gay life to put it in perspective it was when gay was the word used for the <UNK> sexual revolution and not just gay as a <UNK> or is it still used that way today i believe most of the film comes from circa 1968 to 1989 it was released in 1993 so it's been around br br i was touched by the documentaries capturing of one man's love for another over a 20 some odd year period a love expressed in ways that only true love can be there are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain along with scenes of joy and pleasure there are scenes of life as a <UNK> sexual and life as a gay the film itself was a work of love and i believe it to be a diamond br br at the very least one will get out of this film an understanding of the devastating impact of aids as i write this i am thinking how much earlier this film seems to me to have been set the advances in medical political and social <UNK> and culture that have taken place since this film was set some 15 years ago are amazing however obviously in the case of the disease of aids itself we are not done yet heck i guess we aren't done on all <UNK> br br anyway it's just a pretty darn good documentary i'd encourage anyone that feels that they don't quite understand gay life gay issues or the <UNK> of aids to watch this film
<START> maybe television will be as brutal one day maybe <UNK> brother was only the first step in the direction stephen <UNK> <UNK> king described the end point of but enough about that if i spend too much words talking about the serious background topic of this movie i do exactly what the producers hoped by choosing this material it's the same with <UNK> <UNK> day no matter how primitive the film is it <UNK> a discussion about its topic which serves the producers as publicity let's not be taken in by that the social criticism that is suggested by that plot summary is only an <UNK> to make it possible to produce a <UNK> violent movie more for video sale than for cinema br br i didn't read the book i don't dare <UNK> stephen king without having read him but when i saw the film i thought they couldn't make such a terrible film out of a good book in a typical 1980s set with 1980s music and some minor actors arnold <UNK> finds himself as a policeman running away from killers within a cruel tv show the audience is cheering br br together with <UNK> this is definitely <UNK> most stupid movie 2 stars out of 10
<START> poor whoopi goldberg imagine her at a friend's dinner party and she adds a comment to the in depth political discussion going on people just look at her and say oh what would you know you were the star of <UNK> <UNK> how could anyone take her seriously after she <UNK> herself to be the star of this appalling piece of crap even little kids would be cringing in horror at this thing it reminded me of a particularly bad episode of <UNK> and the sea <UNK> actually come to think of it <UNK> was vastly superior to this br br and however did it get made by <UNK> the producer with an illegal substance before telling him about it watch this hideous abomination at your own peril
<START> i have a 5 minute rule sometimes i'll leave <UNK> for 10 if a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes it's probably not going to ever get better i have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory dan in real life is definitely no exception i was watching this turkey and thought wow this is not funny not touching not sad and i don't like any of the characters at all br br the story of an advice <UNK> widower raising three young daughters who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend i suppose the <UNK> would be advice <UNK> who could use advice i don't know <UNK> character in no way struck me as someone <UNK> to give advice i guess that's the irony i don't know he goes to see his parents brothers sisters and their kids at some sort of <UNK> family <UNK> which seems very sweet and potential fodder for good comedy story lines none which ever emerge the central story is basically how he loves this woman but can't have her anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he will get her but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny trite lifetime movie network dialogue murderer of love to get to the inevitable happy ending br br this is truly one of the worst movies i've ever seen
<START> this film is so bad it simply defies reality the filming is grade school material at best the acting is pathetic and the director should forever be <UNK> from film making in any form so bad it can't even be watched as comedy such something along the lines of <UNK> the only thing this dvd had going for it was the cover art br br all i can write to those of you who haven't had the misfortune to witness this is to please do yourself a well deserved favor in advance and don't waste your time or your money on this piece of garbage if you want to see a movie for the comedy aspects there are many other more worthy in such a realm than this trash
<START> it's very sly for all of the 60's look to the movie the humor is quite gentle but it grew on me much more than i expected the cast is first rate and they appear to be having a wonderful time ustinov wanders through the film <UNK> some quite funny things under his breath and it's all very <UNK> i'll buy the movie as soon as it comes out on dvd the plot is that ustinov as an <UNK> released from prison posing as a computer <UNK> and <UNK> money from an american company with an office in london maggie smith is his secretary for a while and watching her get fired from many different jobs is part of the fun bob <UNK> is his usual deadpan self and karl malden has fun as the dense and sleazy executive running the london office the ending is funny and nicely cynical
<START> as a community theater actor who works hard at it but doesn't take acting too seriously i'm always amused by those who treat it as great art this movie <UNK> the actor's craft mercilessly while <UNK> up a lot of good laughs br br a ham actor on location for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator when the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drink and food the actor is kidnapped and forced to play the part of a lifetime by the neo nazi head of the secret service he plays it to the <UNK> gets the <UNK> girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa and turns the tables on his <UNK> beautifully br br lots of great <UNK> by the leads lots of good work by some unknown supporting actors particularly the household staff and two members of the palace guard and fun little cameos abound sammy davis jr makes light of himself jonathan winters plays a semi retired american businessman with something else going on and <UNK> julia <UNK> <UNK> and above all richard dreyfuss are exceptional br br this is a dumb movie but it has lots of beautiful locations in brazil a humorous script and good actors doing their thing and looking like they're actually having fun and not going through the usual existential angst about what is only play acting
<START> henry thomas was great his character held my attention i was so into the story that i forgot it wasn't real i wanted him to keep the baby and see what a special person he was the other people in the story were essential in the makeup of his character the way they <UNK> together to help one another was truly awe inspiring i love movies that show the real side of human emotions without having to hit you over the head in that you are not smart enough to figure things out for yourself
<START> i have always been somewhat <UNK> by joe <UNK> original the howling 1981 ¬ñ so i wasn't particularly interested in checking out any of its sequels some time ago i did catch howling iii the <UNK> 1987 ¬ñ by the same director as this one ¬ñ and found it to be watchable but nothing special br br the second <UNK> however has quite a bad <UNK> and i knew i'd have a good time watching it ¬ñ if mainly to <UNK> in the sight of dear but pompous horror icon christopher lee <UNK> in the midst of it all the <UNK> aged star has <UNK> <UNK> a number of times in interviews that he hasn't appeared in horror oriented fare since his last picture for hammer films back in 1976 anyway this film should have <UNK> the <UNK> your movie is a turd ¬ñ being <UNK> inept in all <UNK> beginning with the all important werewolf make up br br the plot and dialogue is not only terrible but it has the <UNK> connection with <UNK> film ¬ñ strangely enough the author of the original novel gary <UNK> co wrote this himself still one of the <UNK> highlights er low points of the film is the pointless <UNK> editing ¬ñ which tries to give the whole a semblance of style but only serves to <UNK> its embarrassment factor similarly <UNK> and grating are the hokey transitions between scenes the inane punk rock theme song and the <UNK> special effects at the climax br br what about the characters then lee is the werewolf expert naturally whom everybody thinks a <UNK> ¬ñ until they come into contact with the monsters that is at the very least though one has to admire the <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> in <UNK> a stupid <UNK> with a <UNK> meaning incidentally <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> werewolf bitch ¬ñ the <UNK> by which this is known in the u k is quite <UNK> in an assortment of outrageous s m outfits but her character is virtually given nothing to do except <UNK> over her <UNK> of followers and engage in the occasional hilarious three way <UNK> sex her two <UNK> <UNK> one of them a <UNK> black girl are especially irritating br br <UNK> lee on the side of good are the two <UNK> heroes he being the brother of the dee wallace character from the first film and she a colleague of hers and a <UNK> <UNK> type band of <UNK> still they generally manage to effortlessly overcome <UNK> rather dumb werewolves notable among them is a knife throwing dwarf who gets a particularly nasty but at the same time side splitting demise he's later <UNK> under <UNK> control in order to lure lee by making childish <UNK> at him all through the village streets into a trap the latter scene has to be a career <UNK> for the distinguished and <UNK> actor ¬ñ well either this or the early sequence in a <UNK> where lee is made to don a pair of ultra cool <UNK> so as to appear <UNK> among the <UNK> youngsters br br in the end if i were forced to mention elements in this which weren't entirely <UNK> i guess i could say that the <UNK> set in which the heroine is to be sacrificed is interesting or that the hybrid werewolf bat creature <UNK> pet who likes to <UNK> the body of its victims is just too weird to be <UNK>
<START> i think this would have been a much better film if the <UNK> had been portrayed in a more believable light my family is from the <UNK> region of <UNK> and i live in <UNK> texas about 20 miles from lake charles i have never heard the people i grew up around talk like these folks did the <UNK> were portrayed as backwards <UNK> most of the <UNK> i know are well educated proud people and don't sound <UNK> at all when they talk the way these people did all in all it was an ok movie with great scenery and music i understand that the writers were from lake charles and have knowledge of the area but for the love of all things <UNK> please have the actors study the language live amongst the people you are portraying and get an all around understanding of how they are before you go trying to act like them in my opinion when the actors make you believe they are that person it's a much more enjoyable movie
<START> it definitely fits the time period as the <UNK> allies were playing espionage games throughout most of north africa the rest of the world it's not the best of films but certainly not the worst of the budget films as described previously from the <UNK> war classics br br <UNK> <UNK> kid <UNK> was actually very good in one of his first feature films i really enjoyed the performance of harry <UNK> credited as <UNK> why he never got any bigger roles is beyond me he played the perfect buddy partner role and saved the movie imho br br as said this film was part of a budget package from <UNK> mart entitled war classics eight movies for eight bucks which included other never heard from films that has some decent stars trying to pay the bills br br this script is well not so hot the editing cinematography is worse if you can by pass all of that and want to see the future <UNK> kid a great sidekick that sadly never <UNK> his true potential definitely pick it up otherwise there's other ww2 films to watch br br <UNK>
<START> this was a disappointing film for me it came to me via a <UNK> set entitled classic film noir which was a gift from someone who knows i typically enjoy films done in that style i insist that noir is a style not a genre i do not think it is a noir film at all there seems to be a tendency these days to label and market every black and white b movie made from <UNK> to 1955 as noir and the label does not always fit there is a <UNK> male protagonist ed <UNK> lee j <UNK> and most of the film's action takes place <UNK> those are just about the only noir elements that i could see there is no <UNK> paranoia or any real reason why one should sympathize with ed <UNK> jane <UNK> was <UNK> and unconvincing as a femme fatale i do not want to spoil this film for potential viewers however i would be interested in hearing what other <UNK> of film noir have to say about it
<START> i agree with most of the columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format columbo is a unique cop with <UNK> police methods this movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past and that is the disturbing point because columbo is no ordinary detective br br there are two parts in this film that left me intriguing first i can't figure out the title of this movie it is misleading maybe a better title would've been the <UNK> bride or something similar second columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason to the viewers at least why he does it br br i don't feel betrayed just disappointed i'm glad peter falk went back to the usual columbo br br
<START> i love all of the movies by michael <UNK> jr and michael <UNK> <UNK> casting of <UNK> <UNK> as clark davis could not of been any better <UNK> <UNK> has the ways to pull off this character br br this movie kept me <UNK> from start to finish br br the death of <UNK> <UNK> baby girl with the timing of <UNK> visit was only gods timing how they dealt with the death and how clark helped them do so was that of a fathers love br br although there are 3 movies before this one love comes <UNK> loves enduring promise loves long journey i feel you can see this movie and understand it easily yet leave and want to see the previous 3 movies due to the history all the characters have behind them br br michael <UNK> jr is an excellent director br br i look forward to many more movies from him in the future
<START> she has been <UNK> from 13 to 30 with magic dust involved courtesy the 13 year old matt but nothing is made of that except as an unexplained device new york city especially central park but also every other slice of the place <UNK> into the movie seems hope filled and easily <UNK> and save for lucy there's no villain in <UNK> adult life and even lucy is not cast as monstrous only as a nasty 13 year old grown 17 years more <UNK> chris the one time boy object of <UNK> yearning is now a <UNK> cab driver and you have seen enough films to know that matt will play a major role in <UNK> future you don't know quite what might <UNK> this before it is finally achieved though i'm here to <UNK> in your ear so to speak that the device is not unique in fact not only is this a variation on the theme of tom <UNK> big though nowhere near as fine it is also a strictly by the book version of this <UNK> of the cinderella story
<START> i shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is <UNK> bad that has been done in great detail already many times over the <UNK> started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide boy gangster by numbers bore and very quickly <UNK> into an utter <UNK> anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves it is now 7 or 8 years since i watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film i have ever seen br br i am only making these comments and indeed the only reason i went to see the film is because of the amusing fact that my brother eddie appeared in it as the second <UNK> in the pub scene it was his hands that thrust a <UNK> lighter towards rhys <UNK> face in the bar in <UNK> it was actually filmed at the former <UNK> holiday camp at barry island my brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever he had recently joined an <UNK> agency and this was his first part having seen the film it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever br br i remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema and this was just a couple of days after it had been released i have never heard of an other film that was so <UNK> and disappeared so fast and rightly so in case you were thinking of renting this film on dvd i would advise you instead to put your two pound <UNK> in a fire until they are red hot then jam them into your eye <UNK> this will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film
<START> i couldn't wait to get my hands on this one when i read about fred astaire <UNK> up with george burns <UNK> allen in a movie with a script by p g <UNK> and music by the <UNK> it is definitely worth seeing but lacks the cohesive quality of the fred ginger movies br br the story would probably be better to read in a <UNK> book where the humor comes across better some of the acting is downright painful to watch notably the young boy and the damsel br br but the <UNK> dance is worth more than most movies i never knew that <UNK> allen could dance but boy does she in this movie have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning <UNK> in a <UNK> imagine <UNK> on one in high heels she keeps up wonderfully with astaire and adds greatly to the overall quality of the picture br br several nice songs particularly fun are nice work if you can get it and stiff upper lip br br recommended for fans of astaire burns allen i had to go back and re watch the <UNK> dance as soon as the credits rolled
<START> after watching this on the mst3k episode i have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from it seems to combine elements of <UNK> run <UNK> <UNK> final sacrifice and at least several others at one point i was really expecting <UNK> <UNK> to call lee <UNK> <UNK> br br i wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot like the fact that even though gas is <UNK> there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations and the stations are located close enough together to keep an <UNK> race car going all the way across the country
<START> here's another film that doesn't really need much of a recommendation it's a classic comedy very funny and entertaining and which of course ultimately inspired a successful television series which many would say was even better i enjoy both personally br br for some it's hard to warm up to jack lemmon and walter matthau as felix <UNK> and oscar madison when they were were <UNK> on the tv show starring tony randall and jack <UNK> or perhaps vice versa but what we've got there in both cases are four good actors who in real life seemed so much like their film counterparts that they managed to make these characterizations their own it's neil simon's humorous material that's key and where the laughs really <UNK> from br br for those who have somehow never heard of the odd couple it's the story of a neurotic and <UNK> neat freak lemmon who is thrown out of a 12 year marriage by his long suffering wife and takes up <UNK> in the manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy matthau <UNK> these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some hugely funny <UNK>
<START> this interesting feature has a very fine story line rather colorful characters and a very steady pace it also <UNK> a plot device from <UNK> the wild wind and since cecil b <UNK> directed that and his son in law <UNK> quinn directed this film from his <UNK> that can hardly be a coincidence it works in both cases i must report the unusual set up tells the viewer that <UNK> an island ruled by jean <UNK> is built upon <UNK> but during the war of <UNK> and before he has always <UNK> from bothering united <UNK> <UNK> now general andrew jackson has been charged with defending nearby new orleans with only 12 000 men against 60 000 british <UNK> <UNK> and 60 ships <UNK> men want him to side with the stronger force he wants freedom and <UNK> for his men before <UNK> such a <UNK> landing spot to the u s forces there are other factors at work in the story line pirate bonnie brown and her father want to attack u s ships and do so in <UNK> of <UNK> orders leaving a boy alive without knowing they have missed an <UNK> when his <UNK> finally comes out jackson cannot grant what <UNK> asks but <UNK> supports him anyway and in the fog the pirates and jackson <UNK> the british and he <UNK> away to whatever destiny <UNK> a man who had genius and <UNK> but not fortune the cast of this colorful and physically lovely film are skilled indeed <UNK> <UNK> has one of his best roles as the pirate king <UNK> stevens is beautiful as the girl he loves charles boyer has many good lines as his <UNK> powerful <UNK> greene is a rival e g marshall the <UNK> and claire bloom is charismatic as bonnie brown others in the cast include ted de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> george <UNK> henry <UNK> as jackson's <UNK> bruce gordon <UNK> stevens robert f simon henry brandon <UNK> <UNK> and leslie <UNK> among others the music by elmer <UNK> is very memorable and the 1938 script remade here had only to be <UNK> a bit the shiny cinematography was the work of veteran loyal <UNK> the set decoration was <UNK> by albert <UNK> hal <UNK> and walter tyler with set decoration by sam <UNK> and roy <UNK> and costumes by edith head john <UNK> and ralph <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> did the elaborate <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the difficult makeup the film contains quite a bit of good adventure level dialogue and a very strong climactic battle scene charlton heston as as andrew jackson prepared to play the part of an elder general and then discovered the man was young at the time of the battle but he is often effective grey haired or not especially in his <UNK> with henry <UNK> as mr <UNK> this is an exciting and well <UNK> entertainment which looks exactly as if c b demille had completed his production it is a beautiful and nearly a very fine motion picture
<START> ah a kelly sinatra sailor suit musical so familiar right yes but this isn't the one you usually hear about on the town's that a way but if you stick around you might learn something okay probably not anyway anchors aweigh tells the story of two sailors on a three or four day leave joe is the sea wolf and clarence the <UNK> type begs joe to get him a dame now after they're picked up by the <UNK> they get little donald home that's where they meet <UNK> that <UNK> that <UNK> just kidding clarence falls in love with her at least he thinks he does is he right or is he a moron or is he just misguided by society find out all this and more when you watch <UNK> <UNK> anchors aweigh br br p s if you want to see kathryn grayson be anything but <UNK> sweet try kiss me kate 1953
<START> <UNK> films always have been commercial films which suited the 90's from <UNK> <UNK> br br his last few films <UNK> were watchable family was crap br br this film is a decent film but could be better br br the problem lies in there is lot of old fashioned clich√©s thrown in and many scenes come out too <UNK> and lengthy br br ajay <UNK> character is shown very well but his character gets heroic which could be subtle br br the lengthy flashback could be avoided as <UNK> are simply long drawn br br even the street play in the second half look too simplistic and hardly a solution though the message is well brought out br br direction by <UNK> is decent though it could be better music is okay br br ajay <UNK> looks the part very well and is at ease playing his part mostly though at times he does look ill at ease in light scenes he excels in <UNK> <UNK> excels in the scene front of media <UNK> has a not proper defined role and too <UNK> yet he excels in his part <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the old age villain the rest are okay
<START> i've been working my way through a collection of lugosi films recently and having just been blown away a couple of days ago by the combination of lugosi and boris karloff in the black cat i was really looking forward to seeing their collaboration in the <UNK> alas it just didn't work for me and by the end of the film i was quite disappointed br br for the first three quarters of this movie or so i thought the story lacked any real suspense lugosi was doing a pretty good job of holding things together as the somewhat mad dr <UNK> some sort of <UNK> genius who falls in love with a young woman irene <UNK> he treats after a car accident but who can't have her partly because she's already engaged and partly because her father samuel s <UNK> <UNK> to deal with that situation he <UNK> the aid of <UNK> <UNK> boris karloff a horribly ugly man who wants <UNK> to make him look more acceptable aside from <UNK> performance though i found little to hold my interest then suddenly in the last fifteen or twenty minutes the movie shifts around completely suddenly it becomes quite suspenseful but i thought <UNK> performance fell apart largely because the movie tried to shift him from mad to insane and there's a difference he plays the mad role very well controlled and in control but evil insane is a more out of control evil and i didn't think lugosi pulled that off well at one point he offers some <UNK> laughter which just comes across as fake in the meantime karloff was a huge disappointment he never grabbed me at all as an aside it must have <UNK> on lugosi that in movies in which they co star karloff gets the top billing even though in the <UNK> it's clearly lugosi who is the lead actor this surely gives a hint as to how universal <UNK> their two great horror stars inexplicably i would add because i've always thought of lugosi as the better actor of the two br br in any event there's no real connection here to edgar allen <UNK> story the <UNK> except that <UNK> is a poe fanatic who tries to recreate some of the torture techniques from <UNK> stories overall a disappointment 4 10
<START> as a horse lover one can only appreciate this movie there are few movies that show <UNK> as this one does i would love to know if brian does his own riding in the film would also like to know if he enjoys horses brian has been in a lot of movies where he has ridden where did he learn to ride the only part that is hard for me to take is that the riding scenes are always full <UNK> like a horse can run forever at full steam the camera work is first rate and captures the horses in a way that shows how dangerous things can be on top of a horse it would be very interesting to know how they went about casting this movie to find all of the very good <UNK> riders
<START> this movie is horrendous decent fight scenes or not the acting is really bad like you can tell they're reading their lines from a card with painful line delivery by everyone in the cast think watching a high school play and cringing at the obvious lack of <UNK> in the actor's interactions weird pauses between different character's lines combined with <UNK> line delivery by others if the movie were all action this might be forgivable but a lot of the movie includes plot set up and family guy style <UNK> cut <UNK> oh wow are they badly done i'm assuming they were attempting to be funny with these but it again came off as a bunch of high <UNK> college entry students <UNK> off for the afternoon trying to set up a funny youtube clip br br now to the fight scenes they're not too bad considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film nothing great either certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated nothing like drunken master the fights have an overly staged feel with lots of cuts to different angles with blatantly different positions by those involved br br in sum the only reason to watch this movie is if you were one of the guy's friends involved with this very very cheap production which guy you may ask oh the same guy who wrote directed produced and <UNK> in this middle school masterpiece
<START> road to <UNK> a movie <UNK> overlooked at that year oscars is the second work of sam <UNK> and in my opinion his best work a director who three years before won oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial american beauty this is a terrific movie and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad br br it's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from <UNK> appearance during difficult times of depression when the michael sullivan a father of two children played by great tom hanks i'm not his admirer but ought to say that is a hit man for local mafia boss played by paul newman his <UNK> son a thirteen years boy michael sullivan jr perfectly played by young tyler <UNK> after years of <UNK> ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live <UNK> by his curiosity and his <UNK> to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder committed by john rooney son of his father boss such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever the atmosphere of the period all the backgrounds and <UNK> are perfectly created editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written but the main line of the movie the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father son relations in bad times they are shown so deeply strong and believable tom hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb finally worth to mention a very nice score by paul newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful but one more time sad masterpiece i believe road to <UNK> belongs to greatest achievements of film making of this decade and undoubtedly one of the best films of the year br br my grade 10 out of 10
<START> a painfully <UNK> <UNK> and predictable drama my twenty fifth sidney lumet film garbo talks gets <UNK> <UNK> on the low quality end of my quest br br the film documents a <UNK> young working man named gilbert ron silver who is son to <UNK> <UNK> anne <UNK> eccentric <UNK> and above all an obsessive fan of greta garbo when <UNK> becomes <UNK> with a brain <UNK> her son decides to go on an obsessive quest of his own track down greta garbo and bring her to his mother br br anne <UNK> is in full on chew the scenery <UNK> <UNK> mode here that kind of <UNK> ol' gal that film loves where she mouths off to people and stands up for her ideals and ends up in jail all the time she stands outside of the film as an obvious artificial <UNK> and every scene with her is <UNK> <UNK> lame every note striking false the rest of the characters are equally as one dimensional but tremendously less interesting ron silver is flat as can be and his attempted love triangle is as <UNK> as anything else in the film he is dating <UNK> lisa <UNK> carrie fisher but becomes smitten with oddball co worker jane <UNK> catherine <UNK> and i called every scene three scenes before they happen br br that's the other problem one dimensional characters can survive if they are <UNK> in an intriguing and captivating story but there's simply nothing here the film's pace is <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> material that <UNK> absolutely nothing and when the film does begin to follow a linear plot it's both plodding and uninteresting there are plenty of guest stars so to speak including harvey <UNK> as a gay new <UNK> imagine that in yet another highly <UNK> scene br br late in the film it attempts to make a halfway decent statement on the nature of <UNK> and its role in our lives but by that time none of the characters exist as real people and the film had bored me into <UNK> so it functions as a case of far too little far too late the film is my twenty fifth lumet directed film making him easily my most viewed director but outside of a couple <UNK> misses a stranger among us anyone he hasn't <UNK> the painfully uninteresting depths of garbo talks br br grade 4 5 10 c c 21 of 24 of 1984 23 of 25 lumet films
<START> this movie surprised me some things were <UNK> and some technological elements reminded me of the movie enemy of the state starring will smith but for the most part very entertaining good mix with jamie foxx and comedian mike <UNK> and the 2 wannabe thugs <UNK> and <UNK> providing some comic relief this is a movie you can watch over again say some <UNK> night when nothing else is on i gave it a 9 for entertainment value
<START> i'm not a huge freddy krueger fan but that doesn't mean that i don't like robert englund and his other nightmare on elm street movies i think that robert is a very good actor nobody plays a better freddy krueger than he does but no offense robert this movie sucked the acting is terrible the plot is really weak and freddy krueger is the only part of the cast that's even worth watching sometimes sequels can be better than the first such as the friday the 13th franchise i thought the remake was the best in the series but this isn't one of those movies the original was good the 2nd in my opinion was better the 3rd was okay but i <UNK> t seen the others whatever you do don t make the same mistake i did by watching this piece of crap
<START> i saw this bomb when it hit theaters i laughed the whole time why because the stupidity of it seemed to have made me go insane i look back on it and realize there was not one funny thing in the whole movie at <UNK> nothing intentional it is awfully funny that <UNK> <UNK> chew a piece of <UNK> and become a gigantic <UNK> demon yet her <UNK> <UNK> little dress is perfectly intact despite the fact that she is now hundreds of times larger than she was when she first put it on or the kind of movie in which a man can be shocked with a <UNK> and only fall <UNK> and return to <UNK> without any medical attention and don't let me get started on the ridiculous fate of the villain that they decided they needed to create conflict uh huh br br to the person complaining about disney only <UNK> kids the raunchy parts of this film seems to <UNK> that statement do we really need <UNK> hannah <UNK> jeff bridges of having kinky video tapes you do if you're disney and you're out of ideas for making the movie appeal to the above 8 crowd without writing a more intelligent script i am thoroughly convinced that disney pays off the ratings board so it's movies can get away with murder and still get family friendly ratings br br what a waste of the dvd format
<START> <UNK> house of dolls 1973 1974 or 1977 various years are given for this title is a hong kong veteran <UNK> hung <UNK> killer snakes <UNK> omen <UNK> in blood etc women in prison flick produced by the legendary shaw brothers yes even they got their hands into low exploitation <UNK> like this and <UNK> is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre even when compared to the western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the eastern films br br the story is about a japanese war camp in which the chinese women are <UNK> abused and raped by the bad japanese what else during the world war ii the girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a chinese military officer raised in japan shaw veteran lo <UNK> is actually now an undercover agent among the other japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell what follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity female kung fu some nasty torture gore sleaze and extremely offensive anti japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that doesn't even try to be more than it is br br there are hardly any interesting elements in <UNK> house of dolls the occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its <UNK> and beautiful nature but that's about it in the merits department the fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other the violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds misogynistic torture scenes for example one poor girl is <UNK> on the floor filled with broken glass etc and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it of course it is stupid to talk about moral when writing about this kind of film but still there are elements i won't accept to be found from any film br br the film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure for example the gold box filled with heavy gold seems <UNK> light as the weak and suffered girls don't seem to have any problems <UNK> and moving it not to speak of throwing it also those numerous skin fight scenes make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema i have seen the same director's killer snakes 1973 which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society also it is a must for those who fear snakes br br <UNK> house of dolls has suffered some censorship too which isn't a surprise considered the subject matter the uncut version dubbed into a non english language released in europe at least in france italy and switzerland runs <UNK> pal minutes while the cut english dubbed print released in holland <UNK> and <UNK> runs only <UNK> minutes in pal from what i've heard the cut scenes are not only violence or other graphic stuff but also dialogue and plot development and the like br br <UNK> house of dolls is garbage cinema in its most trashy form and definitely something i wouldn't have liked to see from the shaw brothers or hong kong in general some of the italian exploitation films of the same subject matter are much more interesting and noteworthy than this quite ridiculous <UNK> and worthless piece of cinema exploitation 2 10
<START> who what where when why the acting was terrible very robotic <UNK> i have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles the screenplay was very <UNK> by the end of this film the story line was tied up and <UNK> claude <UNK> should be tied up too so that he never attempts to write direct another film
<START> legend of zu br br i remember well tsui <UNK> original zu warriors made 18 years earlier over one christmas on a rare week when channel 4 in the uk showed a week of hong kong movies zu warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable that it's been <UNK> into the memory of the now grown up <UNK> br br in fact i think the original zu warriors is one of the earliest films i saw as a kid that i can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from and the memories of seeing <UNK> <UNK> sammo hung and others in their classic prime br br so when i saw this remake of zu warriors there was a feeling of <UNK> could it beat the dreamy childhood memories i had of the original or will it follow the road of other remakes and die a death more horrible than the baddies and their broken <UNK> you find in those kung fu movies br br well the answer is i can't say but that was because this isn't really a remake the stories and styles are almost completely different br br the legend of zu tells of the story of king sky a lone warrior whose master dawn declares her love for him but her life is taken from her by a monster called insomnia two hundred years later insomnia returns dawn is <UNK> as <UNK> and insomnia has returned to destroy zu meanwhile white <UNK> and red try with the help of king sky to stop insomnia br br the plot isn't one full of twists and turns but had enough detail in it to keep me interested but i can see this film as one you either love or you hate the film is very much about the special effects with the majority of it involving several computer generated <UNK> much like the storm riders and a man called hero but unlike the other two this film was one which didn't <UNK> the graphics and the whole thing was <UNK> nothing appears rushed unlike hero the backgrounds were <UNK> to the acting and not at all <UNK> the scenes br br the story also involves plenty of characters and the <UNK> of so many individuals does make the film intriguing it was possibly on the verge of <UNK> many <UNK> but generally each character had its part in the story but some of the roles appear to be <UNK> <UNK> in my opinion and i somehow am left to slightly question the necessity of this br br <UNK> <UNK> and louis <UNK> play very central roles in the film but i couldn't say this film showed their best performances <UNK> cheung appears to at least have <UNK> in her acting but it is still quite raw kelly lin was the new revelation for me despite her very short role i have <UNK> and admit to <UNK> br br overall i have to say did enjoy this film as much as i enjoyed the <UNK> given that both movies are made by the legendary tsui <UNK> the two films together are part of a <UNK> showing how film making in hong kong has changed over two decades and one beauty of that is the fact that you can't really compare the two films at all as much as <UNK> are <UNK> and <UNK> are <UNK> br br ultimately both are thoroughly enjoyable films in their own right and i'm going back to <UNK> by watching the original again br br two to watch but not compare
<START> this movie was one of the worst i've ever seen pure drivel how anyone could develop a connection with the heroine or have empathy for her is beyond me i felt i was watching a case history of a <UNK> individual with borderline personality disorder just terrible br br in its most generous light this can be seen as an attempt at producing and art film except i could not for the life of me find any art in it at all br br if this woman had lived in <UNK> world she would have been <UNK> off to a mental institution and given a couple of days treatment with anti psychotic <UNK> that or simply allowed to <UNK> the streets and become a bag woman why other characters in this movie found anything redeeming in her and tried to aid her in her quest to become an actress speaks more to their <UNK> than any convincing characteristics she had that made her worth that effort
<START> okay so the introduction with its hokey offer of a free coffin to anyone who dies of fright during the film is so lame it's funny and so the first skull scene is so drawn out and un suspenseful it's funny the actual plot of the movie is somewhat decent there's at least a little bit of genuine food for thought in the behavior of the characters and the plot twist is decent as horror flicks go the acting is average not truly bad br br altogether this movie doesn't quite fall flat in the way a 1 10 movie would it's not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or even second lowest if i just read the screenplay i'd say there was potential for this to be a decent movie it's just that the horrid direction and production that ruin the movie so it's a bad movie but there are much worse ones out there
<START> although it really isn't such a terribly movie especially considering it was made directly for tv distribution it'll be very difficult to point out one aspect in <UNK> that is actually original or refreshing vampires in space isn't exactly a new formula and even after so many movies dealing with these monsters in this particular setting still no one seems to realize it's an incredibly stupid premise that can't possibly result in a halfway decent horror movie <UNK> even goes one step further and shamelessly <UNK> every imaginable motion picture that either revolves on vampires and <UNK> <UNK> the plot and characters are mainly stolen directly from john carpenter's ghosts of mars and james <UNK> aliens as a crew of futuristic vampire hunters are <UNK> through space and regularly holding to eliminate a mutated species that <UNK> named themselves after notorious horror icons like the <UNK> and the <UNK> the good guys are a bunch of pathetic stereotypes constantly dealing with clich√©d issues and endlessly arguing about dreadfully <UNK> matters captain <UNK> is the <UNK> rookie <UNK> really have to prove his <UNK> <UNK> now after being more or less responsible for the death of the previous and far more loved captain <UNK> the other annoying characters include a typical cowboy style and trigger happy macho pilot a tough female warrior with more balls than any of the males on board she's of asian descent like the girl in aliens was latino and the <UNK> most valuable secret weapon a blade girl <UNK> is a beautiful and deadly vampire who chose the side of humans she can spot enemies when they're still light years away and she can also do <UNK> sexy things with someone's wet dreams they eventually all learn to work as a team when forced to face the ultimate vampire <UNK> michael <UNK> in yet another <UNK> role <UNK> is an <UNK> stupid film but it manages to entertain as long as it features gory killings <UNK> dialogs and <UNK> make up effects it only gets <UNK> boring when the frustrated soldiers blame the captain for the <UNK> time and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this film is a non stop series of lame clich√©s and <UNK> ideas but at least it's watchable
<START> my husband and i bought the old school <UNK> street dvd's for our daughter and i have to say i don't let her watch the new episodes on tv because i find all of the characters annoying baby bear and telly <UNK> how annoying and useless <UNK> can someone think of for their <UNK> <UNK> give it a rest not every kid likes him once again annoying and doesn't teach my child anything mr <UNK> what a reject i think the one time i turned the <UNK> show on for her she and i were left dumber than before the show has definitely taken a wrong turn i remember the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> breaking news 1 2 2 little dolls <UNK> the magician bert and ernie <UNK> the <UNK> all the great educational skits of old school s s <UNK> street has suffered a direct hit of boredom and <UNK> since jim <UNK> passing in 1990 the show no longer has the educational funny and <UNK> skits it used to i find the new versions simply <UNK> annoying and full of useless non educational <UNK> way to go s s producers writers you have yet another <UNK> show for the parents to sit there non creative non <UNK> kids in front of so they'll get out of their hair per producers writers i suggest you whip out the old muppets and start <UNK> similar content to that of the first <UNK> <UNK> lord knows i sure don't want my child talking like baby bear or <UNK>
<START> a shirley temple short subject br br it can get mighty rough at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when the local <UNK> of <UNK> clad war babies come in for their <UNK> milk break br br this primitive little film a spoof of military movies provides a few chuckles but little else tiny <UNK> talking tough can begin to <UNK> in a short time shirley temple playing a <UNK> hip swinging french miss hasn't much to do in this pre celebrity performance highlight the real signs of <UNK> temper when a few of the <UNK> unexpectedly get well truly <UNK> with milk br br often overlooked or neglected today the one and two reel short subjects were useful to the studios as important training grounds for new or <UNK> talents both in front behind the camera the dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film something akin to writing a <UNK> short story rather than a novel <UNK> to produce in terms of both budget schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material short subjects were the perfect <UNK> to the <UNK> feature films
<START> i'd never seen an independent movie and i was really impressed by the writing acting and cinematography of <UNK> closet br br the emotions were very real and intense showing through a child's eyes the harsh impact of divorce br br a definite see br br i'd never seen an independent movie and i was really impressed by the writing acting and cinematography of <UNK> closet br br the emotions were very real and intense showing through a child's eyes the harsh impact of divorce br br a definite see
<START> wow i really liked this movie william h macy is great as the quiet hit man alex br br all the performances here are really good the plot is interesting and entertaining br br alex a married hit man like his father with a little son is going through a middle age crisis and wants to quit the family business so he goes to the psychiatrist for help and in this place he meets the young free will spirit sarah of whom he falls in love to one day alex doesn't know what to do when he gets a job to kill a person he knows br br i recommend you to watch it if you like mature interesting movies br br 8 stars very good
<START> spanish horror icon paul naschy stars in this one of his weakest werewolf films but bear with me for a moment most people will be familiar with it under its most common television title the fury of the wolf man and there have been many home video versions of it over the years if you want to be serious about giving it a fair shot though the most <UNK> edition i've seen of it goes by the title the wolf man never sleeps and it's an <UNK> and complete european version which <UNK> a couple of disturbing scenes and contains the original nude shots which are missing from <UNK> print it is also <UNK> br br naschy plays <UNK> <UNK> returning home from a trip to <UNK> only to find out that he's <UNK> a werewolf curse and that his wife has been having an affair he takes care of her and her lover while in animal form but then becomes a guinea pig for a sexy woman doctor and her female assistant apparently the doc attempts to tame the werewolf and there is a very strange <UNK> <UNK> love scene between her and the hairy and <UNK> <UNK> who is under her <UNK> at least in the original version ultimately we get two werewolves for the price of one as <UNK> battles a she wolf br br the biggest problem with the movie is that the director according to <UNK> claims was often drunk and the results are indeed rather incoherent when watching the wolf man never sleeps copy it's not quite as difficult to make out what's going on though the editing remains atrocious in spots worst of all is occasional non matching footage of <UNK> <UNK> werewolf <UNK> straight from another previous film la marc del <UNK> <UNK> aka <UNK> bloody terror and mixed into this one without any sensible reason the <UNK> clothing changes from black shirt to white and back again as does his demeanor one moment the wolf is walking around <UNK> in a hypnotic <UNK> from fury next he is <UNK> and running around <UNK> from bloody terror really bizarre
<START> <UNK> is a rare little movie it is simple and <UNK> and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy the story is simple and the theme of old and new <UNK> is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes this theme is the essence of the movie but it would have fallen flat if it wasn't for the magnificent characters and the actors portraying them br br the aging <UNK> master liu is a <UNK> of <UNK> pre <UNK> days he runs a bath house in an old <UNK> every single scene set in the bath house is a source of <UNK> for us <UNK> out unhappy people not even hardened <UNK> can find any flaws in this wonderful setting br br master <UNK> mentally handicapped son er <UNK> is the second truly powerful character in the movie coupled with his modern life brother the interactions between these three people and the various <UNK> to the bath house are amazingly detailed and heart felt with some scenes <UNK> so much emotion it's beyond almost everything seen in movies br br with its regime critical message this movie was not only <UNK> but also given <UNK> small coverage it could be a coincidence but when a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to find even on the internet you can't help getting suspicious br br so help free speech and the movie world buy rent copy this wonderful movie and if you happen to own the dvd if there even is one then share share share
<START> attack force has a horrendous title and can almost certainly be judged by it's awful cover because the film is horrible a <UNK> mash of plot lines a choppy mess and a horribly <UNK> pace make the film hard to watch start to finish i managed this and i'm proud as a fan of <UNK> work mostly of his old days it's painful to see him star in such tripe true <UNK> last half dozen movies or so have sucked a lot but some of them at least had some redeeming features attack force is a mess from conception to delivery this film has <UNK> many changes from an alien plot line to the current one about a highly <UNK> super drug about to be unleashed on the romanian the film has several settings none of which are romanian but all look like romania because they are in romania <UNK> the film is tacked together with little regard for whatever state the original shooting script was plot holes and loose ends are abound in the film that's for sure that's been a problem in <UNK> last few films as well but never has the result been so boring there's a whole plot line about the water supply being <UNK> with <UNK> that's the drugs cool name that is never resolved br br of course in recent years the <UNK> haven't been the main draw in the seagal <UNK> so there was a big <UNK> on the other <UNK> especially the action before i regard the action though all the other <UNK> are poor the direction is poor or perhaps better put made to look poor who knows how director michael <UNK> originally intended this film between him finishing his job the re shoots by stunt man tom <UNK> and the editing a coherent auteur vision is completely lost the best way to describe the film is that it's just all over the shop the cinematography is dull nearly inducing sleep while the <UNK> score sounding like it was produced on the <UNK> of cheap <UNK> does nothing to <UNK> matters the cast too are poor unable to salvage anything here seagal looks bored beyond recognition and is dubbed through much of the picture clearly when plot points are being changed he looks tired and overweight and <UNK> unlike he's looked in previous pictures too remarkable as the aforementioned have been key complaints in <UNK> recent pictures the only <UNK> cast member is adam <UNK> as one of the villains doing a slimy brit routine he seems to be a <UNK> to the alien plot line because he's playing it <UNK> he seems like a cross between a body <UNK> and a vampire <UNK> to the lead villain played by some hot chick who appears on occasion seemingly waiting for her <UNK> dracula br br finally the action well it's poor poorly conceived poorly shot there's not much either and there's even less featuring seagal <UNK> doesn't really bring out the stunt double here because there's so little to do there's even a lengthy repetitive and boring action scene on the hour mark that inter cuts occasionally with little flashes of <UNK> stand in because clearly seagal wasn't there while the scene was being shot and they wanted to have him feature in the action scene seagal eventually appears in person to shoot two guys in the head seagal has a producers credit here and a script credit but from what i understand the film has been altered behind his back to the current state it's in seagal will apparently not be working with these people again or with <UNK> <UNK> who continue to deliver <UNK> sub <UNK> image that's saying something material br br overall this is one to avoid if you are not a seagal fan seagal fans can also be safe in the knowledge that the big man probably won't want to do anything this bad again unfortunately his next film which has already been shot with the same people promises to be even worse than this
<START> this film just goes to prove that not every film made during the glory days of hollywood is worth seeing just because you've got an excellent ensemble cast doesn't mean that this can overcome a script that was probably written by a <UNK> think about it the film featured richard widmark lauren bacall charles boyer gloria graham <UNK> <UNK> and paul stewart and yet it still was a bad film the basic premise of the film isn't bad a private psychiatric hospital where the staff are more screwed up than the patients also the subplot involving the <UNK> husband and wife widmark and graham had a lot of promise however the script was handled with all the <UNK> and <UNK> of a drunk buffalo with <UNK> and way over the top scenes again and again in the film in fact it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of general hospital subtle this film ain't realistic this film ain't br br while most of the reason this film <UNK> was the awful script but i also blame the producers as well for <UNK> and <UNK> come veteran actors for example paul stewart may not be a household name but this character actor had exceptional talent especially when playing gangsters in film noir movies yet here stewart is cast as a very <UNK> psychiatrist with some bizarre european accent it just didn't work since this was well outside his acting range and his character was totally undeveloped and one dimensional also charles boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the <UNK> of america just seemed bizarre br br overall this is a rather awful film it is very watchable in a train wreck sort of way but it certainly isn't very pretty my wife and i disliked much of the movie but also felt it could have been very good had the writing been competent br br ps in a case of art imitating life oscar <UNK> played one of the patients in real life the brilliant <UNK> spent much of his life in and out of mental <UNK>
<START> the arrival of an world famous conductor sets of unexpected events and feelings in the small village some people are threatened by the way he handles the church choir and how people in it gradually change this movie is heartwarming and makes you leave the cinema with both a smile on your lips and tears in your eyes <UNK> about bringing out the best in people and kay <UNK> has written an excellent script based on the ideas he has become so famous for the actors are outstanding michael <UNK> we know before but <UNK> <UNK> was an new and charming <UNK> to me she has a most vivid face that leaves no one <UNK> per <UNK> does his part as <UNK> husband almost too well he is awful too see one only wish the at he would be casted to play a nice guy one day so we can see if he masters that character as well br br this is a movie that will not leave you <UNK> if you haven't already seen it do it today
<START> this is a very good under rated action drama and slightly historical movie br br the basic story concerns rob <UNK> <UNK> of 1000 pounds its <UNK> and the problems it causes for his family and <UNK> his <UNK> br br cunningham tim roth is an amazing villain and character in this story brutally cold and if you watch his face he seems to be able to turn his eyes off and look completely evil br br rob roy liam neeson is excellent too but i think the writers used the word honour 1 too many times br br the rest of the cast is strong and the whole movie is very well acted and filmed br br the action is exciting and the sword play very realistic but not too gory the story is good and you really want rob to win br br all in all just shy of a classic
<START> what of domino did i hate over everything and i mean everything else perhaps it was the overall <UNK> of being a bounty hunter maybe it was the <UNK> <UNK> as an involving and interesting study of a hard <UNK> female lead character maybe it was the mere look of the film with its bizarre yellow glow and distorted blue <UNK> or the manner in which it takes an actress like lucy <UNK> who deserves a lot better than this junk and has her sit there in the one spot in the room the light cannot directly hit with the same dumb look on her face maybe it's the editing that horrid rapid fire editing and the manner in which lines of dialogue echo as they're <UNK> by people like <UNK> <UNK> who if you buy as a bounty hunter then you'll probably be able to kid yourself into believing the world will end in <UNK> br br nobody comes away from domino with any sort credibility absolutely nobody at all it is a painful and misguided experience taking inspiration from things like natural born killers and letting loose ideas to an audience not even there for them the principal question is <UNK> domino supposed to be some kind of comedy ' what with its hilariously bad lead <UNK> certain lines that desperately want us to think she's coming across as <UNK> but really she resembles more an arrogant fifteen year old girl on her first day at public school attempting to impress her peers there are things you genuinely don't know how to react to whether they're supposed to be funny or not if it is supposed to be a comedy that begs the next question <UNK> the life of a bounty hunter really the sort worth <UNK> for laughs ' i don't think so br br the film opens with the title card <UNK> on a true story sort of ' if that's supposed to be some sort of post <UNK> technique that <UNK> director tony scott to bend and manipulate the story of domino harvey for his own unique purpose then you're simply on another planet truth is in that one opening quote the film <UNK> the subject matter and the original text before completely <UNK> out and saying <UNK> <UNK> which i guess is supposed to <UNK> them to make domino older than she should be and appear on jerry springer following this we learn of <UNK> relationship with her father who died in the film when when she was ten or something here is the first use of the <UNK> <UNK> cop out as in real life she was just four but if the film had gone by <UNK> dates then her entire drive would've been born out of the death of her <UNK> br br we are then thrust into action with ed <UNK> rourke domino knightley herself and would be love interest <UNK> <UNK> during the scene an american mother is <UNK> down via <UNK> in her own <UNK> in the back end of nowhere as she <UNK> for her son's life to be <UNK> what a really misguided opening presenting its three leads as nasty people who break into trailers fire off weapons at <UNK> we don't know anything of and come close to shooting their pet dogs br br the immediate feeling is of hatred toward the three leads a feeling of <UNK> why are you doing this why is this happening ' bad <UNK> are planted and wouldn't you know it they stick the film is painful to watch excruciating even as these three <UNK> their way through the piece complete with supporting performances from actors known for playing characters in beverly hills <UNK> here is another <UNK> post <UNK> <UNK> people playing themselves and that <UNK> <UNK> joker card being played again christopher walken even pops up in a really stupid role that <UNK> of robert downey <UNK> natural born killers character br br so as the film <UNK> on and domino is cast into ed and <UNK> gang purely for her good looks i might add it appears amidst the plot to do with fake <UNK> <UNK> i <UNK> or something that <UNK> and domino may have feelings for one another the problem is as each performer is doing such a bad job in their respective character there is no chemistry and no feeling between the two the film isn't a love story so why even bother going down that road in the first place does anyone care about these two characters amidst all the fast edits and stuff blowing up if there is any <UNK> between <UNK> and domino it exists on such a small tiny <UNK> scale that you have to ask why it's even included br br so then the film feels the need to <UNK> things up narrative wise we find out the reason for the fake i <UNK> that are linked to someone else and a guy talks on a cell phone in a sound proof bubble the sound proof bubble i can believe but how does he get his phone under the water and into the bubble in the first place without it becoming <UNK> he must've <UNK> really quickly ¬ñ double the speed of the film's <UNK> edit which means something in the region of <UNK> of a second yeah sure the film's story becomes both too complicated and just plain <UNK> before <UNK> to a really dumb climax in which more stuff blows up plus there's a really <UNK> scene to do with a wall <UNK> full of new <UNK> and the film's comedy runs so dry that it has to resort to the jerry jerry <UNK> whilst people are on a popular american talk show when did we last laugh at jerry jerry when we were say seven years old i came away feeling sad and depressed at such a film's existence
<START> spoilers br br this is one bad movie seriously acting in absolutely horrible the fx are <UNK> and the plot is down right awful but hey its so bad that its fun watching the script is so bad that its enjoyable you just have to cringe and laugh at lines such as i guess thats what you call <UNK> as the women flash their breasts at the crocodile i mean come on thats funny cause its so bad it has such horrible jokes that they're funny but after a while it just becomes to much as the movie turns into crap i really started to fall asleep trust me though the plastic croc foot <UNK> on the leaves and the constant <UNK> of a <UNK> tail well keep you laughing for a long time though i have to say it had one cool part when the croc ripped that dude in half and he just hung there for a while <UNK> out what to do <UNK> <UNK> mindless movie which has to be nominated for the mst3k line
<START> stan laurel and oliver hardy had extensive separate film careers before they were eventually teamed for many of <UNK> pre stan films he was billed on screen as babe hardy and throughout his adult life hardy was known to his friends as <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> britain with laurel in a music hall act for bernard <UNK> hardy gave an interview to journalist john <UNK> in which he explained the origin of this <UNK> early in his acting career hardy got a <UNK> from a gay <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the ones on his face and said <UNK> baby ' <UNK> <UNK> started crying him <UNK> and the <UNK> stuck br br although much of <UNK> pre laurel work is very interesting notably his comedy roles in support of larry <UNK> and the chaplin <UNK> billy west his <UNK> with billy <UNK> who in a series of low budget shorts for the <UNK> comedy film company is very dire indeed hardy and <UNK> were given the screen names <UNK> and <UNK> names which are unpleasant in their own right but made worse because <UNK> although shorter than hardy isn't especially a <UNK> seen here hardy looks much as he does in his early hal roach films with laurel but without the spit <UNK> and the <UNK> little <UNK> br br <UNK> too <UNK> an absolutely typical <UNK> and <UNK> epic is <UNK> unfunny and its <UNK> is made even more <UNK> by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as <UNK> my <UNK> one of laurel and <UNK> most hilarious films <UNK> hardy is the star <UNK> in a <UNK> house run by a tall <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is the porter <UNK> receives a letter from his wealthy uncle john whose <UNK> he expects to <UNK> his uncle is coming to see him and to meet <UNK> wife and baby there's only one problem <UNK> hasn't got a wife and baby he's been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man now of course <UNK> expects <UNK> to find him a wife and baby on short notice of course the results are disastrous it would be nice if those disastrous results were funny but they aren't most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick with characters <UNK> their arguments by <UNK> each other into <UNK> br br spoilers coming <UNK> director will louis who shows no instinct for camera framing the actress who plays the <UNK> is significantly <UNK> than hardy and louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame this could be funny if done on purpose but it's merely inept at one point in this bad comedy an extremely tasteless gag is <UNK> on the horizon as <UNK> approaches a black <UNK> <UNK> they wouldn't <UNK> that low for a laugh ' i thought but they do <UNK> steals the woman's black <UNK> and tries to <UNK> this off as <UNK> <UNK> br br somehow <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> but he still hasn't got a baby with uncle john coming up the stairs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> this gag might just possibly have worked with a midget or even with a truly <UNK> sized actor such as <UNK> <UNK> but billy <UNK> is only slightly below average height <UNK> <UNK> of a baby is neither believable nor funny and uncle john would have to be a complete moron to fall for it amazingly he does br br the most notable aspect of <UNK> too <UNK> is a brief appearance apparently her only ever film appearance by <UNK> <UNK> oliver <UNK> first wife the marriage was not a happy one although <UNK> marital troubles never <UNK> the epic proportions of stan <UNK> br br only one thing in this movie impressed me there is a very brief flashback sequence with hardy <UNK> about his <UNK> romance with a bathing beauty in <UNK> there was still not yet a standard film <UNK> for conveying flashbacks the one shown here is done <UNK> and simply too bad this movie has no other merits <UNK> too <UNK> is definitely one film too many on oliver <UNK> <UNK> and i'll rate this movie just one point out of 10 laurel and hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them <UNK>
<START> <UNK> 3 primal species 1996 d jonathan <UNK> scott valentine janet <UNK> rick dean anthony peck <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> j vaughn billy <UNK> why even bother reviewing this movie another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those lethal and very fake looking <UNK> monsters running around killing people in gory ways the original was bad enough the sequel was even worse this falls somewhere in between though unrelated to either of the previous <UNK> films rating 2 out of 10 rated r for graphic violence and gore grisly images and profanity
<START> this movie truly captures the feeling of freedom and what the freedom of your own integrity is worth in the most delightful light hearted way not a serious but hilarious adventure br br the story mirrors life we don't always get what we want right away but we find out we get what we need to to understand why we didn't get what we wanted which results in us getting more than we thought we would get you will get this once you see the movie br br and this movie is truly about finding love and knowing one has found it and that it totally changed one's life br br it is one of my all time favorites not easy to find but worth the hunt i guarantee you will watch it more than once

<START> tarzan and jane are living happily in the jungle some men come looking for <UNK> and to take jane back to civilization but jane loves tarzan and refuses to leave one of the men falls in love with jane and is determined to take her back even if that means killing tarzan br br this is a <UNK> a sequel that's better than the original tarzan the ape man of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged this one has much better effects and is a lot more adult there is tons of blatant racism a black man is shot to death point blank and no one really cares but this was 1934 there's also plenty of blood gore and violence for a 1934 movie and uncut <UNK> have jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude there's also obvious sexual content and tarzan and jane are wearing next to nothing and it's implied they sleep together and have sex without being married this wouldn't bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme br br that aside the movie is well directed very fast moving and full of adventure and excitement seeing <UNK> in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and jane's outfit is pretty revealing too i still think maureen <UNK> is bad as jane but <UNK> is perfect as tarzan everybody else is ok br br this is easily the best <UNK> o'hara tarzan out there well worth seeing but not for kids
<START> casting unknown michelle rodriguez as diana was a stroke of genius she's perfect her acting <UNK> actually works in her favor we've never seen her before so it really feels like her story she also brings across genuine <UNK> this works against her though because we never doubt her you never have to cheer for her to win because she never goes up against any fighter we don't think she can beat so as a boxing movie it fails br br then again this isn't really a boxing movie how do you make a movie about a girl who wants to be a boxer that isn't a boxing movie you don't but <UNK> <UNK> has anyway like many indie films <UNK> defies <UNK> or genre and stands on its own as <UNK> that could darn near happen in real life br br diana is doing poorly in school she beats up people she doesn't like all the other girls in her school for example she doesn't fit in her father is forcing her kid brother tiny to learn to box so he can defend himself when things get tough he gives tiny money for his boxing sessions and gives diana nothing as if she has no need to defend herself nor anything worthwhile to make of her life tiny wants to go to art school <UNK> <UNK> so he gives up his boxing <UNK> to diana who actually wants to box things get complicated when diana falls for another boxer adrian <UNK> douglas who's looking to turn pro from there the story winds down toward the inevitable the two meet in the amateur title fight br br what left me cold was that i never found any of this all that interesting it's all just a bit too believable kids with tough lives growing up in rough urban areas fall back on sports a lot of professional <UNK> have <UNK> from these circumstances the mental and physical <UNK> this upbringing requires lends itself to a game like boxing where anger is your friend so this time it's a girl big deal br br or there's another position to take finally a boxing movie about a girl women's boxing has been around a long time the brutality we usually see in boxing films is replaced here by discussions of people's their lives and their feelings the whole fighting thing is used as a platform from which to paint a larger picture respect <UNK> <UNK> self discovery br br i recommend <UNK> because it has a good spirit and is an example of some great work by a first time director the dialogue never rises above soap opera quality but the story itself actually changed my view on some things yes the world now seems like a better place a film did that br br grade b
<START> the <UNK> could leave you a little sore in the <UNK> definitely not one of <UNK> best movies don't get me wrong with any john wayne move there is always some good spots and this one has it's fair share but over all the picture moves slow and just doesn't live up to the aspirations it could have been bruce dern again does an outstanding job as the villain <UNK> lee brown is another bright spot in the movie the kids in the movie were average but could have been cast better this would be a good movie for the eight to fifteen year old movie goers br br this would be a good family move to watch with your children just be aware there is a couple of scenes that you may want to take a look at before you let the young ones see it but most kids that i know who have seen the movie like it maybe it's because they get to see kids their age do all the grown up work
<START> <UNK> i really enjoy movies like chances are but i wasn't quite satisfied with this one for a few reasons the first half was pretty well done overall with alex <UNK> dying and being <UNK> in a new body played by robert downey jr he meets up with his wife <UNK> shepherd and friend ryan <UNK> and his daughter who is now grown up the scenes with them meeting again and downey <UNK> who he once was are well done and there is a good amount of emotion and happiness once shepherd finally believes its really her husband <UNK> but from there the film goes downhill there are several sex related scenes that turned me off completely especially downey and shepherd wanting to get together again despite the difference in their age now after that however the film manages to end in the most satisfying way possible considering the circumstances of the plot i was disappointed because i did not expect the film to become so <UNK> by the end there was great potential with this story and the scenes in heaven are well done there is a good theme song sung by peter <UNK> and cher but ultimately the film is not great for a better similar film try heaven can wait decent but i really kind of wish i hadn't seen it because of the scenes in the second half br br out of
<START> when watching this show you are not quite sure whether it is the story or the acting that is more annoying first of all the storyline of each episode is very predictable the writers must have used every clich√© possible you can guess not only the general plot but the <UNK> of the scenes and also the lines of each character making the show some sort of a <UNK> of every police series out there on the top of it all comes the message of the show that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good shall <UNK> and that we should all love each other be better man and better citizens all done in the most <UNK> manner the actors as the vehicles of this message and nothing more than that will use a limited set of acting skills the i am a good carrying person smile the concerned look and the victory is <UNK> body <UNK> while the bad guys have the i'm a bad one <UNK> and the you caught me look followed by the i'm good for nothing and i should be removed from society head <UNK> this kind of also sums up the general development of each show true story or not the show is garbage yet another proof that producers don't give a s t about viewers that we are all thought to be idiots well this series makes every possible attempt to <UNK> the living brains out of you
<START> the movie itself was ok for the kids but i gotta tell ya that scratch the little <UNK> was the funniest character i've ever seen he makes the movie all by himself he's the reason i've just love this movie <UNK> to the crew it made me laugh out loud and always will
<START> and i repeat please do not see this movie this is more than a review this is a warning this sets the record for the worst most <UNK> comedy ever made at least with most of the recent comedies nowadays the gags are crude and flat but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny i never get tired of repeating one of my favorite <UNK> everyone thinks they can do comedy and only 10 percent of them are right comedy is hard this is not some genre any fool can play around with i think it's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to kentucky fried movie basically these <UNK> are comparing their so called comic talents to those of the brilliant jim <UNK> and the <UNK> brothers come on i've seen <UNK> shore movies that are 10 times funnier than the underground comedy movie here's a <UNK> of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie one sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named d <UNK> the whole joke is that he <UNK> his enemies by <UNK> them with <UNK> that's it that's the whole joke wow this is enough to make <UNK> top roll his eyes another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie and in another sketch there's a bag lady beauty contest in which we're exposed to the horrible sights of bikini clad middle aged women with beer guts and stretch marks plus making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny it's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped the whole movie is supposed to be a satire i think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire is truth for anybody who actually enjoyed this crap explain to me what is truthful about any of these gags some of the sketches <UNK> sounded funny on paper but anybody who's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper it probably won't be funny on screen if i tell someone about a big black muscular gay virgin who's saving himself for the right man he or she would probably laugh but watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag i hate how whenever people criticize a low brow comedy like this for not being funny they're regarded as stuck up <UNK> i just saw white chicks recently that's another low brow politically incorrect comedy but i laughed my head off the most offensive thing about the underground comedy movie is it's not funny what the writers and directors don't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn't work there has to be more just think of the famous scene from there's something about mary ironically enough the <UNK> filmmakers put the <UNK> on their special thanks list the joke about the <UNK> wasn't just funny because it involved <UNK> <UNK> there was a <UNK> ben stiller was <UNK> in the bathroom to make sure he didn't go out on a date with a loaded gun then he looked around to see where all the <UNK> went after it was released a knock is on the door and he has to answer it his date mary is at the door and that's when it's revealed that the <UNK> is hanging off ben's ear in this movie there are multiple gags involving characters <UNK> loads of <UNK> at people with no <UNK> whatsoever as jay leno always says this comedy <UNK> not so easy is it keep that in mind vince offer 'cause you weren't cut out for this genre the only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip let's face it nowadays it's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect i know comedy is <UNK> but this movie shouldn't be funny to anybody except maybe the filmmakers themselves as a side note the movie had to have been made before michael clarke <UNK> fame in movies like <UNK> and the green mile there can't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would <UNK> to be part of this amateurish freak show all the others in the cast are either non actors has been actors or b movie stars karen black made a good impression in five easy pieces but i don't think she's done anything of value ever since slash was probably drugged into being in this film gina lee <UNK> is nothing without <UNK> <UNK> is the film's biggest star keeping in mind <UNK> wasn't famous at the time and there are still probably a ton of people who haven't heard of her for good reason usually i'm in support of extremely low budget flicks but this one deserves to drift into obscurity i hope to lord this doesn't become a cult classic shouldn't there be a law against <UNK> crap like this
<START> angela lansbury plays <UNK> a middle aged lady in war torn england during the wwi she has been studying witchcraft by mail and has been secretly learning it in her home she is doing well until three children who have been separated from their parents from the last air raid are sent to stay in angela <UNK> huge house she is not happy about having them because of her secret they only want to go back home the oldest boy is very hard to get along with he is a brat the other two a boy and a girl are just <UNK> about their new place to stay and the lady that is their <UNK> the kids find out about her secret and that is when the fun begins fun and more of it family fun laughter <UNK> adventure something for everyone the special effects are quite good this is a musical the tunes are every bit as catchy to sing later as any of the other disney films add this to your family video library you will not be disappointed
<START> okay i was bored and decided to see this movie but i think the main thing that brought this movie down was that there would be a hour of footage then basically that same hour repeated 4 times it consists of 1 gathering the troops and discussing the attack plan 2 flashbacks to the men's wives 3 the approach of the troops <UNK> in a long line 4 men running up hill and shooting usually the first getting shot in the head then 3 other men <UNK> him 5 defeat of the enemy and calling to base to tell of success 6 men flashing back to wives and singing 10 minute songs that was the basic movie and that same order of events happened about 4 or 5 times and every time it did a flashback to the wives it would show the man then his wife and him there were about 10 men or more who would have a flashback so this took up tons of time other than that the men couldn't kill their enemy except with either <UNK> or <UNK> i liked the music and there was a lot of action though the action was repetitive overall i probably wouldn't see it again but it wasn't too horrible
<START> <UNK> so this is the movie that the next action stars were getting into well i'm glad that i didn't participate and didn't win br br isn't it funny how one can just look at the first 10 seconds and make up ones mind about a movie i mean come on just look at those titles i watched this movie or part of this <UNK> since it was produced for tv and we couldn't bear to watch the whole thing one evening while doing my military service and the audience with me was the typical <UNK> <UNK> of average guys that once in a while watch series like las vegas just for the girls in the show so the bar wasn't really high the most watched movie in my group was girl next door and it wasn't because of the great script d but this movie's total lack of originality acting scripting and just about everything else that makes a movie good made it pretty easy to switch channel to las vegas or was it <UNK> don't remember without any complaints by the rest of the group and that is rare for heavens sake don't by this movie if it's on tv then yes watch it and contemplate on it my conclusion well since joel silver has indeed produced some of the best action films out there die hard matrix 1 to name some i can only say that producers don't give the film it's quality they provide money for the directors and to sell this movie just because it's a joel silver movie is just a desperate attempt to <UNK> the obvious flaws of the crew who really made it
<START> i've never understood the appeal of garbo she always comes across in her films as stuck up not all that <UNK> and that annoying voice that could have drowned out the <UNK> section she was also a very limited actress like gloria <UNK> far better off left in the silent era in this her last film her performance is very average and even <UNK> she tries hard but it all comes to nothing because the script is even worse than her acting br br a would be screwball <UNK> that is never once believable and never gets off the ground even though melvyn douglas manages to get <UNK> in the <UNK> scenes which are really the only amusing thing here br br there was potential but the script fails in almost every department wasting every actor in it douglas and garbo had good enough chemistry together but this one isn't even a spot on <UNK> which i also found to be extremely overrated
<START> this movie reminds me of <UNK> 2002 another art work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature i did not like the movie but i cannot say that it is a bad movie it is just special i reminds me also of camping <UNK> 1996 where a bunch of low class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in <UNK> the same description of people living together side by side against their <UNK> and with all the confrontation of characters that do not match together i also thought about the books by the french writer <UNK> <UNK> who was a writer of the style that is <UNK> i did not like the movie and i also do not like the people who are in it they all seem so vulgar without any basic good taste one could ask the question why do they live they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce forced to live against their will or you could say the hell is on this world
<START> okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a 60 000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldn't you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her and at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her proof i don't know i was not happy with the ending this movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy
<START> the person who wrote the review enough with the <UNK> and spitting already has no grasp of what cultural literary or psycho critique is he <UNK> <UNK> interpretations because they don't seem in line with what the director originally intended so what the importance of a director's or author's intention is not important in critical theory this is known as the author's intentional <UNK> and should be avoided br br http en <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> intentional <UNK> a text or movie can be <UNK> through a number of theories many of which disagree with one another as well as completely ignore the author's intention this is the most fundamental idea of critical theory br br because of this whoever wrote that wall of text wasted a lot of time and effort on insulting zizek in reality anyone who studies theory would immediately <UNK> this guys opinion i suggest you should too as it is completely off point br br that being said if you are at all interested in <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> this movie is a must it <UNK> these theories with popular film making them much more <UNK> and enjoyable than simply reading or thinking about them
<START> this <UNK> k why do they have to make movies that they must know <UNK> k from the beginning i mean look at alien from 1977 if the movie <UNK> about to make is not better than anything made <UNK> of years before why make it i had problems with the plot and who the main character was that's not good either
<START> honestly i was disappointed in <UNK> date super clever title and interesting premise but i don't think it delivered what was it about the main character's desire to <UNK> with his native roots or more likely it was his need to overcome his fear of death but he wasn't set up as someone who has lived his life in fear it seems as if his life was going fine but since <UNK> is approaching he should now start worrying i didn't buy it meanwhile the supporting characters in the film didn't seem to have needs that <UNK> into an <UNK> story they were all just doing their thing running parallel to the main character also what was treated as a curse looked more like a coincidence who cursed the family why when finally why didn't he just plan on staying in his apartment all day on his birthday those are my criticisms but i did love the shots of seattle cinematography was beautiful acting was good in the times it wasn't outstanding
<START> probably the best film of the year for me this small french film centers on put upon office secretary carla <UNK> <UNK> who spends her days doing other men's jobs uncredited and being the source of their <UNK> and <UNK> conversation which is all too clear to her as being partially deaf she reads lips a change is set in motion when she hires newly <UNK> con paul vincent <UNK> as her assistant the relationship which develops between them is the centre of the film mutual <UNK> for vastly different reasons bonds them carla becomes attracted to paul and to the fact that he makes her feel attractive for what seems like the first time paul does nothing to <UNK> her feelings because he needs her help he owes money to a local gangster and forms a plan to steal from him which will involve <UNK> skill of reading lips i think the main thing that pushes the film way above an average suspense drama is the amazing chemistry between the two stars throughout the whole film no matter what other characters are on screen you can feel this amazing bond between carla and paul i cannot remember when i have witnessed such sexual chemistry between two actors <UNK> <UNK> gives a brilliant performance she won the french <UNK> for best actress you never feel like you are watching a piece of acting this really is carla the <UNK> like vincent <UNK> is also wonderful he makes a somewhat unappealing character both appealing and attractive i loved this film because of these two people and both times when i had finished watching it i wanted to go back into the cinema and become involved with them all over again
<START> this highly derivative film will be entertaining for the many who have not seen some of the more obscure anime films i enjoyed most of it especially after the rather flat opening minutes in the museum although the pre title sequence is very entertaining and includes some of the better bits of animation james garner as the commander and leonard <UNK> as the king give impressive performances
<START> i have been an admirer of edward <UNK> work for years and it was such a pleasure to be able to see the man at work thanks to jennifer <UNK> documentary the severe beauty of the ship breaking yard in <UNK> the stone <UNK> in <UNK> the enormous <UNK> plant in china the <UNK> old <UNK> in shanghai that are just waiting to be torn down these landscapes are captured so well by the photographer and the filmmaker br br at times i thought of old tv documentaries on abandoned coal mines and plastic mold <UNK> the sort of stuff i grew up watching <UNK> work has the great value of pointing out how the industrial activity has only <UNK> to asia it has not stopped the strangest scene for me was the computer <UNK> yard somewhere in china the waste had a threatening air about it while the workers were very <UNK>
<START> i was going to bed with my <UNK> last night and while she was <UNK> her teeth i <UNK> channels until i came across this chinese movie called the king of masks at first i thought it was going to be a kung fu movie so i started watching it and then it immediately captured me in and i had to finish it br br the little girl in the movie was absolutely <UNK> she was such a great actor for being so little maybe the fact it was in chinese so the english was dubbed made it harder for me to tell but she really seemed to be in character perfectly i felt so bad for the girl as she kept trying to please her boss but everything just turned out rotten lol even when she brings him another <UNK> just so he can pass on his art it turns out that kid was kidnapped so he gets arrested and has 5 days to live lol whatever she touches in an effort to be nice to her grandpa just <UNK> br br in the end he sees how much love is in her and teaches her the art of masks which is just so heartwarming after all the <UNK> in the movie br br definitely a gem and totally original br br scott
<START> what's good about it some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan doesn't rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its <UNK> moments even if you've seen everything there's still a few things in this film that will make your jaw drop br br what could have been better about it the acting was at times flat and unconvincing it had a shot on video quality in some places though it mostly achieved the atmosphere it was <UNK> for and the camera work is full of needless close ups of meaningless actions though the effects are genuinely creepy i think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them the ending seemed rushed and <UNK> over what could have been more <UNK> moments the viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves not as a challenge by the filmmakers but because they just missed it br br still a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average well worth the rental
<START> this is a very funny movie i have no idea whether it <UNK> well into other languages or not however i do think men all over the world can identify with frank and his thoughts to some extent these thoughts are hugely entertaining and women will also enjoy this movie i'm sure br br all cast members perform well and this film could have been a tremendous hit all over the world if it was made in england or the us but for those of you who are fortunate enough to understand swedish you are in for a treat br br highly recommended
<START> i bought this movie from <UNK> <UNK> used movie bin and the cover caused me to laugh <UNK> so i bought it for <UNK> the movie itself is retarded and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the whole film that hardly look alike not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to <UNK> a monkey br br the director more than likely committed a murder suicide with the <UNK> after the movie <UNK> in a preview for some other low rent warner bros film and he ended up <UNK> money to the studio it also doesn't help that he wasn't even infamous for the terrible job he did he wasn't even known for producing a <UNK> <UNK> film br br why was this movie ever made
<START> it has been some years since i saw this but remember it and would like to see it again it kind of became a therapy for me with a personal experience of my own br br a thirty five year old man <UNK> over a high school baseball game in which he missed the ball and his team lost he thinks about it 20 years later if only i'd hit that ball and how his life would be better because of it then he gets a chance to find out and gets a little more than he <UNK> for br br it reminds me so much of when i was in high school i twice tried out for our <UNK> dance team and didn't make it this team was the closest thing to a <UNK> in my school if you were on it you were all that i didn't try out till my last two years of <UNK> and after the second time i took it really hard i'd hit and <UNK> my leg badly just before <UNK> and wore <UNK> to cover the <UNK> and that caused me to not make it that was in 1987 br br through the years even now sometimes i think if only i hadn't hit my leg i would've never worn those stupid <UNK> now i don't sit and think my life would be any better or even any different had i made it but seeing this movie made me realize that we never really know how different things may be by changing one little thing way back in the past who knows it could have changed the course of events to the point that i wouldn't have met my son's father br br i would recommend this movie to anyone who has that one moment in the past they wish they could change be careful what you wish for
<START> i caught this movie at a small screening held by members of my <UNK> <UNK> club we were <UNK> that this would be the <UNK> madness of <UNK> and this movie more than delivered br br tom hanks plays <UNK> a young man re starting his college career after <UNK> for a <UNK> what we the viewer find out as the movie progresses is that <UNK> was hopelessly addicted to a role playing game called <UNK> and monsters a game that he gets re <UNK> with after a <UNK> group <UNK> him for a campaign br br this movie is laughable on many many levels one scene features the group <UNK> by <UNK> which is probably the best way i can describe it while i'm sure that this was meant to be <UNK> in some way as most <UNK> know it's horribly inaccurate most role play sessions are done in well lit rooms usually over some <UNK> <UNK> and a can of <UNK> br br the acting while not oscar caliber isn't gut <UNK> awful either this is one of tom <UNK> first roles and <UNK> buddies and bachelor party were still a year or two over the horizon the supporting cast while not very memorable still hand forth decent performances br br mainly the badness lies in the fact that it was a made for tv movie that shows the dangers of <UNK> worth a view if you and your friends are planning a bad movie night
<START> <UNK> featuring the weakest <UNK> vampires ever seen accompanied by one of the most <UNK> pretentious scores ever written and with <UNK> the vampire who's every move and spoken word was so ridiculous that i burst out laughing half the times and rolled my eyes the rest br br the vampires don't seem to have any special powers at all except for strength sometimes being able to switch off a <UNK> with their mind one time and that's it really ever imagine count dracula <UNK> <UNK> from a fight 'cause he ran out of bullets neither did i practically any other movie dracula would eat this one for breakfast skin his followers and use their bones as <UNK> br br the main plot of the movie is that a human family of four gets caught up in a vampire gang fight <UNK> vs some old <UNK> it could have been some good old b flick fun but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a bit too seriously and ends up ruining the remaining part of the movie not already ruined by clay bats mediocre acting and the laughable screenplay br br in the end it's just too silly to be funny sure it has some amusing moments but they're few and far apart
<START> it's frequently said that movies can never equal the original book well in this case not only the movie is not as good as the book but is an insult to the book i'd rather see <UNK> <UNK> novel turned on fire than into this something which the director probably calls adaptation br br all the beautiful philosophy that asks is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders or cope with the unbearable <UNK> of being is put aside and instead all the movie deals with is daniel day <UNK> i cannot say <UNK> sexual adventures with his dumb wife his mistress and his other <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> already said it bad directors make bad movies don't waste your time and money read the book instead it's really worth it
<START> this contains many many spoilers not that it matters since everything is so <UNK> obvious br br oh my god where do i start well here this is the first time i have ever come home from a movie and said i have to get on imdb and write a review of this now it is my <UNK> duty such is the badness of this flick br br begin <UNK> but let me just state one thing before i start i'm not some <UNK> art major film noir <UNK> in fact i went to the college at the other end of mass <UNK> in <UNK> the one where the actual smart people without rich <UNK> and trust <UNK> go which should put me <UNK> in the nerd who would <UNK> love comic book films <UNK> group and still i hated this film my viewing <UNK> is for the <UNK> cinematic <UNK> that includes the die <UNK> bond flicks <UNK> and the grail i wish the titanic had never sunk not so much for the lives lost but so we wouldn't have been subjected to that dung heap of a film and the single and only reason i will watch a <UNK> french art film is if there is a young and frequently <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in it i even gave maximum <UNK> one of its precious few <UNK> here on imdb for god's sake so i'm as shallow as they come therefore i'm not <UNK> this film because i'm looking for some standard of cinematic excellence it's because <UNK> stinks like a three week old dead goat end <UNK> br br ok there's so much badness here that i have to try to <UNK> it here goes br br ms garner one of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot <UNK> i have no idea why my wife wanted to i think that between this and finding <UNK> the latter was the <UNK> film you know the red outfit she's advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see you see her in it twice once at the beginning once at the end <UNK> in the rest she basically looks like what <UNK> would look like if he were a female lots of <UNK> and black clothes which brings me to the incredible range of expression <UNK> shows in her acting ranging from <UNK> all the way to <UNK> and crying oh my god you'd think she was being forced to date ben affleck or something horrible like that um wait br br the bad guys gal they show about the same range of expression and acting ability that you'd expect from a slightly <UNK> <UNK> at least next to <UNK> performance it doesn't stand out too badly one guy's role is to stand there and be huge <UNK> is to stand there and have stuff come out of him and the woman's role is to stand there and breathe on and or kiss people they manage to pull these incredible <UNK> off the main bad guy has the most difficult role of all he has to simultaneously a appear angry and b appear asian he does a fine job at this i think there was a fifth bad guy gal but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in self defense br br plot twists this movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the <UNK> national convention let's just put it this way my wife who has only been in the u s for half a year and speaks only a small amount of english <UNK> this to me when the girl first appears in <UNK> pad and i swear to god i am not making this up she go to house to kill girl and father too and this is before the father has even appeared on the screen now my wife isn't stupid but she isn't being <UNK> by <UNK> for her gifts either and she's had zero exposure to <UNK> or the comic book genre and she figured this out in <UNK> seconds with no <UNK> and no prior information such is the blatant <UNK> of this film br br rarely before seen stupidity ok so there's this big dude in the film he can take a <UNK> of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like it's <UNK> and he can take a vicious <UNK> stab to the chest and just bend the metal or melt it or something more <UNK> kicking in thank god but <UNK> jumps on his head and he explodes an <UNK> <UNK> ok such is the mind numbing stupidity of this film br br <UNK> i'm starting to feel a cerebral <UNK> coming on so i have to stop but you have been warned if you have to intentionally slash your own <UNK> to prevent yourself from going to see this movie do it and if <UNK> is going to come please let it be before this comes out on dvd
<START> the underground comedy movie is possibly the worst train <UNK> i've ever seen luckily i didn't pay for this movie and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again <UNK> that it was so awful but he needed to prove to me how awful it was i love off color comedy i figured at the least it would have that and i would be entertained no instead the acting was so awful the jokes were extremely cheesy and the plot was no where to be found maybe there wasn't supposed to be a plot so i can't hold that against this movie it's pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a bat by batman a man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat hilarious simply genius i got the feeling watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just didn't understand or perhaps it's the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked away in a vault and dumped in the <UNK> ocean br br p s don't buy this movie
<START> it seems more than passing strange that such utter dreck as dukes of hazzard and the hills have eyes the new version can find dvd <UNK> while older and far superior works such as this film are nowhere to be found with all the on going debate about the morality or lack thereof of <UNK> and interest in espionage consider the multiple jack ryan bourne <UNK> and mission impossible productions this would seem to be an obvious choice for release on dvd true it looks like a 1968 motion picture because it is a 1968 motion picture but style consideration aside this is still a production that actually has something valuable to say and has plenty of plots twists to keep an audience entertained if nothing else will somebody please consider getting the soundtrack onto some kind of cd whether it be a <UNK> with other <UNK> music or as a stand alone i don't know if industry people bother to read what we fans have to say about their products but if you are reading this and other comments please take us seriously we are paying for your lavish homes with our hard earned dollars spent on tickets dvds and <UNK> give us what we want all that said if you are reading this and have not seen this film <UNK> for it's release so you may see what those of us who have seen it are talking about you will not be disappointed
<START> great movie enough laughs and action for any audience br br since the last person who posted on this movie took it upon themselves to call woody allen incestuous and not comment on the film here i am br br the film follows an unlikely duo johansson and allen as they follow a tip given to them by the ghost of a recently deceased english reporter their search takes them into the home of the killer and eventually to a somewhat tragic end but don't let the plot fool you the film truly is hilarious and the acting is superb br br it seems that as directors reach a certain age they really get things right clint eastwood allen and <UNK> all seem to making some of the most imaginative work of their respective careers also from watching the movie in a <UNK> theater you can just tell that people really love woody allen and are ready for him to really make a comeback the second he walked on screen audience lit up there's just something about the man and he really shines in scoop br br check it out it's worth the trip
<START> one of america's most brilliant film directors was without question <UNK> kazan his directorial genius was not particularly suited to taut thrillers since kazan needed more room to breathe and to be slower and more subtle however <UNK> in the <UNK> is a first rate social thriller and is if anything more relevant to today than it was to 1950 when it was released the themes of illegal immigrants people <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rapid <UNK> around the world of <UNK> a worried richard widmark says 'i could be in any american city in ten hours and in africa tomorrow ' ethnic isolation and <UNK> are today's concerns more than ever this film features a spectacular film debut by jack palance and a wonderful performance by barbara <UNK> <UNK> two casting <UNK> of genius richard widmark is allowed not to be a psychopath for once and is a deeply caring <UNK> loving intense hero of the people he leads basically a one man campaign to stop an <UNK> of <UNK> plague in new orleans struggling to convince <UNK> politicians and <UNK> policemen that there is a problem there is a race against time to find the small time crooks who have <UNK> the plague from a dead illegal immigrant within 48 hours before the whole city and as they are always reminding us the whole country are <UNK> with the worst thing since the <UNK> <UNK> one amazing scene where jack palance who is infected is prevented from climbing aboard a ship by a rat <UNK> on the rope is ironic in the extreme reminding us in the most gruesome terms that humans can be the worst <UNK> and <UNK> of all the highly dramatic chase scenes in what they call 'the coffee <UNK> at the <UNK> rivals the most inventive climax scenes of hitchcock and with just as spectacular a setting many non professionals appear in the film which has the gritty realism of well something called reality kazan really takes the cameras into places where even people rarely went and where even rats would have thought twice this film was a major feat of social realism if it lacks the electricity of the most highly charged thrillers it is because kazan took it so seriously that he could not hype it up for after all the threat of plague is serious enough to scare anybody without the need for extra guns and <UNK> the only unfortunate thing about the film is the title which gives a false suggestion of <UNK> but kazan was anything but superficial he clearly considered this project a public duty to alert us to genuine possibilities if only those possibilities had <UNK> today but alas they are getting worse every day one day after a worldwide plague this film may be shown to a few survivors as an example of how an <UNK> was contained on film but its lessons were forgotten
<START> this movie is some of the worst crap i have ever seen i literally got a sharp pain in my head while watching this movie the cgi was awful and the story was just a waste of <UNK> dean <UNK> character was mr super <UNK> i can figure out anything except he can't seem to work his own helicopter correctly the biggest problem was the split screen camera work i felt like i was watching the brady bunch or something only it wasn't different people in the boxes just close ups and different views of the same thing i can only figure that the actors really needed the money because this movie wasn't worth the film it was shot on
<START> tony scott has never been a very good director but every film he's made after <UNK> tide seems to bring him one step closer to being the <UNK> worst working today michael bay may fall into the same category but at least his big dumb <UNK> epics entertain on some <UNK> perverse level and like other overblown hollywood <UNK> de lovely and <UNK> of a dangerous mind for instance <UNK> the lives of pretentious overrated or outright shallow <UNK> given an aura of <UNK> by a society that <UNK> on the <UNK> behind the scenes details domino is a film that begins with little potential and <UNK> that <UNK> amount before the sixty minute mark with an already <UNK> running time of <UNK> minutes the film feels twice as long and spending time with characters this <UNK> superficial and forgettable unlike the superior rules of attraction scott's attempts to <UNK> the proceedings with irony via <UNK> smug self aware rich girl voice over only draws attention to the film's <UNK> <UNK> becomes an act only <UNK> could find <UNK> the story spoiled upper <UNK> babe domino harvey <UNK> knightley in an <UNK> <UNK> performance as shallow as her gorgeous looks is sick of the shallow <UNK> of the rich and famous in los angeles and <UNK> gruff bounty hunters mickey rourke and edgar <UNK> to learn a more exciting trade along the way there are double crosses <UNK> media attention courtesy of a tongue in cheek christopher walken <UNK> in his trademark <UNK> and laughable hints at romance scott cuts the film together in segments that rarely last more than a few seconds <UNK> up the resolution to make the film a <UNK> <UNK> nightmare that's frankly unpleasant to watch if scott's given an opportunity to <UNK> frame an image ghost it or <UNK> it in some way he will but all this tacky <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> what little plot characterization and suspense the film has to say nothing for its <UNK> entertainment value most of the characters come off as either <UNK> or stereotypical <UNK> both observe the unbearable several minute segment where an african american introduces a new list of racial <UNK> on jerry springer and i found myself wishing they would all get the <UNK> end of our <UNK> <UNK> by the end domino is utter <UNK> trash whatever interest in this individual scott hoped to inspire in his audience it is lost in a sea of <UNK> inducing <UNK> <UNK> a few minutes in
<START> a very attractive and capable cast is lost in this deadly boring rehash of the slasher sub genre the plot a simply a collection of cliches and set pieces that we've all seen a hundred times before has great potential as an insomnia treatment
<START> oh <UNK> there are so many other films i want to see out there i got stuck with my nephew for the weekend and this is what he wanted yeah br br i used to watch this show when i was in college it was mindless kinda fun and somewhat action oriented the show had a good heart tho and the characters were cute no one ever got killed or even hurt badly it was like a cartoon come to life cut to 2005 what happened this one doesn't work as others have said there simply isn't a cohesive story and the performances are weird almost annoying definitely not faithful to the original characters the whole thing is a like a mad tv skit and it lasts over 100 minutes this was one of the few times i've been embarrassed watching a film what were they thinking as best i can tell must've been for the product marketing toys etc all i can say is let this one die a quick death it makes the original dukes of hazzard seem like masterpiece theater br br i think the only remake left to do from tv is <UNK> island good luck
<START> a couple janet and richard go camping out in the woods near a giant swamp after camping and enjoying nature the couple takes shelter in what they think is an abandoned farm house soon a pair of escaped <UNK> show up and after much <UNK> of the inevitable they proceed to rape janet and lock richard in a <UNK> br br this last house on the left like film has to be one of the most underrated horror films ever made it's one of the more sick and twisted early 70s <UNK> moreover i found this to be quite enchanting and beautiful in it's perverse tone i love <UNK> terror the music definitely helps lend a sense of personality to the film as well as a lot of beauty i found the film to be quite creepy br br the flaws mainly have to do with the pacing of the film which is to say that the film is rather slow and meandering while i didn't mind the pacing due to the beauty and suspense of the film in question i do think that it will both most people the acting isn't too good nor is the dialogue at least in the early scenes this film takes a little more patience than usual and it's really not for everyone br br in short this was a good film not the greatest horror film i've ever seen but it is certainly a lot of fun it's not exactly the <UNK> film to find it's possible to find it in the used section of a lot of stores if you look hard enough it's not for everyone but if you're a fan of trash cinema then it's definitely worth checking out
<START> fay grim is the <UNK> of a story begun ten years earlier with hartley's henry fool i haven't seen the earlier film and i don't know if that's a good thing or not i can only regard the current film on its own merits br br for most people hal hartley's style of film making is something that you either like or you don't his combination of action drama absurdity and dry ironic humour really <UNK> with me and fay grim is no exception it has an air of <UNK> written intelligent parody that had myself and many in the melbourne international film festival audience laughing out loud for the first half of the film it was relentless and delivered with deadpan <UNK> it's a style of humour sadly lacking in cinemas and a welcome relief to the mindless teen comedies that hollywood <UNK> out like <UNK> br br during the second half of the film the humour starts to thin as the film <UNK> into an international espionage conspiracy thriller whether this was hartley's intention or whether he ran out of ideas is not clear but i think a bit of editing or re writing to cut fifteen minutes off the film would have <UNK> the film's original momentum br br the performances were generally good particularly parker posey and jeff goldblum who had the most screen time <UNK> <UNK> james <UNK> carl <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> all played good support roles the film's visuals were nice set in new york paris berlin and <UNK> and the music also by hartley was good without being <UNK> the film is well written and i enjoyed this it immensely if you like hartley's earlier work you'll probably like this
<START> it was by accident that i was <UNK> the tv channels and found this wonderful film about two beautiful human beings who become attracted to each other in a very innocent and virgin like approach to each other ethan hawke jesse tape <UNK> and julie <UNK> celine er <UNK> tv series nicole this gal and guy will warm your very heart and soul and make you think deeply into your past relationships and how you really wish you had followed your hearts strings with a guy or gal you deep down loved and lost track of over the years jesse and celine have great conversation and deep eye contact with a great <UNK> explosion between the two of them i am looking forward to the sequel to this film in 2004 and if you have viewed this film you will feel the same way
<START> after <UNK> vietnam and the dark days of the <UNK> and jimmy carter <UNK> what the world needed was a good old fashioned chapter play hero taking on <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in the america of 1936 or the <UNK> of south america in a series of fantastic <UNK> adventures unfortunately what it got in 1975 was doc savage the man of <UNK> perhaps the best that can be said of legendary producer george <UNK> final film is that his often beautifully designed but sadly flat adaptation of kenneth <UNK> pulp <UNK> novels probably had george lucas and phil kaufman leaving the theatre and saying to each other we can do better than that and adding a <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> and some much needed character flaws to the mix br br a big part of the problem is that doc savage is in many ways even harder to write for than superman ¬ñ <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a scientific and intellectual genius in the <UNK> <UNK> blonde <UNK> muscle bound body of a greek god or rather the form of tv's tarzan ron <UNK> a rather dull charlton heston clone here there's simply nothing he can't do and more <UNK> nothing that can harm him the man is the virtual incarnation of hitler's <UNK> <UNK> no surprise that the dvd is only available in germany albeit with all american values and just in case there should ever be anything he's overlooked not that there ever is he has not one but five <UNK> in his <UNK> the less than fabulous five a <UNK> an <UNK> and even an <UNK> i can accept and at a stretch i could possibly even go as far as to see the possible need for a construction engineer but what kind of hero takes a criminal lawyer with him on his adventures in reality <UNK> brain trust were probably added because with the hero so <UNK> <UNK> and practically perfect in every way ¬ñ even <UNK> wouldn't put a <UNK> in him there needed to be someone at risk in the stories though with the exception of paul <UNK> they're all so horribly badly cast and <UNK> as are most parts in the film you'd happily kill them all off during the opening titles the villains fare no better with paul <UNK> <UNK> all the menace of a <UNK> teacher as captain <UNK> scott walker no a different one delivering one of <UNK> worst accents is it meant to be scottish irish <UNK> greek <UNK> or some <UNK> no one has ever heard of while <UNK> <UNK> marilyn monroe ish dumb blonde <UNK> gives paris no relation a run for her money in the <UNK> bimbo stakes br br even with those <UNK> this should have been much better than it is considering the various ingredients ¬ñ lost <UNK> a pool of gold a <UNK> with a <UNK> and a deadly poison that comes alive all wrapped up in a quest to discover why <UNK> father was murdered unfortunately it's a question of tone in the 60s and 70s pulp <UNK> weren't brooding figures prone to state of the art action scenes and special effects but were treated as somewhat comical figures of low budget camp fun with action scenes quickly knocked off on the cheap almost as an <UNK> the films aimed purely at the <UNK> market you know for kids there have long been <UNK> that the original cut was more straight faced ¬ñ and certainly much of the camp value has been added in post production be it the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> eye the comical <UNK> <UNK> various fighting styles in the final dust up with captain <UNK> or don <UNK> <UNK> ho lyrics to john philip <UNK> patriotic <UNK> ¬ñ but plenty was in the film to begin with after all it's hard to see how one of the <UNK> <UNK> making phone calls from a giant <UNK> <UNK> was ever intended as anything other than a joke that falls flat while <UNK> explanation to pamela <UNK> of why he never dates girls could be a scene written for adam <UNK> batman instead the funniest moments are usually purely unintentional such as doc displaying his sixth sense by er <UNK> his <UNK> apple br br perhaps an even bigger problem is that while promising on paper the action is handled in an almost relentlessly mundane fashion be it chasing a native assassin on the <UNK> of new york <UNK> or escaping from a <UNK> full of bad guys even the winning notion of animated glowing green snakes <UNK> through the air as they poison their victims fails to raise any enthusiasm from director michael anderson having demonstrated their own <UNK> a couple of scenes earlier doc manages to <UNK> them with no more than a chair and an electric fan by simply pulling the <UNK> on them br br still aside from <UNK> various vehicles all <UNK> with his <UNK> and looking more <UNK> plastic than <UNK> the production design is often rather handsome even if it is very obviously l a standing in for new york while fred <UNK> cinematography <UNK> the film often looks good despite the low budget and it's good to see a superhero movie that doesn't spend most of its running time on an origin story though one is left with the suspicion that doc <UNK> fully formed from the <UNK> of <UNK> himself br br it's a film i'd really like to like more but it just feels like 100 minutes of lost opportunities no wonder doc savage the arch enemy of evil the sequel so <UNK> promised in the end credits never happened
<START> i cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is suffice it to say anytime i'm depressed about how unfair or <UNK> things seem this is the movie i go rent to put me in the right frame of mind the background music makes you realize the <UNK> of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness the indian girl that sings is but one example of a character in this film who does not try hard and is happy as a result <UNK> the <UNK> co worker of <UNK> ashley judd is another her eyes and smile could make the hardest person's day i watch this movie and i dream of better days to come or of a good conversation with friends and i realize that being alone ruby is alone quite often isn't the same as being lonely recommended for anyone who enjoys a thoughtful <UNK> of a movie
<START> <UNK> in on the demons meets <UNK> trend of the late '60s early '70s that most <UNK> included the <UNK> of rosemary's baby the exorcist and the omen the sentinel is an addition that's just as good albeit the most overlooked of the lot in a way it combines the best elements of those films and <UNK> in a dash of <UNK> the tenant which came out the same year for good measure a new york model unable to commit to her lawyer boyfriend takes up <UNK> in a moss <UNK> <UNK> that initially seems like the perfect locale she meets a <UNK> old <UNK> of a neighbor the brilliant burgess meredith plus the other off center <UNK> kept awake by loud noises above her apartment she soon discovers that a mute priest and herself are the only residents in the otherwise deserted building from there director michael winner death wish kicks this supernatural thriller into gear and there is a <UNK> glee to the <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> on his heroine aided by a brilliant ensemble cast a subtle storyline and excellent makeup fx by dick smith the exorcist the sentinel is a genuinely creepy horror flick
<START> this was a very brief episode that appeared in one of the night gallery show back in 1971 the episode starred sue <UNK> of <UNK> movie fame and joseph <UNK> who play a baby <UNK> and a vampire respectively the vampire hires a baby <UNK> to watch his child which appears to be some kind of werewolf or monster while he goes out at night for blood the baby <UNK> is totally oblivious to the <UNK> appearance when she first sees him and only starts to put two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror has an odd collection of books in the library on the occult and hears strange noises while the vampire goes to talk to the child she realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally she <UNK> out the door the vampire comes out looking puzzled and the episode is over i don't know what purpose it was to make such an <UNK> episode that lasted just 5 minutes they should just have expanded the earlier episode by those same 5 minutes and <UNK> this one a total wasted effort
<START> this is a candidate for the single most disappointing movie experience of my lifetime cool title excellent director i saw to die for and <UNK> cowboy before this and hey uma thurman in the cast how can you go wrong well that is a question that <UNK> in my <UNK> for hours after i watched this turkey br br disjointed and unfunny in an attempt to be offbeat this is a dead zone of a movie that should be avoided at all costs its critical <UNK> was well deserved you have here one of those rare films that does not contain a single redeeming quality zero out of
<START> i have seen the perfect son about three times i fail to see how this film is a gay film i am not even gay but i don't see it as a gay film it is a film with a gay character i can't see why every film with a gay character should be strictly a film about being gay i find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death the death of someone who is your <UNK> i think theo turns his life around fairly quickly after <UNK> because he wants to and watching his brother dying in front of him makes him <UNK> his life i found the dialog in the scene when theo tells ryan he is going to be a father to be very moving ryan states that he doesn't want to know about the things he is never going to see or share with anyone isn't that horrific and sad i highly recommend the film
<START> having read many of the comments here i'm surprised that no one has recognized this as basically an overlong remake of a twilight zone episode from 1960 called mirror image starring vera miles rod <UNK> did a much better job of creating an effective spooky tale in 24 minutes than sean <UNK> did in <UNK> minutes with this tedious <UNK> a short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending but in a feature film there should be a bit more substance and the story should make sense sadly substance and sense are two things missing from the broken yes it has some moments but they are not enough to justify your time some further observations although this is clearly a contemporary story not one character in the movie has a <UNK> and even though a car accident is the event that gets the story going there is never any reference to an insurance company to the person who was driving the other car or to the police who would have been required to do a report my advice skip this bore and watch the original instead
<START> i rented this thinking it might be interesting and it might have been an interesting story except that is was told in such an uninteresting manner hard to follow strange editing disjointed storyline the characters <UNK> all in all a dreadfully dull waste of time i just couldn't get into it and didn't care what happened to the characters not even ian <UNK> could save this film unless you need a cure for insomnia i'd skip it 3 10 and that's being generous
<START> what can i say a kamal <UNK> movie being horrible he acts very well but it is a horrible story along with horrible direction in my kind opinion the director <UNK> <UNK> must give up directing there is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie apart from that one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes there was no <UNK> in the movie <UNK> is just running out of stories but both kamal <UNK> and <UNK> act really well the villains look too ugly though their performance was not bad i do not think this is a sunday afternoon movie like <UNK> which you can see with the family you will not get sleep seeing this movie however harris <UNK> again did a great job and that is why i have given this movie 4 out of 10 his song <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> and <UNK> apart from that great cinematography on the whole this is just a bad bad movie kamal <UNK> i think should have rejected this movie
<START> women they're all <UNK> br br no not a good translation not at all this <UNK> behind the previous year's <UNK> army entirely missing the special small screen magic of the <UNK> television sitcom original and failing to play interestingly at all with the big screen you could just about say that this film well represents a britain entering decline and more precisely even than that a british film industry entering decline and that is hardly a recommendation is it to be an <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> br br all that remains after the subtlety of the tv original has been <UNK> stripped away by cliff owen <UNK> and simpson are endless <UNK> musical <UNK> yawn from the ron <UNK> theme <UNK> sentimentality that shoddy thick <UNK> ending how much <UNK> does the second <UNK> film seem in comparison an <UNK> <UNK> with director and writers seemingly <UNK> themselves completely fully <UNK> to something like the <UNK> <UNK> yours truly on this site from 1973 the <UNK> there is a strangely <UNK> cut <UNK> tone about the scene where harold is beaten up in a <UNK> club that i partly hate and <UNK> it so far as a friend <UNK> from the mood of the tv series but this at least seems an original <UNK> and <UNK> of tensions just rising to the <UNK> in the britain of 1972 there is however an implied prostitute <UNK> of a <UNK> of <UNK> who turns loose woman <UNK> <UNK> poor <UNK> <UNK> and beyond caricature writing of the <UNK> element not to mention surprisingly <UNK> performances from the usually <UNK> leads <UNK> and corbett <UNK> with the script and indeed fail to cure it of an essential ham what would anthony <UNK> <UNK> have made of it all i will merely <UNK> that a few moments just about work <UNK> those where g s play things a little more carefully and b c touch <UNK> nerves and it is not on the whole an unwatchable affair br br but and oh how this pains me to say it it is tiresome boring both <UNK> detached from reality and what made the tv series great and also fully in tune with the lazy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> it that'll do ' <UNK> of much of what was allowed to pass for mainstream film making in the britain of the time
<START> a mediocre sci fi channel original picture a little <UNK> but not much the nuclear powered submarine u s s jimmy carter is on a mission deep below thick <UNK> ice near the north pole when it is attacked by giant super charged electric <UNK> a member of the crew <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> thinks she has <UNK> a way to communicate with the monsters but is not given much chance for vague reasons also among the crew are david keith mark <UNK> and sean <UNK> this movie could have been somewhat better if the <UNK> monsters were not so cartoonish
<START> having lived in <UNK> my whole life in the same town that marlene moore grew up in i've heard stories of her from my parents grandparents and family members so when i found out that they would be filming a movie about her and that the beginning would be shot on my street and her house quite close to mine i was excited br br if you read the book rock a bye baby which is about marlene moore you get quite the different image of her as a person she was considered <UNK> beautiful by people who really had the chance to know her with the exception of her own family who frequently abused her as a child with the exception of one of her brothers also if you live in my area and are intelligent enough to listen to those around you who knew her from school you'd find out that she was truly wounded before she even set foot in an institution she was always <UNK> and what would seem like an <UNK> to learn in a school environment was actually embarrassment over the fact that she was unable to br br marlene did not deserve the life she was given with the lack of help she desperately needed to receive it was the government and the people around her that aided further in her death by not attempting to understand her needs and why she did what she did i still find myself <UNK> that she was put in jail for self defense from a man who tried to rape her as her brother once said they didn't know what to do with her so they locked her away and it killed her i believe in that with all my heart br br rest in peace marlene you deserve it so much
<START> as <UNK> did with straw dogs and kubrick with a clockwork orange director john <UNK> delivers an effective film about man's violent side in deliverance arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970s burt reynolds jon voight ned beatty and <UNK> cox portray four <UNK> <UNK> who decide to take a <UNK> trip down the wild <UNK> river in northern georgia before it is <UNK> up into what reynolds calls one big dead lake br br but the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these city boys <UNK> through their woods and the following day continuing on down the river beatty and voight are <UNK> and sexually <UNK> the film's infamous <UNK> sequence by two vicious mountain men bill <UNK> herbert cowboy coward thus what started out as nothing more than a <UNK> through the <UNK> has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as <UNK> br br james <UNK> adapted the screenplay from his own best selling book and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker often known for its <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> sequences deliverance is also quite a pulse <UNK> ordeal with the four leading men superb in their roles and <UNK> and coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times a must see film for those willing to take a chance
<START> this is a really interesting movie it is an action movie with comedy mixed in foxx teams up with comedian <UNK> in this movie to give it a comedic spin it will keep you wondering whats going to happen to foxx next it was a well shot movie the director used the right colors in this movie dark blue colors to give it the right kind of feel <UNK> <UNK> also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen she plays her role well even jamie kennedy is in this movie it's worth seeing it you haven't seen it it's definitely worth having if you are a jamie foxx fan it deserves more credit than it is actually given
<START> i really love this show it's like reading a book and each chapter leaves you wanting more it gets you thinking about what is going to happen in the next episode and the struggle of trying to maintain their friendship throughout the years after each episode ends it leaves a sweet bitter taste in your mouth knowing that one the show was good you can't wait for the next episode and it really gets you thinking about what actually happens to the friends throughout the twenty years and two the fact that the show has been put on <UNK> and we will not see the show finish in it's entirety fox obviously do not know what they have done they claim that they are losing viewers in the 18 <UNK> category they clearly do not know what people want to see if they got rid of a good show such as reunion i have one <UNK> though that i would like to raise if they were to bring the show back and it went on for another season how would it work since each episode is done in the period of a year and the story is based on what happens in the span of twenty years your answers are most welcome bring back reunion bring back reunion
<START> mabel at the wheel is one of those movies with a behind the scenes story that's more interesting than the movie itself this was <UNK> <UNK> comedy for <UNK> during his year of <UNK> and his first two <UNK> here he played one of his last out and out villain roles although the feature length <UNK> <UNK> romance was yet to come and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself in fact <UNK> conflicts with director and co star mabel <UNK> almost got him fired from the studio br br chaplin hadn't gotten along with his earlier directors henry <UNK> and george <UNK> but according to his autobiography having to take direction from a mere girl was the last straw charlie and mabel <UNK> <UNK> during the making of this film chaplin was still a newcomer at <UNK> and his colleagues didn't know what to make of him but everyone loved mabel producer mack <UNK> was on the verge of firing chaplin when he learned that the <UNK> films were catching on and <UNK> wanted more of them a s a p so chaplin was promised the chance to direct himself in return for finishing this movie the way mabel wanted it br br unfortunately none of that drama is visible on screen in mabel at the wheel which looks like typical <UNK> chaos the story concerns an auto race in which <UNK> beau harry mccoy is <UNK> to compete but wicked charlie and his henchmen <UNK> the <UNK> and mabel must take the wheel in his place for all the racing around brick <UNK> and finger biting the film is frankly short on laughs but there are a few points of interest there's some good cinematography and editing in the race sequence though there aren't really any gags just lots of frantic activity chaplin himself looks odd sporting a goat like beard on his <UNK> and wearing the top hat and <UNK> coat he wore in his very first film appearance making a living but the outfit suits the old fashioned <UNK> he displays throughout at least it's novel to watch him play such an <UNK> role visible in the stands at the race track are such <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> edgar kennedy in a strangely <UNK> get up and a more characteristic mack <UNK> spitting <UNK> and doing his usual mindless <UNK> routine as a performer <UNK> was about as subtle as the movies he produced but you have to give the guy credit he knew what people liked these films were hugely popular in their day <UNK> performance doesn't add much to mabel at the wheel but he probably had to be on hand for the filming of this one to make sure his stars didn't kill each other
<START> i ordered the movie from korea because i was an extra in it and was interested to see how it turned out br br having watched it i can say that i am ashamed to have had any part of it i feel embarrassed not only for myself but for everyone else who had any part in the making of this mockery of british comedy br br from beginning to end the film is predictable tedious dull monotonous and cringe worthy to the point that on several occasions i actually looked away from the screen in <UNK> belief until you actually see the movie it is difficult to <UNK> how un romantic and un comedic a romantic comedy can be br br it's not only a bad story but a badly made film in one scene you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing the s a 's when to wipe across i will post details of this in the <UNK> section br br on the up side it did fill me with emotions disappointment rage <UNK>
<START> wow what a waste of acting talent my husband and i sat there both thinking this has to get better these actresses are too good to have wasted their time on this crap unattractive characters hackneyed script and <UNK> pacing make for a long two hours i actually couldn't hack it and left to do the <UNK> shopping cat <UNK> being more appealing than this film the husband stayed and confirmed that it didn't get better by the time buddy is killed you were wishing they all would get hit by a car and end their miserable lives it would be infinitely more entertaining beautiful scenery and costumes can't keep this one alive
<START> this is quite possibly the worst christmas film ever the plot is virtually non existent the acting affleck in particular is poor at best ben affleck fans will probably defend this film but deep down they must agree as far as i could gather the plot consisted of ben affleck a millionaire salesman is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood on doing this he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for christmas and that is it the film goes on and eventually he gets together with the daughter of the family blah blah blah
<START> a craven cowardly film director <UNK> shows <UNK> <UNK> rich houses but the male <UNK> is shown being <UNK> with the <UNK> thats all right then the <UNK> scientist investigating <UNK> is blown up in his car but he is rat faced <UNK> and doesn't look like a nice man so thats all right too the <UNK> owner of <UNK> house made their money by <UNK> <UNK> digging up <UNK> so it's okay to rob priceless art from them and hide it in a <UNK> in the <UNK> mountains the <UNK> kill his <UNK> and are <UNK> in his murder the moral <UNK> is sickening <UNK> looks for a hit film but doesn't have the guts to stand against the <UNK> of the <UNK> gang who <UNK> the <UNK> and unleashed another wave of <UNK> upon <UNK> he even <UNK> with the <UNK> son while making it disgusting shame on him for his <UNK>
<START> surprisingly enough does movie does have some redeeming quality in it when it moves toward its end for the other part this movie is being a really bad and lame one with a small budget <UNK> bad written script and everything that goes with it br br it's silly that with all the money going around in the christian circles they never can seem to get sufficient <UNK> to make a decent movie with i'm not a religious so i couldn't care less really but film making does some like a good tool to reach a new audience for <UNK> and getting people more interested and curious in reading the bible for instance in that regard these movies always seem like a wasted opportunity br br the low budget does really hurt the movie and brings it down it makes the movie laughable to watch with its effects and it just gives the overall movie a campy b movie like feeling br br but what's hurting this movie more is its writing the stuff that just happens in this movie is just insulting to the intelligence and then i'm not even complaining or talking about the religious aspects of the whole story the way the movie progresses is just so improbable and the people within this movie do such highly unlikely things that it's being insulting to its viewers br br i also hated how the movie was being like a soap opera at times seemed to me that they simply had a hard time turning this into a full length movie and they added in some characters and dramatic developments just to fill things up i just couldn't cared less really at times br br still it needs to be said that the movie gets more solid and steady toward its end when its story gets more focused on its essence still it remains predictable all but it prevented this movie from being a complete wreck to watch and as far as these type of movies are concerned there are far <UNK> one to watch out there though i don't think this movie will win over any new souls br br 4 10
<START> in mexico this movie was aired only in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> life is a true example about a good german and specially about a good man the conversations between <UNK> character and the nazi <UNK> are specially interesting a true <UNK> war two different germans both with faith in there believes <UNK> was a very complex person man freedom fighter boyfriend <UNK> and a great intellectual <UNK> <UNK> is outstanding as <UNK> i recommended this film a lot specially in this difficult times for the planet in mexico we don't know a lot about <UNK> <UNK> life and legacy this is a great work for rescue a forgotten hero
<START> this movie is just an excuse for the writer to make a film out of 2 failed scripts br br its characters are just an <UNK> of characters with clich√© tragic or comic attributes the sum total of which is neurotic dialog like only woody allen could write woman love this because its like looking in the mirror so they will enjoy this film probably br br this movies was not enjoyed by me however because there was no car chase and also the film didn't have any fights there was also no drug <UNK> or gang <UNK> not to mention a lack of snakes this film had no snakes not my cup of tea and maybe not yours <UNK> so think about what i have said before you find yourself watching this film br br unless of course you resemble a female have weight issues man issues enjoy sex and the city and ally <UNK> then this is meaningful for you
<START> fatal error is a really cool movie robert wagner antonio <UNK> jr <UNK> turner jason <UNK> malcolm stewart and david lewis are in the film the movie's cast all acted really well robert wagner played his role good the relationship between <UNK> jr and turner was a nice one there maybe a big age difference there but they are a unique couple the two actors really worked together rather well the music in the film is really good by ron <UNK> and fits the flick very well there is a bunch of stuff that happens in the movie which you don't know what is going on and what is going to happen next and this movie keeps you going from beginning to end if you like robert wagner antonio <UNK> jr and <UNK> turner then watch this excellent movie
<START> well this is an <UNK> <UNK> film with the rare exception <UNK> likes to entertain his films generally aren't deep but they are often entertaining enough my super ex girlfriend surprised me in that i laughed more than i thought i would uma thurman is just so grand and i love her portrayals i like luke wilson too and <UNK> wilson was a straight hoot never taking itself seriously the film is over the top and yet isn't very unique nor does it go where no one has gone before it's a nice rent though and probably an ok date movie especially if you have a headache and don't want to strain your brain it's <UNK> fun and there's nothing wrong with that when you strip away the super girl stuff you're left with a story about relationships and relationships gone bad it's a boy meets girl boy leaves girl thing and in the end the characters are looking for love not all of them take being dumped as well as they could a slice of life with a twist
<START> pierce brosnan the <UNK> but no longer james bond is an assassin he is very very good at what he does but he's getting old and tired greg <UNK> is really good as the straight and narrow business man now when the story opens the movie shows these two people in their separate lives then one night they are having drinks in a bar and they begin to talk then all of a sudden you find these two people getting drawn together during a series of events the story is excellent the acting is top notch and the humor is hilarious i never thought that pierce brosnan would be this funny but he really is and i must say this movie is a must see
<START> this movie makes several mistakes a few american actors in spain and the spanish actors speaking english the <UNK> english is ok but the way the acting is performed it makes it all quite annoying the dialog through the whole script is very weak it may have been a spanish script but translated <UNK> who knows and who cares i can only assume that these are famous spanish actors forced into the english language they may be good but not in this flop you will figure out the movie within the first 5 minutes thats how pathetic it is then the rest is just bad lots of waste of time lots of un necessary plots oh did i mention one of the <UNK> is in this
<START> well it's all been said about this movie and i hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said what's to be said but the thing is i have seen <UNK> of movies and i am working on writing reviews on all the movies that i've seen so i have to write something br br the acting is stupid it's truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash the nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be don't they realize that even rip offs can still be scary we don't see how the <UNK> is killed the dentist and his assistant made me feel they deserve to die you just don't sympathize with them and uncle tony in the garage dies in a way that could have been worked better we just hear him scream and we see nothing
<START> this made for television version of the legendary stand against hopeless odds is more objective more realistic than earlier filmed versions of the events though the one movie made after this went perhaps too far in <UNK> the figures of sam <UNK> <UNK> travis and <UNK> br br the focus here is on jim <UNK> played with sharp cynical <UNK> by james <UNK> who is apparently still alive at age 85 then <UNK> he made a comeback to acting after years away from the screen to do this part br br puerto <UNK> born <UNK> julia <UNK> gen santa <UNK> as no one since j carol <UNK> back in <UNK> had done however the mexican dictator is portrayed as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> uniforms have never been seen before or since he receives excellent advice from the european officers he has hired but convinced of his own <UNK> he does not <UNK> it br br alec baldwin is the one actor whose age is appropriate to the character he plays <UNK> william travis his portrayal is earnest he is almost in awe of the older men who share command with him br br the one jarring note was brian keith as <UNK> in a <UNK> cap and carrying ol' <UNK> he stumbles about as if he had <UNK> in from another movie with no conviction in the portrayal the character is reduced to a few stage conventions br br the script reveals some historical facts overlooked or <UNK> in earlier film versions we learn that jim <UNK> was in the person of santa <UNK> fighting his own brother in law the mexican soldiers performed poorly in part because they were armed with <UNK> left over from the <UNK> wars a generation earlier santa <UNK> likes a bargain <UNK> <UNK> explains the whole project of defending the former spanish mission as a <UNK> was <UNK> ill advised a fact explored in greater depth in the 2004 film the <UNK>
<START> before i start i should point out that i know the editor of this film we've never met but we belong to the same <UNK> those things which came before message boards and we have talked on the phone so i do have a bias here anyway br br somehow it's ironic how while the rat pack culture of the late 50's and early to mid 60's made a comeback in the mid 90's this movie from the son of one of the original rat pack and which was made in a similar fashion was a flop not only that it was a critical flop i believe peter <UNK> of rolling stone was the only one who did not savage this he gave it a mixed review as i recall and while i don't think this is the greatest film in the world and i am not a fan of the rat pack or cocktail culture i do think this is worth seeing br br for one thing this looks stylish and moves right along for another the core performances are all good richard <UNK> is surprisingly restrained here as the head gangster coming back from a <UNK> and has a <UNK> edge to him jeff goldblum goes back to the quietly ironic performances he gave in his pre blockbuster days like the big chill and while ellen <UNK> is only required to <UNK> in this movie she does it <UNK> admittedly it's not a great film the dialogue is mostly made up of <UNK> and a lot of them don't work like the whole <UNK> of ben speech and gabriel <UNK> and kyle <UNK> are awful here still i was entertained and if you like gangster films you might be too
<START> amateurish in the extreme camera work especially overwrought documentary camera <UNK> <UNK> spin around all the time br br the script is truly inane and the acting is even worse on top of that the story is disjointed and meandering with some <UNK> holes in logic at one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with suspected al <UNK> <UNK> and thus get an interview with <UNK> i found the story entirely unbelievable as a result of so many flaws the filmmaker lead role really portrays a <UNK> idiot frat boy the only item of interest really is that the filmmakers did in fact film on location it's truly a shame they wasted their opportunity to make something interesting br br who <UNK> this crap
<START> this had a good story it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool br br i've watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one i've seen in the two weeks br br jason <UNK> character was the best though br br even though it was small it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning br br this may be a romantic comedy and i don't like most but the writing direction performing sound design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool br br this film scored pretty high out of all the movie's i've seen lately and the rest were big budget or better <UNK> br br good job in writing
<START> this is one of the finest films to come out of hong <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that began with tsui <UNK> zu warriors of magic mountain tsui set a tone for the new <UNK> approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave jackie chan sammo hung wong <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc accepted from then on as a given namely the approach to such films <UNK> would need more than a touch of irony if not outright comedy burning paradise put a stop to all that and with a vengeance br br it's not that there isn't humor here but it is a purely human humor as with the aged <UNK> priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the <UNK> young prostitute while hiding in a <UNK> of straw but this is just as humans are not even <UNK> priests can be saints all the time br br when irony is at last introduced into the film it is the <UNK> possible <UNK> from the <UNK> of red <UNK> temple who is a study in pure <UNK> such as has never been recorded on film before he is the very incarnation of <UNK> satan from paradise lost better to rule in hell than serve in heaven and if he can't get to <UNK> hell soon enough he'll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule br br that's the <UNK> <UNK> the brutal violence of much of the imagery here it's not that the <UNK> just wants to kill people he wants them to despair to feel utterly hopeless to accept his <UNK> as all <UNK> reality thus there's a definite sense <UNK> the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself it has become all there is to the universe and the <UNK> claiming <UNK> of <UNK> power is in charge br br of course fortunately the film doesn't end there though there are <UNK> the human will to be just <UNK> human at last <UNK> if you want to know how see the film yet there is no doubt that in viewing this film we visit hell hopefully we do not witness our own <UNK> but we certainly feel <UNK> by the experience and somehow better for it over all
<START> <UNK> stuffed shirt <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> played by veteran character actor dean jagger in a rare lead role joins a group of <UNK> who want to find and destroy the secret technique of creating zombies <UNK> falls for the lovely claire <UNK> <UNK> blonde dorothy stone who uses the meek <UNK> to get <UNK> colleague <UNK> grayson the hopelessly wooden robert <UNK> to marry her furious over being used and <UNK> by claire <UNK> uses his knowledge of voodoo to get revenge sound exciting well it sure ain't for starters victor <UNK> static non direction lets the meandering and <UNK> talk ridden story <UNK> along at an excruciatingly slow pace worse yet <UNK> <UNK> fails to bring any tension atmosphere and momentum to the <UNK> tedious proceedings the mostly blah acting from a largely insipid cast doesn't help matters any only george cleveland as the <UNK> general <UNK> and e <UNK> warren as the <UNK> dr <UNK> manage to <UNK> things a bit with their welcome and refreshing hammy <UNK> the <UNK> stock film library score the painfully obvious <UNK> sets and the crude cinematography are pretty lousy and unimpressive as well in fact this feeble excuse for a fright feature is so crummy that not even the uncredited <UNK> staring eyes of the great bela lugosi can <UNK> the brain numbing boredom a <UNK> dull dud
<START> another in the they don't make em like that category this story of a family with some real <UNK> in its closet still qualifies as good clean sometimes over the top fun robert stack and dorothy malone are at their peak as the troubled hadley siblings and they really took the roles and ran with them malone won an oscar and stack was nominated in the supporting categories both <UNK> being <UNK> well deserved they <UNK> the somewhat bland leads neither bacall nor hudson could ever be called bad actors but they've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here it's kind of hard for me to accept rock hudson playing such a red blooded <UNK> as he does here but that's more of a personal bias than anything else but that doesn't take away from the movie's overall entertainment value which is considerable and this movie is extremely watchable if you're up some night and this movie comes on i'd say watch it it's well worth it
<START> the first one was different and funny this attempt should have never left the studio this movie does not make you laugh it is a weak attempt at gross out humor the movie picks out current and old movies to rip off this time the jokes seem used and overdone the audience that i saw it with only re acted to <UNK> dinner scene and was otherwise asleep
<START> the only thing i remember about this movie are two things first as a twelve year old even i thought it <UNK> second it was so bad that when mad magazine did a parody of it they quit after the first page and wrote a <UNK> at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely <UNK> it br br if you want to see great <UNK> comedies of this period try animal house it's so stupid and vulgar it <UNK> itself to high art another good selection would be <UNK> the classic with the late rodney <UNK> and bill murray before he became annoyingly charming with great lines like <UNK> keeper carl <UNK> correct me if i'm wrong sandy but if i kill all the <UNK> they'll lock me up and throw away the key
<START> out of br br yep dressed to kill is that kind of a movie it's like kalifornia but it's different remember that movie from 1993 which stars brad pitt as a serial killer who is welcomed by a couple of <UNK> in a trip to california as a buddy who might be a good company along the way when i watch a movie i always like not to know anything at all about the plot before watching it because the surprises may get even <UNK> that's how it was with kalifornia when i watched it last year for the first time i never realized it was a suspense movie so when i found out i was shocked and when the movie went on and on it got even better and i was at the edge of my seat almost kissing my <UNK> so close i was to it so we're discussing about dressed to kill right before i watched this movie today i've only watched 2 others movies from brian de palma so i can say i don't really know that well his works but can tell from <UNK> that these 2 movies for me were as great as they could be carrie 1976 and mission impossible 1996 when i watched carrie on the tv i was really that desperate to get a dvd copy and i can tell this movie is great mission impossible also and today i watched a third movie from <UNK> br br well dressed to kill is a movie like kalifornia when the movie goes on it goes completely different than what you'd expect i was watching very curious the scene of the museum where dickinson follows the mysterious man to his cab and they end together in an apartment room you may guess what may have happened there but when the movie reached the scene of the elevator the movie went completely on a different path i was watching the rest of the movie and i really liked it however there are some low points some characters in the movie are completely silent take for example the mysterious man from the museum scene i was always hoping that he could say something but he never did this was totally ridiculous and was with no doubt something that made me change my mind by not accepting this movie as at least almost something as a masterpiece even in the cab scene where dickinson tries to apologize because of what happened in the museum the completely silent man grabs her pulls her inside the cab and they start kissing each other you know it reminded me of the mexican tv series of the 70's el <UNK> del 8 where some characters are completely silent getting past these low points of the movie it is actually a great movie considering the suspense the characters and the plot dennis <UNK> is cool as detective <UNK> reminded me of him as capt <UNK> <UNK> in die hard 2 1990 where he plays almost the same kind of character br br well <UNK> this review the ending of dressed to kill is the same ending as it is in carrie i don't know if i really liked that because i hate <UNK> i understand that carrie is a movie from <UNK> so it's not actually an imitation because after all it was his idea but it turned to be a repetitive idea in dressed to kill so <UNK> could have done something different instead of showing nancy allen waking up from a bad dream the same way it happens to amy irving at the ending scene of carrie this was of course with no doubt another low point but if you get past this you will find that dressed to kill is a really good movie and i assure you that it's not by any means a waste of time watching it
<START> very <UNK> authority with little responsibility and only a desire to keep his her name clean check a veteran cop that has bad relationship with his family check mafia guys that while criminals want to do something good vigilante style check a <UNK> and loyal mafia guy not <UNK> to kill people to make an example check <UNK> methods being less effective than the mafia guy's brutal yet very effective methods check a corrupt cop <UNK> the authority the criminals and the police together check br br slow motion and or jerky frame rates for showing what the actor's reaction can't check a serial killer whose background is explained in far too much detail <UNK> using childhood abuse as the reason for everything check a child spree killer that is very very non menacing check <UNK> of the veteran <UNK> moral values not being what the killer deserves in the movie's and the majority of characters' opinion check morally ambiguous and predictable ending thanks to the <UNK> and the good veteran <UNK> coming to terms he should submit to the vigilante attitude of the majority of the characters check br br recently saw this on tv and decided to endure it because it had dennis hopper in it and i could not sleep check realized that was a mistake and should just have <UNK> at the ceiling check
<START> easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays it has been seriously let down here shoddy direction <UNK> studio work and <UNK> performances spoil a fine tragedy br br in the town of <UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> have been <UNK> for centuries but tragedy is <UNK> when romeo patrick <UNK> a <UNK> falls in love with juliet rebecca <UNK> a <UNK> bloodshed soon <UNK> br br the studio work especially in daytime scenes seriously <UNK> the energy of the play it's a story that with it's energy deserves to be shot <UNK> coupled with this the costumes are hideous with too many <UNK> and ludicrous <UNK> the stage fighting looks horrendous with far too much <UNK> and running around to be engaging br br patrick <UNK> is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo he manages the character's intensity when the plot gets going but his <UNK> accent and bland often <UNK> eyes limit his range it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo rebecca <UNK> is too youthful to be a good juliet she captures the character's <UNK> but a little more <UNK> would have been welcome br br the supporting roles don't fare much better joseph <UNK> <UNK> laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut anthony <UNK> <UNK> belongs on stage and not on camera he <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and looks rather ridiculous as a result alan <UNK> <UNK> his role has virtually no presence as <UNK> he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years but that isn't in evidence here the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence <UNK> fails to give the part any authority on camera only micheal <UNK> in probably his best role in this series comes out of this with any dignity his <UNK> is well played and a joy to watch br br see one of the other versions of this story instead
<START> i remember having a pretty low regard for a venture like this when it was first released james not jim belushi a hammy kid actress and a cheesy title in a john hughes formula you couldn't have paid me to see it 15 years ago but i got caught up watching it while wasting away a sunday afternoon and it hits me on a couple of levels the fairy tale part pretty woman part reverse pretty woman the very vulnerable elizabeth <UNK> in miracle on <UNK> street like performance by kelly lynch the <UNK> over all it gently pulls some very nice strings it's pretty hard not to fall into the story develop a crush on kelly lynch identify with james belushi dislike the stiff bad guy boyfriend and laugh at the <UNK> sue lines has all the ups and downs with a happy ending and the kind of message you want to hear go ahead waste your time on this movie it's worth it
<START> no words can describe my utter hatred for this appalling rendition of the btk killer rating this film one out of ten <UNK> this truly disastrous excuse for a film from start to finish there was not one single highlight the entire thing was <UNK> put together the script acting plot lighting direction acting factual information acting just to name a few a number of scenes are literally laugh out loud funny for the atrocious way in which the entire thing is put together this review may seem like an <UNK> and <UNK> attack on a low budget film but this is not the case just thinking about the movie i have just seen makes my blood start to <UNK> how this film was ever granted rights for production i will never know i am almost tempted to actually recommend btk because it is truly a stand out in regards to how pathetic and <UNK> awful it is i can honestly say in all my years of film going this is the worst movie ever i wasted over an hour of my life on this useless garbage and would gladly have jumped off the nearest building beforehand had i known what i was in for zero out of ten
<START> clearly rips off <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ring 1998 and <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> <UNK> dark water 2002 with hints of <UNK> on the grudge 2000 but <UNK> done gore a green corpse with red eyes weak story and a weak theme i find it very difficult to find a picture message scary there were two moments in this film that made me <UNK> both involving an unexpected hand and after <UNK> another miike takashi one this one from 1999 had me <UNK> all over for hours after seeing it and all of the films this steals from were actually scary i can't see this film as anything other than a sell out to the western popularity of the big japanese horror films two out of ten
<START> mystery men is one of those movies that gets funnier over time there is a naive innocence and <UNK> to the characters it has become part of our family culture and we quote the characters often it is my favorite film of the last two years my kids are 13 and 11 and we all three love this film great acting and comedy we love galaxy quest and monty python flicks too okay we're not talking intellectual here just family bonding
<START> ghost of <UNK> hollow appears to take place in a <UNK> <UNK> an era long gone by where the biggest sin a kid could commit would be in <UNK> the law and getting a traffic ticket it opens with a young female auto fanatic getting the business from her arch rival who <UNK> her into a car race that's about it for the drag racing this b flick is mostly concerned with rock <UNK> roll man the folks at american international were obviously fond of decent square teens who liked to party and yet didn't mind an adult <UNK> there are a few amusing double <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> kid we thought we'd come out for some fresh air dad where did you think you'd find it down her throat but the ghost is a little late in arriving brief at <UNK> minutes the movie <UNK> us with a climactic car race that actually takes place off screen and a pre scooby doo <UNK> <UNK> which makes no sense however for nostalgia buffs some mindless fun from
<START> holly <UNK> the issue of child <UNK> that is rampant all over the world some 2 million children are <UNK> every year and does so <UNK> and without manipulation a tall order that the team at <UNK> films does with great success american actor ron <UNK> stars in the film alongside newcomer <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> actress who plays holly and together they bring to screen what is <UNK> to the people at the notorious <UNK> <UNK> district in cambodia although it <UNK> a heavy topic the film holds on to moments of laughter and hope as we get to know the characters up close keeping the two hour film from being one that is too difficult to watch i am glad a film like this is bringing the world's attention to the problem child prostitution needs to be stopped and this is a very good first step it's great and a film everyone must see
<START> i commented on this when it first <UNK> and gave it a thumbs in the middle review <UNK> that i'd give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode i've seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in june 2006 and as a <UNK> batman fanatic i can say without <UNK> this show is utter crap br br <UNK> wrong with it everything getting past just the lousy animation and design the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories br br and for god's sake is it just me or is the joker in every episode is <UNK> that much of a revolving door justice system or again is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains see no character development above br br and to make matters worse every single joker tale is the same 3 part formula br br 1 joker <UNK> people br br 2 joker sets out to gas the whole city br br 3 batman saves the day br br <UNK> br br there was one episode i saw that wasn't a joker story the title escapes me but the villain was that <UNK> <UNK> the think thank <UNK> episode with the <UNK> show that was the single worst batman story i've ever seen heard or read yes worse than i've got batman in my basement br br i can't really say what i feel this show is because it's probably against the <UNK> but it starts with b and <UNK> with <UNK> thank goodness for the existence of the <UNK> <UNK> etc era of bat entertainment back from the fox and kids wb days stuff that good and i should have known this just couldn't possibly have lasted forever unfortunately
<START> this may be the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical ever even the music has been destroyed attenborough knows nothing about theater almost every shot and moment ring false i will say though that it is almost bad enough to be funny br br the <UNK> are remarkably dated i can not for the life of me understand what is meant <UNK> by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where a chorus line is playing are we to think that these people are <UNK> for a chorus line which contains the stories about the people who are <UNK> oh no the show is <UNK> on itself br br i saw the original production and have listened to the album hundreds of times why oh why did they do this
<START> the sarah silverman program is better than those other shows no laugh tracks no painful jokes just a program the sarah silverman program if you're like me and you love comedy this is probably a show for you br br sarah silverman brings out there funny and right here funny to the table with ease a mix of different styles which makes for its own br br this program isn't something you want to start a compare war with seeing as how it has absolutely nothing to do with them other shows this show is its own <UNK> and i think most comedy heads will like it just fine br br go watch and see
<START> i had to see this gem twice to really appreciate all of it when a widowed father of two <UNK> his two <UNK> sleep with a shocking revelation they are torn between believing him and not as the horrifying events of this tale unfold we learn a lot about the father about his two sons and about their <UNK> with shocking twist after shocking twist this film never allows for a <UNK> in the plot bill paxton plays the father but the most notable performances are that of his older son <UNK> played by matthew <UNK> and his younger son adam played by jeremy <UNK> this is one of the best thrillers that i have seen in a while and you will want to watch this a few times to appreciate every intricate aspect of the plot i give this film a 9 10
<START> spoiler below but read on or you'll never know the horrible fate that <UNK> all <UNK> to rent <UNK> br br on a <UNK> night in a remote research laboratory a major medical breakthrough is about to have deadly results a chemical compound that was created to hunt and destroy deadly cancer cells has <UNK> from the <UNK> waste <UNK> system into the <UNK> basement now the <UNK> involved in the laboratory experiment upstairs are not the only rats in the facility that will become the altered species professor <UNK> a leading bio <UNK> has just determined that the addition of a new <UNK> now <UNK> his hunt and destroy <UNK> to <UNK> for the length of time necessary to <UNK> deadly cancer <UNK> when three varying degrees of the new mixture are <UNK> to three different rats and the rest <UNK> down the <UNK> waste <UNK> sink shocking side effects result in a night of terror right br br seriously this is probably the worst film i've seen this year everything about it screams low budget from the horrendous acting to the special effects which are some of the worst i've ever seen the characters are clich√©d morons and act in stupid predictable ways walking down dark <UNK> alone looking for a cat <UNK> and falling so the rats can catch up with them <UNK> themselves up in a small room etc br br while some films are cheaply made this film really takes the cake every possible corner is cut everything from <UNK> earlier shots filming the lab <UNK> from different angles to make it look bigger that reminds me why were only two guys working in this <UNK> massive building to music and special effects that could be done on a children's <UNK> pc br br that brings me to the worst aspect of this steaming pile of dung the special effects just horrendous the computer generated rats look so fake and stand out in every scene so even the dumbest of film buffs could see they are computer generated and that giant rat suit oh my god seriously are we supposed to believe that freaking <UNK> baby is a monster just pitiful on the better side some of the gore looks pretty cool especially considering the budget br br the actors all suck no one involved with the production cared or knew what they were doing i've wasted enough time with review just take my advice it's garbage 1 10 br br about the dvd the transfer sucks the audio is passable and there's a commentary track on the <UNK> by the director and two of his friends who say they had absolutely nothing to do with making the film but were there to ask questions and make comments all three of these sub human <UNK> <UNK> are so incredibly stupid that they should be <UNK> before they can harm themselves or others i don't want to waste any more of you kind <UNK> time or mine for i am starting to remember more than i want to about this film dvd rating 1 10
<START> in the 1930s studios would use short films like this one sort of as testing grounds for new actors given their relative ease of production in comparison with full length feature films so it's interesting that this one should star shirley temple who had long since established herself as the most famous child star of all time then again she probably wasn't the one being tested i would imagine that would have been frank <UNK> jr who played <UNK> brother sonny in the movie and delivered a <UNK> less impressive performance then again a 9 year old shirley temple was probably not an easy act to <UNK> br br the film opens with an unimpressive sight gag involving a <UNK> ceiling which i suppose was designed to have shirley temple give a <UNK> look at the ceiling illustrate the working class status of the family in the movie and provide a clean transition into the next scene which features shirley <UNK> <UNK> in the rain br br it's <UNK> birthday and his father makes occasional and <UNK> <UNK> efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give sonny a dog that he really wants for himself but sonny is afraid of dogs because he was bitten by one once and has been <UNK> out ever since it's curious that when his father insists on getting a dog sonny decides to run away from home rather than have a dog in the house and as he is running away with no destination in sight it's also curious that the movie illustrates what seems to be an indifference to homeless people that surpasses even the astounding indifference that exists today br br sonny passes a man cooking bacon in an iron <UNK> at the side of the train tracks right after a train flew by which given how close to the tracks he was you would think would have blown the guy right off the tracks but no matter after sonny gives up on sharing breakfast due to the sour stare that his <UNK> smile receives from the guy he continues on and the homeless guy disappears from the movie it's interesting to consider what a longer film would have done because this one leaves this poor guy as a loose end br br not that that matters sonny soon hears a dog whining underneath a <UNK> as he passes over it and jumps down to find a dog covered in <UNK> it might seem trite that he immediately takes the dog up and <UNK> it since he just left home because of his fear of dogs but it seemed to me that he just needed to be reminded not of his power over dogs but of their lack of power over him as soon as he saw a dog in need he <UNK> his fear br br hey if that's all it takes all i have to do is find a helpless spider and i'm set br br it's a very convenient movie in which everything works out exactly as it is supposed to but it's cute enough and enjoyable enough and short enough as it were to still be a fun movie we already don't expect an epic plot in a 19 minute film but <UNK> my <UNK> still packs in a substantial amount of story and character development in its short running time and it also features a fight scene at the end of the movie that must have made charlie chaplin proud i am hardly an expert of shirley <UNK> films but it's not hard to see how she became the most famous child star of all time
<START> after disney's witty live action george of the jungle i had high hopes for this flick major disappointment thread bare plot bad acting bad visual effects this film relied on lame one liners idiotic and pointless product placement and the <UNK> most annoying side kick in that gadget car thing i took two young kids to see it and they where bored out of their mind the only laugh received from this movie was bad <UNK> of when needing a laugh show a guy getting it in the <UNK>
<START> i've read most of the comments on this movie i have seen this movie and the whole prophecy series many times with family members of all ages we all enjoyed and it just made us <UNK> on what we already knew from reading and studying the bible about the rapture and end times no one got scared or traumatized like i have read on some <UNK> the movie is just based on biblical facts i have seen a lot of end time movies <UNK> <UNK> and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting bible truths it may not have a lot of great special effects like todays movies but i believe it is a good witnessing tool this movie and its prophecy series can be seen free at this website <UNK> com and judge for yourself <UNK> to all
<START> i really liked this movie despite one scene that was pretty bad the one when samantha and nick are <UNK> in the hotel the story is so cool and can't wait to read the book bravo for the super station
<START> director f w <UNK> wisely stuck with the silent film medium he knew so well to cover this story of native <UNK> life in the south <UNK> the documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie the landscapes are beautiful and the daily life activities of the <UNK> are interesting to watch the film loses momentum though when it begins to concentrate more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers the storyline just never gets that interesting despite being handled well by <UNK> won an academy award for best cinematography although the award probably should have been for best scenery you can't really credit the <UNK> for getting to shoot in such a beautiful location
<START> have i seen a worse movie perhaps only <UNK> the hands of fate dragged more than dukes i had more fun <UNK> at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point let's touch on a few br br there was a noticeable script death and <UNK> when <UNK> is talking to the dukes and they don't respond he <UNK> and moves on since neither the <UNK> or scott know what he's talking about nor do we it was like the engine died and was <UNK> br br the few times the general lee flew through the air weren't even that exciting nothing i haven't seen on the tv series br br very little chemistry between <UNK> and scott the best part was when bo is upset at luke for stealing the girl he liked the only reason this works is that the script actually <UNK> it although roughly the rest of the time it seems distant and forced br br <UNK> william scott's awful horrendous accent or lack thereof br br i hated willie <UNK> performance were bad jokes supposed to be endearing i wanted him to disappear br br jessica simpson comes across <UNK> on the big screen she actually felt like one of the better actors in the film that's telling you how horrible this movie is she's a <UNK> br br during the climax of the film i was rooting for boss <UNK> and the bad guys to <UNK> all of hazzard county starting with willie nelson and his <UNK> a nuclear bomb would have <UNK> br br this is not meant to be a coherent <UNK> of the film but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a truly heartwarming film br br if only we could <UNK> and start over
<START> to <UNK> this movie without a real plot this movie consists of 80 minutes of deranged characters either drinking or making bad jokes the music is just awful the humor isn't funny and all the female characters <UNK> idiots or total <UNK> it seems to me that the movie has actually been written by a 14 year old boy who thinks that drinking is cool women are designed to please men and all that <UNK> that view are <UNK> also the movie has nothing to do with the original american pie movies other than a few names and mr <UNK> who is a minor character in this one the only good thing about this movie are the nice looking girls don't watch this movie and don't be fooled by the 5 4 rating because it obviously overrated and doesn't deserve anything above 2
<START> made only ten years after the actual events and set in the <UNK> under the <UNK> <UNK> film is wholly gripping it <UNK> of <UNK> death awaiting the <UNK> of world war haven't seen this in over three decades but it remains strong in my visual and emotional memory the characters seem to be waiting to be <UNK> up in their cave <UNK> bit of dialog between two <UNK> does god exist if he did we wouldn't shame this is not more readily available for <UNK> or purchase because it would be interesting to view and compare this film with the documentary about <UNK> <UNK> im <UNK> <UNK> aka blind spot hitler's secretary and downfall with bruno <UNK>
<START> here's the good news first spirit is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release the artwork and effects are revolutionary and i recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alone br br and now for the bad news i really mean it when i say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it you may remember that spirit got badly <UNK> by <UNK> and <UNK> last summer the first person who <UNK> that it was because disney is more well established and had better advertising can write me a four page long <UNK> entitled why <UNK> and <UNK> script didn't stink br br for all the incredible new animation technology on display in spirit the story is almost astonishingly dull there is a lesson here and needless to say it doesn't just apply to animated movies you can have the most mind blowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal but if your story is boring and more importantly we don't care about your characters it's bad film making simple as that the animation is still mind blowing i just can't wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it
<START> richard widmark is a <UNK> character in this movie he is a professional <UNK> he's been in prison three times yet at the beginning of the film he tries to make it four thelma ritter is a busy body selling information to almost everybody jean peters is amazing as the girl <UNK> by widmark br br this is a period piece during the mccarthy era where the red scare ruled the politics and is worked into this plot quite nicely what is unusual about this film is that peters ritter are both victims of violent <UNK> in an era where women were seldom more than sex objects in films this is what makes this film noir as women often got different roles in this type of film br br the film is only <UNK> minutes long and was obviously made by fox as the under card for double features in the theater the sets show it is a limited budget film the script made j edgar hoover mad because <UNK> is given short <UNK> hoover wanted it changed br br instead it became a b under card picture that was a sleeper hit in 1953 the script acting in it are better than other big features were that year
<START> the most bizarre of the cinematic sub genres is the so called the great ladies of the grand <UNK> camp horror films which combined over the top melodrama with gothic thrills and always starred by seasoned and almost forgotten actress from hollywood golden age in <UNK> roles of either long suffering victims or <UNK> evil <UNK> this genre provided them with an unusual acting showcase that allowed <UNK> their stuff on the screen once again and win new generations of fans at expense of their glamorous images from yesterday br br what's the matter with helen is the last drop of this sub genre with stunning performances of both debbie reynolds and shelley winters as the troubled mothers of two convicted criminals who run away from their past to the sunny california in the 1930s to open a talent school to milk out the eagerly mothers who want their daughters to be the next shirley temple in california debbie gets happiness <UNK> tango tap dancing and a new love interest dennis weaver meanwhile shelley gets <UNK> with horrible flashbacks menacing anonymous calls menacing strangers menacing <UNK> <UNK> as a radio <UNK> cute little <UNK> and an unfortunate encounter with an electric fan <UNK> br br the sloppy script penned by henry farrell the man who started all this genre with whatever happened to baby jane along with master director robert <UNK> joan crawford and bette davis is full of plot holes red herrings and wasted opportunities that could had made this movie great the underlying themes of twisted <UNK> with debbie and <UNK> characters as failed mothers and the overbearing <UNK> of the child stars and obsessive female bonding debbie and shelley relationship and the fact that the few male characters of this movie are either sinister or sleazy even dennis weaver dream boat <UNK> are wasted instead we get debbie reynolds musicals <UNK> and dancing <UNK> although fun to watch take too much screen time of what is supposedly to be a psychological <UNK> but still this movie is highly entertaining the two stars and curtis <UNK> stylish direction easily <UNK> its flaws the movie recreation of the 1930's is colorful and elegant look at <UNK> clothes made with a very tight budget the increasing atmosphere of madness and <UNK> is genuinely creepy with a shocking finale that will haunt you for days and you wouldn't easily forget that silly <UNK> <UNK> song that runs through the movie either and seeing an increasingly mad shelley winters screw every one of debbie <UNK> chances at happiness is a hoot to watch br br 8 out of 10
<START> i don't care how many bad reviews purple rain gets this movie rocks excellent movie has it all great music prince of coarse romance and drama br br this is really a very sad movie very moving i don't want to say to much more i m not into giving away the plot but i will say this the film is very realistic there are so many romantic relationships that go through these problems so many <UNK> <UNK> to the one depicted in the film i see this as being very realistic and being so real makes the movie that much more moving my generation loved this movie growing up so many of us loved prince and there is alot to relate to for any teenager who has gone through <UNK> problems br br that said it's <UNK> not just a movie for teens id <UNK> it to all age groups and it's not all so dark the movie has some great music band performance scenes and sexy fun scenes between prince and <UNK>
<START> what a fantastic premise a movie about the berlin <UNK> it should have it all tragedy suspense <UNK> rivals <UNK> <UNK> and tough us pilots love and tears what we've got is a film with none of the above <UNK> <UNK> tries to <UNK> john wayne or so but he fails miserably he acts so wooden that at any given moment he should crack he tries to play the tough guy instead of being a tough guy why would <UNK> <UNK> character fall in love with him cause they were throwing stones in a lake cause he brings her coal <UNK> the <UNK> are very very well done too much though the hundreds or so planes over berlin look like an attack fighter <UNK> <UNK> rather than an <UNK> <UNK> ¬ñ as it actually was interestingly enough the white house the <UNK> and general <UNK> d <UNK> office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set notice the same <UNK> hanging deep down the windows as if a protective shield against nuclear <UNK> why is almost every scene inside dark and dusty by the way general <UNK> d clay comes across as a small time insecure <UNK> general who <UNK> trust in his own noble idea the <UNK> he was very much the opposite so you combine all those individual <UNK> and the result is a film with that builds toward no passion no suspense and no historic accuracy sad it started out so <UNK>
<START> recently when i was shopping i saw the box set of <UNK> gothic and i thought 'i remember that ' i used to set my alarm to get back up watch this when it was on <UNK> 4 in 1996 at 1 <UNK> i was 14 i remember it mostly because it was really scary and weird no person could ever be as frightening as lucas buck with a b no one ever was anyway br br what annoyed me though was they did the same thing to the box set as when on tv episodes in funny order i kept thinking when does dr matt leave they made it so confusing br br however this is not the writers producers or directors fault its tv people in background the money makers they still do the same just look at shows like <UNK> and <UNK> they don't like originality in studios br br to finish if you've not seen this and you call yourself a sci fi fantasy horror supernatural drama fan you must they even said the same in <UNK> when reviewing the box set
<START> we watched this on the wonderful world of disney on abc last night and i came to the conclusion that things must be <UNK> there at the mouse than usual br br since this movie only runs <UNK> minutes and they had to pad it out to 2 hours of broadcast television time they had and i'm not making this up commercial breaks that lasted 6 to 7 minutes and during these commercial breaks they had another <UNK> in the <UNK> of a tv show <UNK> by the oh so annoying kelly <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> the magical wonders of cinderella 2 dreams come true br br again and again break after break disney took time out of the real movie to tell us the loyal viewers that we needed to get a copy of the sequel thank you disney for doing us the service of creating a sequel to your beloved gem of a movie br br anyway all this <UNK> and cash register <UNK> made it a difficult task to get into the actual movie of cinderella because by the time the commercials were over i had forgotten where the story had left off br br but of course the original cinderella still maintains its magic and the story is still a good one though we've all seen it countless times it's a shame they had to <UNK> it with all the marketing for what looks to be a lame follow up
<START> this is the french and <UNK> doing what they do best it's quirky visually inventive <UNK> and emotionally challenging storytelling director <UNK> van <UNK> takes us into the world of georges a <UNK> syndrome <UNK> and his quest for a meaningful relationship with someone just anyone this is not done in a <UNK> way but with a great sense of fun and also honesty <UNK> interplay with corporate management guru harry is <UNK> handled shifting from comedy to tragedy back to comedy again with breathtaking ease br br the <UNK> day puts similar hollywood fare like barry <UNK> oscar winning rain man or robert <UNK> forrest <UNK> well and truly in the <UNK> at times it evokes the humour of <UNK> <UNK> one flew over the <UNK> nest with shades of dennis potter thrown in for good measure br br as the emotionally <UNK> and desperately lonely <UNK> harry daniel <UNK> turns in yet another sublime performance but it is matched by the brilliant <UNK> <UNK> as georges it's a movie with uniformly strong performances and so many memorable set pieces the shoe shop scene car <UNK> scene <UNK> dance to <UNK> <UNK> he knows me ' the <UNK> scene the fireworks scene if you haven't seen it there's only one thing to do just rent it or attend a screening at a retro cinema near you and see what you've been missing better still buy this movie sheer genius
<START> the acting fantastic the story amazing the script wonderful br br just a few ways to describe this movie yes it's slow and it has mostly talking but the whole story of all of their lives and how it's told with the flashbacks thrown in and out makes you want to listen to every little thing to learn more about this haunting and tragic story i myself am reading the book that the movie is based off of and it has shown me even more light into this story and answers some questions that were left unanswered in the movie i'm also to read the <UNK> song which is the <UNK> half of the <UNK> story this movie made me think so much about the phrase <UNK> into the other side of the looking glass you hear a song in the movie called gary <UNK> eyes which is by a punk band that wrote a song about what it'd be like to have gary <UNK> eyes which is one of the things gary gave as a transplant when he died and as you listen to it which is after the last time <UNK> ever sees gary you look at the whole situation a little differently if you were to only here the song itself this movie opened my eyes in that way and in many others i recommend this movie and the book very very much
<START> de <UNK> is a very good film the great plot comes from the novel by tim <UNK> who also adapted this story for the screen some really top class acting not only by van <UNK> but especially by marcel <UNK> who mostly did tv work prior to his performance of <UNK> van de <UNK> the film seems to kick of as a thriller and sets an excellent mood then we start to learn about <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> van de <UNK> and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash back structure which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character driven drama of the movie in the end this all <UNK> into an emotional ending that will grab audiences by their throats make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie a must see especially if you liked <UNK> the <UNK> original screen adaptation
<START> about three minutes into this thing i started fast <UNK> <UNK> only during the nudity why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women in ten minutes i was done and wishing i could get my money back from the rental store the people who write these movies should be <UNK> by the mpaa come on writers the bad guys always get into the car with the bomb <UNK> by the good guy's remote control that's the way its been done since the days of the <UNK> empire also to add insult to injury the twist at the end was so formulaic that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years burt reynolds was fine but he should concentrate on real movies br br this movie is just a waste of time run away run away
<START> since most <UNK> of this film are of <UNK> seen <UNK> ago i'd like to add a more recent one the film <UNK> with stock footage of b <UNK> bombing germany the film <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> captain <UNK> character and his <UNK> running for cover while making their way to hitler's <UNK> <UNK> once inside they are <UNK> by <UNK> staff <UNK> the film then <UNK> to one of many <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> giving a decent impression of <UNK> hitler <UNK> his <UNK> to ultimate victory while <UNK> character is shown as slowly coming to realize the <UNK> <UNK> are caught up in a fantasy world some non <UNK> <UNK> are depicted most notable being the <UNK> of the subway system to prevent a russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the <UNK> <UNK> and his family's difficulty in surviving this film <UNK> from a number of detail inaccuracies that a german film made only 10 year's after ww2 should not have included the actor portraying <UNK> willy <UNK> <UNK> the same uniform as hitler including arm eagle <UNK> wore a brown nazi party uniform with <UNK> <UNK> the ss <UNK> wear german army <UNK> the well documented scene of hitler <UNK> the iron cross to boy's of the hitler youth is shown as having taken place inside the <UNK> it was done outside in the <UNK> and lastly hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as a <UNK> <UNK> model <UNK> most <UNK> agree it was a <UNK> <UNK> some <UNK> of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable this bit is shown as a <UNK> skit with a <UNK> wounded soldier his arm in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stepping to music while a nurse does a combination <UNK> belly dance all by <UNK> this is actually embarrassing to watch the most incredible bit is when <UNK> captain <UNK> <UNK> an audience alone with <UNK> hitler hitler is shown as <UNK> on a wall <UNK> drugged and delirious when <UNK> character <UNK> to question him hitler <UNK> screaming which <UNK> in a ss guard who <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character in the back with a <UNK> this <UNK> scene is not based on any true historic account <UNK> character is then <UNK> off to die in a <UNK> while hitler <UNK> his own ending hitler's farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is off screen the final <UNK> of the movie show hitler's funeral <UNK> smoke slowly <UNK> into a ghostly image of the face of the dead <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this film is more <UNK> than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent film's such as the 1973 remake hitler the last 10 day's or the german film downfall der <UNK> if they wish a more true <UNK> of this dramatic story these last two film's are based on first person <UNK> <UNK> with hitler the last 10 day's being <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> autobiography as a staff officer in the <UNK> <UNK> and downfall being done from hitler's <UNK> <UNK> the screen play for der <UNK> <UNK> is taken from american <UNK> war <UNK> trial judge michael <UNK> book ten day's to die which is more a <UNK> of <UNK> many obviously <UNK> than <UNK> history it is surprising that hugh <UNK> <UNK> account the last day's of hitler was never made into a film
<START> i was forced to watch this whole series of films as a young child and i was told they were real talk about child abuse i would have been less frightened of dracula or frankenstein this series is only good for people who believe in this <UNK> and who want to <UNK> their children into believing the same besides the obvious issues associated with <UNK> and <UNK> there's also the bad acting bad writing and bad special effects they are just all around terrible terrible movies yes believable and horrifying to a kid but i can't imagine a grown up buying into this <UNK> although i must say that i would be interested in seeing them today as an adult they might have a certain midnight cult movie feel to them
<START> after the <UNK> of the <UNK> it was unlikely that a further outing for hanzo would be able to do any better and this doesn't <UNK> that expectation but it is a fine film and sits neatly in between the fun but messy first chapter and the terrific second in terms of quality and general entertainment the screenplay comes from <UNK> <UNK> and has some parallels with the <UNK> as well as the expected hi <UNK> of a hanzo film but the film rings nice little changes on the formula by <UNK> up the character driven humour as well as giving the film a <UNK> <UNK> edge the film opens with <UNK> <UNK> scared by a ghost and typically he decides straight away that he needs to have <UNK> knowledge of this ghost it turns out that the ghost is serving as a guard for a <UNK> of stolen <UNK> and from this set up unfolds a story of <UNK> corruption and <UNK> with expected violent and sleazy results <UNK> <UNK> is terrific as expected as hanzo coming across effortlessly as a deadly fighter and sexual force of nature he is equally good in the moments of knowing humour and likable almost an ordinary gentleman in moments of drama it is a beautifully rounded performance filled with social conscience and a touching edge of personal feeling the expected comedy comes off fine as well his moments with snake <UNK> are perhaps the most amusing of the series whilst his interactions with his servants are <UNK> entertaining as ever though neatly laden throughout with nice moments a fair amount of action and a little sleaze the film does lose a little from a relatively restrained approach there are shades of both prior films the plotting pace and <UNK> recall the <UNK> and when the film aims for sleaze it does very well with a <UNK> handled and <UNK> early <UNK> sequence equally though director <UNK> <UNK> presents potentially sleazy scenes in a more experimental way as per <UNK> <UNK> less well handled work in sword of justice with consequences sometimes very nice as with a man playing a tune on the <UNK> with close ups of his fingers <UNK> at the strings as <UNK> to him hanzo <UNK> his wife and sometimes a bit weak as with an orgy that is reduced to a nudity free psychedelic <UNK> of limbs in motion that just looks confusing the nudity and bloodshed is generally <UNK> which is a pity though there is a little of both a stronger approach would have worked better it is definitely the sort of film where trashy and <UNK> nudity and violence are most appropriate but even with less in the way of exploitative goods this is still thoroughly entertaining stuff the predictable moments are <UNK> with <UNK> and there is more than enough intrigue and excitement even some effective surprises to go around its a film for the fans really playing off the work laid down in the previous <UNK> and working <UNK> if not spectacularly with it altogether a near wholly <UNK> if mildly flawed end to a delightful trilogy the second best of them and well worth a watch for <UNK> of such things
<START> all i have to say is if you don't like it then there is something wrong with you plus jessica is just all kinds of hot the only reason you may not like it is because it is set in the future where seattle has gone to hell that and you my not like it cause the future they show could very well happen
<START> i'm a huge steven seagal fan hell i probably <UNK> as much as he does although i don't have the street <UNK> to sport the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> having stated my own bias and affection for america's favorite <UNK> stage and screen hero it is with a heavy heart that i must <UNK> this to be his worst movie ever i'm not sure he could make a movie any worse than this br br in his defense the major problems with this film seem to occur in post production it's painfully obvious that this movie was supposed to have a different storyline that results in <UNK> <UNK> in which <UNK> voice doesn't nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice the editing is <UNK> and overall this starts bad gets even worse and by the end you'll wish you had <UNK> the da <UNK> code instead yes it's that bad br br after this i don't know what to expect from steve my friends still laugh at me for listening to his <UNK> is it time i start checking out some of the van damme direct to dvd nutty <UNK> if you are tempted to watch this movie rip your <UNK> out and <UNK> them down the toilet a lifetime of darkness is better than <UNK> minutes of this
<START> this film has an interesting plot but the acting is quite bad and the script is poor i was very disappointed the moral dilemma faced by the main character is an intriguing one but due to poor writing and casting this potentially winning premise is <UNK> 2 of the 4 other people in the theater left after about 45 minutes and the other 2 were laughing at how bad the film was i stuck it out to the end but i must admit i played <UNK> on my cell phone to make the last 30 minutes bearable
<START> this reminded me of spinal tap on a more serious level it's the story of a band doing a reunion tour but things are not <UNK> between them i was especially impressed with the performance of bill <UNK> as ray you felt sorry for him yet he had a certain creepiness about him it's a great movie to watch if you have ever seen your favorite band get <UNK> old and pathetic bittersweet highly recommended
<START> when i saw this as a child it answered all of my questions and <UNK> any fears or <UNK> that i had it is easy to watch because it is animated which makes it <UNK> it has no moral bias or preachy aspects so nobody should have any <UNK> to it it is a pleasant film that simply gives the facts of <UNK> in a <UNK> matter of fact way i hope to show it to my daughter
<START> i had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a <UNK> film br br jimmy <UNK> a call centre and one day he is invited by <UNK> <UNK> to teach her boss <UNK> <UNK> english the two fall in love and decide to run away but <UNK> tells jimmy that she can't do this as she owes a debt to <UNK> <UNK> who is also known as <UNK> but they decide and steal money from him and its only then that jimmy finds out that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a don in the meantime <UNK> hires a man bachchan <UNK> to track down jimmy and <UNK> br br starring saif ali khan kareena kapoor anil kapoor and <UNK> kumar the movie is directed by first time director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and is produced by both <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> br br tashan has to be one of the worse films that i have ever watched yes the scenery is good and kareena kapoor and her much <UNK> weight loss looks good but plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other hence why i have said at the beginning that i had expected more from this film as it was a <UNK> production with reference to songs unfortunately there is not one song that i can remember now br br there are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to <UNK> kumar and saif could have definitely done better while kareena kapoor played her part well but this cannot be said for anil kapoor it did not suit him at all as a villain lastly never mind <UNK> <UNK> who in the past has produced and directed good films such as <UNK> what was <UNK> <UNK> doing by producing such a trash movie br br conclusion bad movie not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last impression
<START> la <UNK> de la <UNK> <UNK> or the fall of the house of <UNK> as it's know amongst english audiences starts with allan charles <UNK> heading for the castle of his good friend sir <UNK> <UNK> jean <UNK> who sent him a letter saying that his wife madeleine is ill once there allan finds madeleine very sick her husband <UNK> determined almost obsessed to paint her portrait as <UNK> paints madeleine becomes weaker weaker almost as if the picture is <UNK> the life out of her allan tries to help his friend but tragedy soon strikes br br this french production was co written produced directed by jean <UNK> was the second of two filmed the fall of the house of <UNK> adaptations during <UNK> honestly i don't know the original novel was published in <UNK> i mean you wait <UNK> years for a filmed adaptation two come along at the same time anyway i feel that i have a bit of a problem here as i have read plenty of positive comments about la <UNK> de la <UNK> <UNK> maybe i'm not the right sort of person to write a comment on it but i have to say that it simply didn't do anything for me i didn't like it obviously the first thing to say is that this is a silent film therefore it relies on imagery but even so i thought the story was weak i thought as a whole the film was boring dull even though it only lasts for about an hour it really didn't do anything for me at all la <UNK> de la <UNK> <UNK> was made almost 80 years ago that is literally a lifetime the world cinema tastes have moved on a lot since then i found no enjoyment in this film i feel this film has dated badly probably wasn't that good to start with anyway i never felt for any of the character's i never cared about anything that was happening i found it all rather tedious to sit through i'm sorry if i've offended any silent film fans out there but that's the way i felt br br director <UNK> does an ok job a lot of people <UNK> on about the imagery in la <UNK> de la <UNK> <UNK> i will <UNK> admit it definitely has it's moments but i thought they were few far between shots of people's mouths moving not actually hearing what they say just seemed weird to me i didn't like the music the version i saw kept the original french language insert cards which were narrated by guy with the most awful sounding thick french accent which was also off putting based on the story by edgar allen poe i doubt this has much resemblance to it apart from one or two basic elements stick with the fantastic roger corman house of <UNK> starring vincent price br br technically the film was ok considering when it was made you simply cannot tell about the acting as no one ever speaks although the film is full of unnatural exaggerated movements to try suggest emotions or reflect what's happening which works to an extent but after a while just looks a bit <UNK> br br la <UNK> de la <UNK> <UNK> will appeal to those who <UNK> a <UNK> era who live in <UNK> or who are stuck in the past for me i like my films to have a story not to bore me to have sound i'm sorry if that last statement makes me sound like an <UNK> idiot but that's how i feel the world has moved on since <UNK> for the better
<START> in a poor village in mexico the colonel <UNK> <UNK> lives with his <UNK> wife lola marisa <UNK> in an old house lola still <UNK> the death of their son <UNK> some time ago the colonel has been expecting for his <UNK> of fighter in a war against catholic church for almost twenty seven years however for political reasons the present government wants to forget this old fight without having any possession or money but a valuable <UNK> they struggle to survival with the expectation of the <UNK> letter from the government <UNK> the law and paying for the <UNK> <UNK> this slow and touching movie reflects the social and financial situation of most of the elder retired persons in third world countries in brazil most of the retired persons has to survive with about us 80 00 per month the <UNK> of the colonel in the story were made to pay for a graveyard for his son otherwise he would be buried as an <UNK> outstanding performance of the cast in a very sad story that is reality in the poor countries my vote is eight br br title brazil <UNK> se <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> do not write to the colonel br br
<START> victor <UNK> performance is one of the finest in film history br br i think we can all feel for gypo because we've all <UNK> with what is right and what isn't and been wrong this was one of the first art house pictures to be released by a major american movie studio rko radio pictures br br joseph h <UNK> cinematography is at its very best here however <UNK> stunning portion was mostly overlooked he didn't receive the oscar nomination he rightly deserved br br this is a psychological drama with thought philosophy sadness all conveyed with as little words as possible
<START> i had never heard of this film until i came across it by accident when <UNK> imdb i saw it had gotten many awful reviews containing very colorful <UNK> on how much it <UNK> of course this meant i had to see it i was pleasantly surprised as whipped is actually rather a good movie i watched it with a group of friends and we laughed more than we had at many recent highly acclaimed hollywood fluff comedies this is an independent film and as such portrays its subject matter sex and dating without the usual hollywood <UNK> i distinctly suspect that people's opinion of this film will depend very much on their experience of life if you've never dated or <UNK> much you won't get this movie because you won't have met people like these characters if you have you'll recognize many of the situations that portrayed here in comedic fashion the ending was also good as it did not portray women as unreal helpless <UNK> <UNK> in contrast to many hollywood movies
<START> most would agree that the character of <UNK> is one of the most intriguing characters in comic book history i'm no marvel expert but i did grow up with the adventures of the x men and definitely <UNK> of hugh <UNK> now widely known portrayal of the <UNK> logan i enjoyed the first x men found the sequel too heavy and messy and liked the third one as comic book entertainment all through the three movies i probably enjoyed jackman more than anything else i figured the idea of making an origins movie about <UNK> could very well end up being a better movie than all of the three x men movies if we concentrate on one character i figured there could be a movie that achieves what i found the second movie failed at being a fairly complex and character driven comic book adventure br br the reason that the <UNK> movie fails is not because the competition is <UNK> after the dark knight it's not even because of a plot development that is beyond obvious and <UNK> even though that certainly isn't good no it's because the movie doesn't even seem to try to begin with this does not qualify as good entertainment there is something about the action in this movie that comes off as so very very automatic with no greater special effects or elements of suspense and when one event will make you predict the following five it almost feels like an uwe boll movie imitating an action adventure movie concept that you've seen a dozen times before of course nothing in this movie is as downright awful as a piece of <UNK> t but when everybody's talking clich√©s as if they are part of a chain of events that is so standard you at least make the connection and that surely is bad enough br br but there is an even bigger problem even a generic action movie is a generic action movie and by the way that makes you forgive a lot of plot holes and character <UNK> i think you find the most fundamental flaw in the very title i mean origins really what to the people behind this movie think about that title what do they mean you want to know the origins of <UNK> he grew up with his brother they ran away from home during dramatic circumstances then they went off to war all of them the civil war world war i and ii and vietnam too why did they do this still unknown eventually the brother <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> became evil how you ask i don't know it was somewhere between <UNK> beach and <UNK> yeah but why you still ask i just said i don't know the movie doesn't explain he's evil alright yeah but you know <UNK> yeah well that's an origin i mean duh anyway eventually they end up with a super secret team of mutant elite soldiers something with the government ho hum <UNK> gets enough and leave his brother for six years he's a happy <UNK> with a loved one who ends up a little <UNK> around the time <UNK> suddenly appears again <UNK> but <UNK> oh shut up and <UNK> decides to be a <UNK> for a bunch of evil scientist who make him a flesh covered metal war animal he goes after all the bad guys and they come after him and after all the fighting he ends up with his memory wiped cue x men the first movie br br there that's the origin you can also find it on the back of the dvd cover the actual movie won't tell you anything else with no worthwhile scenes of action no good heroes villains or characters in general lines from my couch audience fat suit token black guy oh i give you 200 in cash if that girl survives this movie that is supposed to be <UNK> <UNK> yeah well uh huh right not one line of memorable dialog and zero lines to cover a t shirt with added to that the common stupid things that ruin the <UNK> in general that you might usually forgive well that sounds pretty much like a waste of time right fans will check this out or have already there's no stopping that but if you liked the x men movies for no other reason than that they were well made and entertaining see them again and do yourself no <UNK> by trying to look for origins where there are none
<START> what a fun movie st <UNK> is it reminds me of the type of film made during the 40's classic story rounded off by characters and a plot that is neither over dramatic nor overtly complicated in fact it isn't over anything robert lewis <UNK> story here adapted for the screen reads like jane austen for men we do get a tale that has a romance at its heart but there is plenty of fun too battle scenes sort of prison escapes mistaken identities <UNK> and the funniest line i've heard in years only in scotland would guests be announced by name at a masked ball there is much hilarity <UNK> and not a little <UNK> as st <UNK> tries to fight and find his way back to a family and life he barely knew br br the cast is absolutely stellar with the too <UNK> seen jean marc <UNK> absolutely perfect in the title role anna <UNK> is a refreshing delight as the <UNK> <UNK> and miranda richardson nearly walks away with the movie as her wise and <UNK> been there and seen it all aunt susan richard grant provides comic relief of the highest order br br this is not going to be the greatest movie anyone has ever seen but its charms are <UNK> and the entire film fairly <UNK> with an energy that bursts with life
<START> playing <UNK> <UNK> san <UNK> etc the man was pretty wide ranging and a scream i love watching him interact w amanda blake or don <UNK> or <UNK> he clearly was having a ball and i think he made it easier on his guests as well so long as they knew ahead of time it wasn't a <UNK> 19 take kind of production relax and be loose was clearly the name of the game there br br he reminds me of guys like <UNK> <UNK> benny hill maybe jerry lewis some too great timing ancient gags that kept audiences in <UNK> for decades sheer enjoyment about what he was doing his sad little clown he played was good too but in a touching manner br br personally i think he's great having just bought a two dvd set of his shows from <UNK> or so it brings his stuff back in a fond way for me i can remember seeing him on tv at the end of his run when he was <UNK> up the series in 1971 or so br br check this out if you are a fan or curious he was a riot
<START> a friend of mine <UNK> this video to me and i was fairly excited to watch it but after ten minutes of james <UNK> slow pitched <UNK> and lars <UNK> on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion i began to think why am i watching this ' that question will be <UNK> through your minds in 5 ¬ñ 10 minutes after you hit play i gave the tape back the same day as you would suspect not worth buying or watching br br just my opinion br br
<START> most 70s and 80s kong kong martial arts films barely function as movies usually there are a few well planned fight sequences but the plot is <UNK> pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those <UNK> like porno films really br br but this one does several things well most overtly there is the direction and choreography which confines each <UNK> to a <UNK> it's really based on chinese circus <UNK> and comedic theater but the effect works br br second there is the language of the camera which uses some impressive techniques even by today's measure changing projection <UNK> from real time time to slow motion and from <UNK> to <UNK> views to depict story direction toward the past or toward the future br br least overt but most powerful and unexpected is the construction the winner of this contest is determined by who <UNK> the story the master the writer sets up a game where the lead character doesn't know who he's seeking which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in one by one he figures out who is who at the same rate we find out who is who it all follows a tragedy noir arc the ending tends toward irony a la the <UNK> much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre br br the <UNK> <UNK> idea is the <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the kill bill volumes
<START> trying to compare or represent this <UNK> as anything <UNK> is an out n out attempt to <UNK> hitchcock fans to waste 7 on this movie weak acting weak story weak script br br no real suspense no thrills you wait all through the weakness of this movie for the big payoff or even any payoff you're left thinking what the heck was that all about br br and please enough with the movement to make alternative <UNK> hip and politically correct i can't recommend this to anyone did i mention how weak the acting is williams did a better job as peter pan and <UNK> but those were much more innocent times
<START> now i get it the title refers to each audience <UNK> immediate post reaction after <UNK> minutes of mental torture trying too hard to be terrifying lacking good dialogue even any fear for that matter really makes the screaming skull more like a <UNK> dull albeit the mansion and property set in black and white does set a dark tone for the movie but that's about it the only scary thing about this flop is that people actually made money on this remember the coffin guarantee in the beginning that may be the funniest thing i have ever witnessed on screen sad thing is that viewers probably hoped director alex <UNK> was <UNK> placed in a coffin nailed shut and buried alive for his lame effort jenny placed in this unfortunate horrific situation never really draws any sympathy you would feel for a woman whose anxiety is blamed on a haunted <UNK> <UNK> also her husband john comes off as a condescending wannabe smooth <UNK> but this doesn't work and he ends up proving how tough he is by <UNK> a helpless <UNK> around ah <UNK> days before you could get a <UNK> order against estate <UNK> like him this guy's approach is not very good or maybe too much airplane <UNK> still despite his strange persona mickey probably is the only good thing going for this movie providing a slight sense of entertainment and i can't get enough of a guy saying it was mary and <UNK> through <UNK> in a <UNK>
<START> ok i don't really think that trailer park boys has bad story lines because they kick ass they just conflict with each other br br for example near the end of the movie it shows ricky and julian telling patrick lewis to put the dog down and walk away then at the end it shows ricky and julian saying that they've been in jail for 2 years in the tv series pilot the first clip they show is the same clip of ricky and julian yelling at patrick lewis but in the tv series they've supposedly only been in jail for 18 months br br also they give us the impression that the movie's story line and the tv <UNK> story line are connected because of the yelling scene between the guys but some actors portray totally different characters of course patrick roach plays patrick lewis in the movie but in the series he plays randy sam <UNK> plays one of the guys who pays ricky for an <UNK> and then he plays sam <UNK> in the series br br also again i know i have a lot to say in the movie the guys <UNK> coke instead of smoking <UNK> the thing is they never actually confirm that the two story lines are connected in anyway other than the yelling scene br br sorry to keep on <UNK>
<START> while being a great james <UNK> western this film has gone down as the worst <UNK> film ever made the story was terrible <UNK> all through it and just downright <UNK> to boot continuity was cast to the four winds anybody catch the cannon sequence the <UNK> were dumb enough to fire <UNK> that obviously had mud and <UNK> still sticking out of the <UNK> come on then there is brian <UNK> ridiculous hat <UNK> must of been away or something or just out of their mind
<START> <UNK> is a film that has all the elements of a class a western except one the story that really belongs to a class b or c that was acceptable at the time the film was made when people were so thrilled to see a western in color but nowadays it just looks very primitive nonetheless for people who enjoy old westerns it is entertaining the original color and sound are very well kept on the dvd that recently came out <UNK> hayes is a good sidekick <UNK> <UNK> is mean as always and randolph scott a bit more cheerful than usual in a film named <UNK> you would expect to see something that would remind you of the city but the town that is shown here could be just anywhere
<START> except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads this movie is really really bad the cheap production values don't help of course you wouldn't really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn't keep trying to convince you they had a production values to begin with even for a b movie genre freak like myself this movie really sucks
<START> this sci fi adventure is not the best and by no means the worst i agree with the statement that bad sci fi is comical bizarre pink <UNK> and unusual special effects make this a favorite for the late late late show viewers space <UNK> on the planet mars fight off strange giant <UNK> like monsters and other strange creatures pretty cool br br the cast includes les <UNK> <UNK> hayden <UNK> <UNK> and jack <UNK> get <UNK> and enjoy don't feel bad if you nod off for a moment i agree with adding this to the list of cult classics to not miss
<START> overall this movie is dreadful and should have never been made one of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters for example if she is about to be attacked you want to feel oh my god no but you don't in this case you don't care because there is no link that has been made to know the character in the trailer it seemed as though the movie would be great yet there is no suspense what so ever really there could have been maybe some mystery but there is not all she has is a <UNK> was said on the dvd's back you would think that it was carefully planned this movie and cleverly made but it is not the ending was just awful very straight forward and pointless too the acting is either average or below average maybe even lower in my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life the special effects and sets were average too nothing special what so ever there is not much gore or bloody violence not much blood is shown this movie was advertised to make it sound quite amazing yet really its not even worth looking for i do not recommend this to anyone unless they are easily satisfied by a few fights and a boring story
<START> this film has a clear storyline which is quite unusual to the musical genre cats phantom of the opera and other andrew lloyd <UNK> musicals can be considered <UNK> as they use literary works as their <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 's storyline touches the very core of human relationships especially that of <UNK> people despite the fact the film was based on a supposedly fairytale it's actually a fantasy of the <UNK> in <UNK> adults the dance sequences are not perfect yet the songs represent how <UNK> express themselves i <UNK> the choreographer should explore <UNK> way of dancing by not <UNK> the fact that <UNK> dance development tends to be more <UNK> the dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not <UNK> with the songs and or music yet i still love this movie and regard it as a new wave of <UNK> film genre which i hope to improve in the future
<START> this movie is perfect for all the <UNK> in the world john ritter has never been better and has the best line in the movie sam hits close to home is lovely to look at and so much fun to play along with ben <UNK> was an excellent cast and easy to fall in love with i'm sure i've met arthur in my travels somewhere all around an excellent choice to pick up any evening
<START> this movie <UNK> with me on two levels as a kid i was <UNK> from london and planted on unwilling <UNK> in a country village while i escaped the bombing and had experiences which produced <UNK> memories for example hearing a <UNK> sing one dark night for the very first time and enjoying a life i never could have had in london i missed my family and worried about them tom is an old man whose wife and child have both died and who lives alone in a small country village as an old man who is now without a wife whose kids have gotten married and live far away in another <UNK> i am again sometime lonely the boy's mother is a religious fanatic with very odd ideas of raising a child since a deep affection has grown between old tom <UNK> and this young <UNK> tom goes in search of him and finally <UNK> him from very odd and dangerous circumstances at the end of the story there is great tension since due to some <UNK> <UNK> it seems that the child is going to lose someone who has developed a loving relationship with him
<START> <UNK> <UNK> and three <UNK> search for <UNK> treasure in the south atlantic br br the treasure hunters led by <UNK> fight a group of <UNK> sharks with cute little <UNK> on their hungry faces <UNK> and his merry men must find a way to take themselves off the menu so they can begin <UNK> an old spanish <UNK> filled with gold <UNK> br br after the crew <UNK> in a small eternity of pushing <UNK> arguing and listening to <UNK> annoying health <UNK> 5 crazy <UNK> board the boat and <UNK> things now it is a battle of wits as to who gets the treasure and who gets to see what the inside of a <UNK> stomach looks like br br at least <UNK> is in shape wearing exactly the same thing he wore in 'the naked <UNK> 10 years earlier and he has remained in excellent condition br br made on a budget of 75 cents
<START> i really loved it although while reading the reviews it was quite disturbing to me but as an anime art fan i can totally understand this perfect art work even though some of it was against my cultures and believes but hey it's the world of art the beginning of the film is very strong strange and confusing it's hard to understand the <UNK> which make me respect the one who made it only someone who is extremely opened can do such daring film it's absolutely not for kids even though the characters are cute and adorable but they go through some disturbing adventures that cannot be <UNK> sorry if the spelling is wrong from ones memory
<START> it's hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn't enough words to give this magnificent stylish and unique film the <UNK> it <UNK> deserves they should make this the official and only true real hamlet movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by kenneth branagh's hamlet br br it's a perfect complete version of the play potent massive <UNK> first class masterpiece shakespeare would have been proud of they've packed over a dozen of world famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a <UNK> sense of satisfaction br br the cameras embrace <UNK> the enchanting <UNK> branagh is phenomenal in the leading role his sharp irresistible performance is the only one of it's kind and will be <UNK> part of the glorious movie history every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end branagh's version of hamlet is among the ten best motion pictures ever
<START> my family and i have viewed this movie often over the years it is clean wholesome heartbreaking and heartwarming showing us the compassion between two families of two countries thousands of miles apart and by the most uncanny of <UNK> it's almost as if the hand of god had to be <UNK> br br 5 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who plays <UNK> the heart stricken little girl does a magnificent job of acting her part and for me she was the <UNK> choice for the lead role br br all in all a 10 out of 10 there are no <UNK> to this sweet human story children of all ages will <UNK> then <UNK> watch this and it will bring the viewing family together with smiles and good feelings
<START> when this film was released in 1997 the <UNK> <UNK> such as they are were poor they would have been dated even for the 1980s and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s have had the same or better <UNK> work certainly no one involved in the production of this film was looking for an oscar it's a wild departure from director fred <UNK> <UNK> usual stuff most of which has the word bikini in the title bikini pirates bikini chain gang bikini girls from the lost planet etc and are little more than t a flicks but here we are with a film rated u and aimed <UNK> at the <UNK> you've got to give him credit for <UNK> this was a minor direct to video cult hit which later resulted in a couple of sequels invisible mom 2 and invisible dad dee wallace stone whose career went downhill fast after <UNK> e t plays the <UNK> <UNK> of the films title and would return for the sequel russ <UNK> whose career had been in free fall even longer since <UNK> west side story plays the villainous dr <UNK> it's probably fair to say that most of the cast were at the point in their careers where they would be prepared to work on almost anything just to pay the bills that month except maybe young <UNK> knight as josh it's rather telling though that although he worked prior to this movie this child actor didn't work again after the sequel invisible mom 2 maybe the film was cursed after all he wasn't that bad in this film for a child actor he's pretty good no better or worse than any of his more experienced co stars br br as mentioned above the <UNK> effects are <UNK> to say the least the direction is poor the writing obvious and the acting nothing to write home about there are plenty of worse films out there though and for anyone under the age of about ten this film will no doubt be quite watchable most adults will probably want to do a disappearing act of their own while it is on though and i wouldn't blame them one bit
<START> i couldn't watch more than 14 minutes of it it's a great combination of really bad acting and really bad directing the shots used are disgusting they broke the <UNK> degrees angle all the time my head hurts try to watch that load of you know what dirt on the mystery machine window make you see light from the lighting on the windows annoying what else it's so badly framed all the time it's just make you want to scream at that lady directing there i only directed short films but i'm pretty sure i'd be way better than that directing a feature film the story is unbelievable just the long french kissing scene at the beginning tell you that it's gonna be pretty awful so pretty much try to avoid this really bad movies at all cost it'll save you the 5 bucks or so for the rental and that <UNK> hour of your life you'll never get back
<START> as the first of the tv <UNK> offered on the elaborate box set barbra streisand the television <UNK> released last november this disc is being released <UNK> for those who do not want to <UNK> over the dollars for all five <UNK> as an investment this is indeed the best of the bunch if only for the fact that this is streisand at her <UNK> and most eager to impress that she succeeds so brilliantly is a key <UNK> of her legend signed to a long term contract with cbs to produce hour long variety shows an almost <UNK> format nowadays streisand was all of 22 in this cbs special first broadcast in april 1965 at that point of her career her <UNK> was limited to a handful of best selling albums a few dazzling tv appearances on variety and talk shows and her successful broadway run in funny girl br br filmed in crisp black and white the program is divided into three distinct parts with the creative <UNK> use of i'm late from disney's alice in wonderland the first segment cleverly shows her growing up from childhood through numbers as diverse as make believe and i'm five opening with a comic monologue about pearl from <UNK> the second part moves on location to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> where she is <UNK> <UNK> in a series of glamorous outfits while singing depression era songs like i've got plenty of <UNK> and the best things in life are free with comic irony back to <UNK> the third segment is a straight ahead concert which opens with a <UNK> version of when the sun comes out includes a funny girl <UNK> and ends with her classic <UNK> take on happy days are here again over the ending credits also included is the brief introduction she taped in 1986 when the special was first released on vhs for those who know streisand only for her <UNK> concert tickets and political <UNK> this is a genuine eye opener into why she is so <UNK> now
<START> once upon a time some evil people made a movie about a guy that got shot into space supposedly to go to <UNK> but really only to some stock footage of <UNK> <UNK> and then he gets a nose bleed and before you know it he's laying in a hospital <UNK> head to foot and then an overweight nurse with an ill fitting uniform comes in and gets eaten by the guy whose supposed to be melting all over the place but never seems to lose any mass and then <UNK> or at least one guy at <UNK> gets upset about it and calls one other guy in to hunt him down but the guy they sent to hunt the melting guy has to go home and have soup first and his oddly shaped wife forgot the <UNK> so he can't have <UNK> and then he has to go out and look for the melting guy with a <UNK> counter and that doesn't really work so he really only follows the trail of half eaten corpses and then there's something about a sheriff and two ugly old people in a <UNK> <UNK> and a women with a meat <UNK> and some kind of industrial plant with trigger happy security guards and since i can't tell you how the movies ends all i can say is jonathan <UNK> is in it somewhere with some guy with the stupid name of <UNK> <UNK> and if there's any justice in the world everyone connected with this movie died a hideous violent death and was unable to make more movies and the world lived happily ever after the end
<START> way way back in the 1980s long before <UNK> was <UNK> and <UNK> began to shed their national identities the united states and japan were at each other's throat in the world <UNK> race remember <UNK> like <UNK> yes ' 'the japanese are taking this country over ' and <UNK> are lazy ' br br as the reagan era <UNK> down and <UNK> edged towards a global <UNK> director ron howard made one of several <UNK> into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash <UNK> ho ' which drew over <UNK> million in u s box office <UNK> while in many ways dated <UNK> tongue in cheek story of <UNK> cultures in the <UNK> still offers hard truth for industrial life today br br <UNK> <UNK> focuses on hunt stevenson michael keaton the <UNK> union <UNK> from <UNK> a small depressed town in the <UNK> of <UNK> stevenson has been asked to visit the <UNK> <UNK> company in tokyo similar to real life <UNK> which is considering a u s operation at the town's empty plant with hundreds of residents out of work and the town <UNK> on collapse <UNK> decides to move in and stevenson is hired as a <UNK> between company officials and workers on the <UNK> line br br the <UNK> minutes of <UNK> <UNK> is a humorous look at these two sides with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered on one hand an american <UNK> that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade <UNK> on the other hand japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self worth in stevenson we find an american working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through <UNK> with the survival of his <UNK> jobs and most of <UNK> on the line stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance although his <UNK> will sink him into a great deal of trouble besides answering to the heads of <UNK> we witness a delicate <UNK> act between stevenson and his fellow union members many of whom he grew up with this includes buster george <UNK> willie john <UNK> and paul clint howard <UNK> brother br br the japanese cast is headed by <UNK> <UNK> also known for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> ' <UNK> plays <UNK> the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for american life he is constantly <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the nephew of <UNK> <UNK> who is desperate to take his spot in the <UNK> order while given a light touch these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the japanese working culture br br with hunt stevenson <UNK> the script michael keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work <UNK> <UNK> is indeed a slam <UNK> success for keaton who also teamed with ron howard in <UNK> 'the paper ' he made this film during a string of lighter roles that included <UNK> mom ' <UNK> juice ' and 'the dream <UNK> before <UNK> into <UNK> ' <UNK> good cop ' and <UNK> life ' it's also hard not to like <UNK> <UNK> performance as the odd man out who first wears japanese <UNK> of shame before <UNK> up with stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unit br br the supporting cast is top notch including <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> rogers supplies a romantic interest as audrey <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> teamed up for <UNK> <UNK> solid writing the incidental music which received a <UNK> film music award was composed by thomas newman <UNK> <UNK> soundtrack songs are wall to wall 80s including <UNK> get me wrong ' <UNK> <UNK> ' and <UNK> class man ' br br the success of <UNK> <UNK> actually led to a short lived tv series on abc while more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago ron <UNK> film still has its comic value it is available on dvd as part of the paramount widescreen collection and is a tad short changed audio <UNK> are provided in english 5 1 surround english <UNK> surround and french <UNK> ' but subtitles are in english only there are no extras not even the theatrical trailer on the plus side <UNK> digital transfer is quite good with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound while a few extras would have been helpful especially that <UNK> <UNK> was a box office success there's little to complain about the film presentation itself br br out of 4
<START> from the opening shots of the lead actor we are given a early view on how so many <UNK> lives are run by the women in them and the humour that comes thru with all that goes on in the day to day of <UNK> life br br eric <UNK> the director picks up on how so many european men feel that they are in complete control of their lives yet without the help support of the women around them cannot seem to make things work the use of facial image throughout the film is superb and his clever <UNK> of the senior member of the family mother is spot on br br while there are more than enough laughs in the movie it still deals with single parents <UNK> and the strength of family in society truly rewarding to watch and again one that only the french <UNK> capable to make br br so far one of the best 50 or so films i have seen this year and well worth a five start rating i look forward to adding this one to the dvd collection when it is released and highly recommend it to all ages
<START> bar some of the questionable acting there musicians at the end of the day this in the words of quentin <UNK> is the best rock movie ever made period br br think 8 mile but without the <UNK> a young musician trying to prove himself to the local community whilst struggling to cope with a broken home and a rival band throw in the sex interest and the truly exceptional performances this is the real 8 mile br br prince provides a solid performance as does morris day and <UNK> <UNK> decent script good direction great plot and spectacular performances not forgetting the some of the best rock pop <UNK> music you will ever hear
<START> horror movie really i cant believe how bad this movie was what the point of this movie the movie almost <UNK> and 30 min and the first 70 minutes of it is just lena walking around with this stupid look on her face after she had an accident not much talking at all not even much actions at all i have to say tho the last 20 <UNK> it got little tiny action and was still stupid and the end oh my god i don't know where to begin it also end up with this stupid look on lena face lol don't get me wrong i love lena <UNK> i think she is great actress but i don't know what got into her to do this movie don't waste your time and watching it because this movie has no story has no acting and has no point not to mention how slow this movie goes and it feels like you been watching it forever
<START> the movie concerns about philip leslie howard he's a serious but handicapped medicine student he falls <UNK> in love with a heartless <UNK> waitress called mildred bette davis she leaves him engaging with others alan hale <UNK> <UNK> meanwhile he is <UNK> with another <UNK> kay johnson frances dee but she goes back in a <UNK> destructive affair br br easily the best and first of numerous films versions of <UNK> <UNK> novel bette davis as the cockney cruel waitress winning yet another magnificent interpretation with an <UNK> and <UNK> performance absolutely hypnotic in her account of the bondage that occurs from the beginning to the finale davis rose the stardom with her performance her role as tough and crude <UNK> woman will be repeated several times in <UNK> acting leslie howard as the essentially good and decent student subtly destroyed gives an excellent and <UNK> performance he was an awesome actor gone with the wind besides producer and writer and dead in plane crash during wwii both will play again in <UNK> <UNK> 1936 the atmosphere film is <UNK> <UNK> in the rko radio picture inc studio is entirely convincing remade in 1946 by edmund <UNK> with <UNK> parker and paul <UNK> and in 1964 by ken hughes with kim novak and laurence harvey the motion picture will like to classic cinema buffs rating very good but a little bit dated
<START> <UNK> de <UNK> was made on the <UNK> of the <UNK> from silence to sound which came a little later in europe than in hollywood originally conceived as a silent it was released with a dubbed soundtrack in france with a french actress speaking louise <UNK> lines but was released as a silent in italy and other parts of europe i was lucky enough to see the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> flawless new <UNK> of an italian silent print at the <UNK> film festival i haven't seen the <UNK> version yet but i think it's safe to assume the silent version is much more satisfying since by all reports the dubbing is poorly done louise brooks is clearly speaking english so there's no way her lips could be matched also the film is made entirely in the silent style with few titles and little need for dialogue <UNK> de <UNK> tells its story visually with exciting imaginative camera work the opening is instantly <UNK> with rapidly cut scenes of urban life and <UNK> <UNK> at a public beach throughout the film there is an emphasis on visual detail on clothing <UNK> decoration and symbolic images such as a <UNK> bird a heap of torn photographs a diamond <UNK> this is silent film technique at its <UNK> br br louise brooks of course is responsible for saving the film from obscurity seeing this makes it only more heartbreaking to reflect that this was her last starring role <UNK> beautiful she <UNK> the film with her charisma and also gives a perfectly natural yet highly charged performance her role here more than in the <UNK> films for which she's best known is a woman we can fully understand and sympathize with she plays <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> with a <UNK> fianc√© who <UNK> to get more out of life and secretly enters a beauty contest with immediate success she is then torn between the excitement of her glamorous new life and her love for the man who insists she give it all up or lose him all of the characters are drawn with nuance the fianc√© <UNK> pity and is not merely a <UNK> he loves <UNK> but is a limited man who can't cope with her having a life apart from him or <UNK> the <UNK> of other men even the other man in the story is not the simple <UNK> we first take him for though his intentions may be just as <UNK> as the <UNK> br br warning spoilers below br br the film has many fine set pieces including <UNK> triumph in the miss europe contest shown through the comic reactions of <UNK> audience members who wind up <UNK> the heroine with flowers her misery as a housewife <UNK> <UNK> while the <UNK> of the <UNK> clock marks time behind her a nightmarish trip to a fun fair in the silent version this occurs late in the film after her marriage at which <UNK> crushed among the low <UNK> and depressed by her husband's macho antics decides that she can't go on with her present existence and especially the final scene in the projection room where she views her <UNK> screen test louise brooks may never have looked more beautiful than she does here with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on her <UNK> profile her shoulders <UNK> in white fur her face <UNK> under the black helmet of hair as she watches herself singing on screen the double shot of her exquisite corpse and her still living image on the screen is particularly poignant louise <UNK> image like <UNK> remains immortal despite her <UNK> <UNK> film career
<START> while the movie does feel a bit long at times it is well worth it gordon directs in a style that reminds you of <UNK> writing styles <UNK> thoughtful ironic quirky and dark this is a film which will stay with you for quite a while begging for answers to impossible questions nolte goodman and arkin are all incredible <UNK> lee is wonderful as well in a role that will remind us lynch fans of her laura <UNK> days do not miss this one
<START> i don't think i'll ever understand the hate for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hard <UNK> was cool and he gave the world <UNK> one of the most awesome action movies ever that's right you little <UNK> <UNK> rules and we all know it br br sly plays <UNK> walker a former rescue <UNK> who is <UNK> <UNK> his old town when he is asked to help a former friend hal tucker michael <UNK> assist in a rescue on a mountain peak walker obviously came back at a convenient time because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by eric <UNK> john <UNK> <UNK> co have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the u s government somewhere in the rocky mountains and they really would like it back br br essentially <UNK> is another <UNK> <UNK> clone just trade in the confines of <UNK> <UNK> to the open mountain <UNK> of the rocky mountains complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal naturally that set up is totally ripped to <UNK> soon enough as <UNK> character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease and <UNK> face first into several rock faces with no apparent side effects after all isn't that what action movies are all about br br <UNK> is one of the most exciting action movies around a showcase of great scenes and stunts one of the early stunts is one of the best stunts i've ever seen in a movie and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning it maintains its action <UNK> john <UNK> lead villain is entertaining and one bad dude quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever br br <UNK> is easily one of <UNK> best efforts definitely <UNK> <UNK> best effort and a very exciting action movie 9 10
<START> i'll keep the review of this program as short as possible skip it low budget not funny lousy script acting not quite as bad as the writing but still bad that's all you need to know but i will continue for the sake of writing more than necessary br br this is a film with three segments each one <UNK> some other type of movie a much funnier film with this same exact idea is movie movie with george c scott very obscure but worth searching out <UNK> <UNK> films of the 1930's and did it with <UNK> <UNK> and dry wit br br this movie did not it parodies three types of films supposedly from the late 70's early 80's era only it is <UNK> films i've almost never heard of the first is i guess a parody of kramer vs kramer in a way peter <UNK> does his best with a dirt poor script the second is a parody of i don't know what a <UNK> steele novel i mean you might see a story like this on lifetime tv but in a movie theater i mean i remember the 70's i was there this is a soap opera type parody about a <UNK> young woman who sleeps her way to power these type of things usually parody themselves so i don't see how this was even necessary br br we are on somewhat easier ground with the third segment the <UNK> which parodies cop movies i noted elements of the new <UNK> and some dirty harry both of which were almost 10 years old when the film was created yeah nice and current <UNK> benson plays the idealistic young rookie over the top <UNK> while richard widmark plays the <UNK> veteran cop who drinks <UNK> while sitting in the police car oh stop my sides he's actually drinking booze in the police car how <UNK> note that this was the first film after animal house to have the national lampoon name attached wow to go in five years from that classic flick to this pile of dung is nothing short of shocking i could go on for hours about the sad decline that caused one of the most cutting edge and original voices in american humor that would be national lampoon the original magazine for about its first 10 years or so to sell out and begin a long slow slide into a world of crap where now the magazine is long gone and it only exists as a brand name to slap on low budget comedy films for a <UNK> yet another reason why capitalism and cocaine sucks so bad br br anyway this movie is a serious time suck don't waste your 90 minutes i want mine back on the positive side fred <UNK> in it
<START> i just watched this movie on showtime quite by accident actually if i wouldn't have only had 6 <UNK> of sleep for the past two days then i wouldn't have came home early from work if i hadn't came home early from work i wouldn't have seen this movie i wouldn't have known what i was missing but i would've missed a lot br br that's the way this movie is it's almost playing on the kevin bacon effect that and <UNK> hence my <UNK> above ever character is <UNK> in some way or another action reaction interaction non interaction this movie is just wonderful i'm going to have to find a copy to buy
<START> <UNK> first two films were snappy stylish entertainment here he <UNK> two recent classics ¬ñ 'the usual <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ¬ñ and still comes out empty handed br br despite <UNK> itself as a con mystery with the sub <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the greatest con he ever pulled was convincing you that he was you or whatever it was and attempting a <UNK> <UNK> twist about which characters are real and which are internal <UNK> the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half by the last third you know you're being lead down a blind alley and <UNK> slowly at that br br cons chess and game theory are all great subjects but ritchie <UNK> into them too <UNK> and too <UNK> to make much use of the material br br the only thing that keeps the movie almost watchable is <UNK> bold way with with a scene and maurice <UNK> dynamic camera if ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot and <UNK> to <UNK> editing there's no reason why he couldn't have made another enjoyable gangster caper br br as it is revolver is a waste of your time <UNK> does not equal <UNK> if you want to see a great film that doesn't make logical sense but makes a virtue of it and incidentally which also involves an inexplicable escape from <UNK> <UNK> watch <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this was an awful movie basically jane march was a half korean north korean spy sent by kim <UNK> <UNK> to do something horrible to the american forces in south korea she becomes a maid for an american military family they all regard her as being korean even though she looks more white i believe the actress is either 1 4 or 1 8 <UNK> asian not at all korean and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her the way korea and the u s military in korea is depicted is completely insane of course the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men who've never spent a day in korea prior to this movie and had no intention of showing any real insight into life in korea for either <UNK> or american <UNK> and instead just tried to fulfill their pathetic <UNK> fantasies without any regard to how completely unbelievable it made the movie anyone who's ever been to korea will know this is utter garbage in the end the north korean <UNK> spy girl gets killed in an obvious paying for her sins way very bad film with a made for tv feel to it
<START> i finally got my wish to see this one in a cinema i'd seen fritz <UNK> film on video some years ago i'd been hoping that ideal screening conditions would work their magic br br conditions were ideal at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> full length print <UNK> in the original gothic script german with <UNK> english translation accurate without being too literal live piano <UNK> ideal br br the film's magic <UNK> for a little while but ultimately failed to catch at least for me br br this film bears no real relation to <UNK> ring cycle as i already knew but some may not wagner had adapted the 13th c <UNK> to his own purposes part i of fritz <UNK> epic <UNK> has much that will be familiar to <UNK> of wagner however br br <UNK> revenge is the story of <UNK> wife <UNK> her marriage to king <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and her desire for revenge against <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> for the murder of <UNK> the spectacular <UNK> in this film presumably evolved and expanded in the <UNK> <UNK> into his <UNK> his twilight of the gods and the end of <UNK> this film remains <UNK> br br most of the film is spectacular the massive sets rival those of <UNK> <UNK> which inspired <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> their decoration sets a new <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> there's a huge cast of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and art <UNK> <UNK> and battles battles that never seem to end in fact br br <UNK> is very successful in her plan of revenge she manages to destroy all around her her loyalty to her <UNK> <UNK> seems not to <UNK> so much from love or devotion but from something closer to <UNK> lady <UNK> cried out <UNK> me here she knew she was emotionally <UNK> for what she needed to do but <UNK> displays no normal human emotions and certainly nothing one <UNK> with the feminine principle she is already top full of <UNK> cruelty to borrow shakespeare's phrase from the outset <UNK> <UNK> and her director convey this with a <UNK> i don't want to <UNK> but that <UNK> is virtually the only expression ever to <UNK> <UNK> face it's the ultimate in one note performances it's clearly intentional however not simply a case of poor acting br br what we have then on offer is a one dimensional sketch of an <UNK> fury some might see <UNK> as an <UNK> heroine i just see the film as misogynistic
<START> maybe it was the title or the trailer certainly not the interview on the dvd which is with the director as he keeps saying hi kids into the camera like a <UNK> but i had expectations for <UNK> of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal bloody killings by a weird japanese <UNK> turns out it's way too sleazy for its own good or bad or whatever there's a problem and one can see this also in the italian <UNK> flick porno holocaust similar to this in many respects in not having balance to the sex and violence too much sex and it will turn into a <UNK> porno and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies and with the killing scenes there has to be at least a little <UNK> and maybe just a <UNK> of <UNK> in creating the creature killer whatever <UNK> of a virgin has neither it's safe to say it's a pretty soulless movie even if isn't one of the very worst ever made it's there just for horn dog japanese <UNK> to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their <UNK> heads br br in this case we're given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls nothing too <UNK> and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by a murderer as he's credited first off the director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> decides he has to put in a <UNK> of random sex scenes early on we get spliced in or <UNK> in take your pick clips of one of the <UNK> having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere it looks like it's from another movie then once settled into the house there's a <UNK> scene that's poorly choreographed and shot yeah we really need to see him <UNK> there and then on to the rape and killings first the rape by the <UNK> who promise the girls some jobs for their time then the murderer who like <UNK> creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial and who for an unknown reason kills the men and or rapes the women one by one br br now the latter of those taken by themselves should be considered the highlights of the movie this is like saying however that the <UNK> are the best part of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> an eye <UNK> scene a spike thrown like an olympic event that scene actually is kind of cool and finally the <UNK> of the overly sex crazed girl whose <UNK> name i can't remember even this becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title on top of this the sex scenes which become tedious through <UNK> and his <UNK> in long takes without <UNK> where everything by the japanese censors is <UNK> anyway are dubbed over by the actors you'd think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough hence the need to let them <UNK> for themselves but the overall feeling from <UNK> of a virgin is that of a <UNK> one where it's just there to be <UNK> at and without a shred of suspense or true horror watch as the last girl left alive the virgin of the picture tries to stop the murderer from getting to her which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him you just want it to be done with for the 'i hate <UNK> <UNK> to ease up or be rid altogether
<START> sweet sixteen 1983 <UNK> minutes director jim <UNK> cast bo hopkins susan <UNK> <UNK> shirley patrick <UNK> dana <UNK> br br fifteen year old bad girl melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off the detective has to put together the clues with the help of his nancy drew good girl daughter played by friday the 13th <UNK> dana <UNK> the local native americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the <UNK> <UNK> these events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at <UNK> <UNK> birthday party br br this below average slasher isn't too memorable it has a made for tv feel without much score besides the title character's own corny theme song which plays a couple times throughout lines like the killer will turn us into <UNK> fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays <UNK> calls melissa a bad name then somehow immediately they develop a friendship apparently <UNK> sees how hard it is to fit in because melissa knows how to wear make up this movie would be hard pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director <UNK> multiple gratuitous close ups of her the social commentary on indians wasn't developed enough to be taken seriously i am too surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets both sweet sixteen and ed <UNK> bloody birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time <UNK> tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage but i feel failed to deliver but on the bright side releasing obscure movies like this on dvd gives hope that others will follow
<START> loved this show smart acting smart dialog great storyline with real people please bring it back or make it available online really miss it hope davis really shines in this show i like the idea of six degrees it really makes sense in this insane world rid yourself of those stupid reality shows and give this show a second chance please bring it back not to <UNK> but please when it went off the air i watched in online and liked how i could watch it with minimal <UNK> in fact online abc makes it easy to enjoy shows when you miss them on prime time gone are the days of endless <UNK> anytime you want to bring it back i am ready
<START> ok this movie so far has been <UNK> by critics and board posters alike although playing devil's <UNK> you could suggest that critics are often people who didn't make it for themselves as film makers and board posters are often people who didn't make it for themselves as critics so i wanted to sit in guy's corner with the magic <UNK> to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who've decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of <UNK> at it br br the film's biggest flaw in <UNK> wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is this has been described many times as as making the film <UNK> to the viewer the film's <UNK> is relatively non linear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle or not so subtle hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory ie ray <UNK> character <UNK> a gun saying the words fear me is portrayed as both <UNK> pathetic from <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> and bold from <UNK> <UNK> this is but one example of <UNK> far more mature approach he has taken to film making with revolver we have a storyline which is pretty <UNK> the strong but silent gritty anti hero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption i mean it's paint by numbers film noir here guys all the way down to the vague poetic choice of <UNK> and the gritty voice overs but then guy has taken this <UNK> to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex points br br take the scene where jason <UNK> character runs <UNK> of a car this throwaway sequence could have been <UNK> from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever but ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death br br so the final act of the movie is pretty mind <UNK> i'd be taking the p ss if i said i didn't spend the last 20 minutes or so of the film turning to my date going uh wtf but that is the <UNK> reason to disregard a piece of art it is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand and even easier to say well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film in my humble opinion revolver is a stylish complex and mature piece of modern art which should be <UNK> with the same manner we would give the work of the <UNK> brothers if we choose this opportunity to <UNK> say ah sh t i wanted a film about a load of <UNK> cockney gangsters in <UNK> <UNK> guy ritchie is a <UNK> then the day will come when film makers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow crappy people just because guy made a name for himself with funny <UNK> cockney <UNK> doesn't mean he can't be deep without being pretentious funny people can be thoughtful too
<START> this was an <UNK> good historical drama john <UNK> is excellent as the tortured genius luzhin and brilliantly portrays the character's manic <UNK> such as his strange dancing emily watson is fine in her support role as the sensitive lover <UNK> br br the <UNK> between chess and near madness is well explored by <UNK> and familiar <UNK> <UNK> such as <UNK> <UNK> i e <UNK> are evident in this film i think i will now go on to read the novel it was a touching and tragic ending and it was hard to keep a dry eye brilliant movie
<START> our teacher showed us this movie in first grade i haven't seen it since i just watched the trailer though does this look like a first grade movie to you i don't think so i was so horrified by this movie i could barely watch it it was mainly the scene with shirley <UNK> cutting that little girl in half and then there was the boy with <UNK> i was freaked out by this film now today being 20 i probably would not feel that way i just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn't see this movie even though it's pg be aware of the possible <UNK> of showing this to kids i don't even remember what it was about once was enough
<START> i just finished watching going overboard i have to say that we should send every copy of this film to iraq and make them watch i even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min adam sandler could not find a better project than this as for the writing if thats what you want to call it those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in hell i believe that somewhere i read that the budget for this film was 10 000 and they were way under did <UNK> get a good deal on this every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor the only good thing about this movie is you can use the dvd as a coaster or trade it to a friend but then they might not be your friend anymore
<START> michael williams who works for bbc finds a somehow impressive italian picture which gets mixed in the material of his ongoing task titled diabolical art a documentary but since his wife's mysterious death her daughter emily has been emotionally disturbed so he goes <UNK> where the <UNK> picture is with her and her <UNK> jill and there is a <UNK> who is also a psychic and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named <UNK> was executed michael doesn't believe her story but after that emily has hysterical <UNK> and jill is killed this italian film is of course almost <UNK> influenced by the exorcist but this one is much cheaper much simpler and in a sense much <UNK> first of all it should be said this film is full of confusion for instance the story shows emily is a reincarnation of <UNK> but when emily sees her in the flashbacks she <UNK> her exclusively from a third person's point of view but if she is the reincarnation of <UNK> she should and must see the past from nothing but <UNK> point of view <UNK> of this kind which the film has many are almost exclusively based upon a <UNK> fact that the film is too cowardly rather than <UNK> to <UNK> its own quasi <UNK> theme namely pre adolescent girl's one way incestuous wish to make matters worse this film also has characteristic problem if not confusion every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic and or believable living human regarding emily or <UNK> she is after all a child and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her <UNK> and <UNK> and according to the <UNK> theory every girl wants to have her father's child <UNK> in her own way in this sense emily is not exclusively <UNK> only her way of <UNK> other women from her father's love is <UNK> <UNK> but as i already mentioned this film per se is too cowardly to be <UNK> the problem is that adult characters are as childish and naive and helpless as emily is and because of this characteristic weakness even the psychic who can see almost everything cannot do anything down to earth and because of the same weakness the very story of the film is ended in a badly <UNK> way in addition special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable although <UNK> <UNK> music is <UNK> beautiful indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap b film which can disappoint even the <UNK> italian horror film lovers
<START> this movie is one reason imdb should allow a vote of 0 10 the acting is awful even what some here have <UNK> the <UNK> character the script looks like it was written in <UNK> in one scene the black preacher who was left behind when asked by buck what <UNK> in the computer graphic meant said daniel 7 chapter 24 he probably meant <UNK> 24 but the film makers missed this slip up perhaps the worst part is that the film's <UNK> position is <UNK> <UNK> while many christians have <UNK> the film's interpretation of end time events such interpretation in my opinion is <UNK> to understand these flaws read christians will go through the <UNK> by jim <UNK> and the blessed hope a biblical study of the second <UNK> and the rapture by george e <UNK>
<START> the movie macarthur begins and ends at gen douglas <UNK> gregory peck <UNK> <UNK> the us military academy of west point on the hudson we see a <UNK> <UNK> year old gen macarthur give the <UNK> speech to the <UNK> class of <UNK> about what an honor it is to serve their country the film then goes into an almost two hour long flashback on gen <UNK> brilliant as well as controversial career that starts in the darkest hours of wwii on the <UNK> island of <UNK> in the <UNK> in the early spring of 1942 br br told to leave he island for australia before the japanese military <UNK> it gen macarthur for the very first time in his military career almost <UNK> a direct order from his superior us president franklin d <UNK> dan <UNK> feeling that he'll be <UNK> his men at their greatest hour of need macarthur reluctantly together with his wife and young son did what he was told only to have it haunt him for the reminder of the war it was that reason his escape under fire from death or <UNK> by the japanese that drove gen macarthur to use all his influence to get <UNK> two years later to launch a major invasion of the <UNK> instead of the island of <UNK> to back up his promise to both the <UNK> people as well as the thousands of us <UNK> left behind that he'll return and return with the might of the us army navy to back up his <UNK> br br in the two years up until the invasion of the <UNK> islands gen <UNK> <UNK> the japanese forces in the south <UNK> in a number of brilliantly conceived island hop battles that isolated and <UNK> hundreds of thousands of japanese troops into surrender the general did that suffering far less us military <UNK> then any other allied commander in the war in the pacific br br it was in 1950 <UNK> in the korean war that gen macarthur achieved his most brilliant victory as well as his worst military defeat after <UNK> the <UNK> north korean army in the brilliant and perfectly executed with the <UNK> us marines suffering less then 100 <UNK> back door or left hook invasion of <UNK> gen <UNK> feeling <UNK> sent the us un forces under his command to the very border along the <UNK> river of communist red china told by his <UNK> that he's facing the threat of a massive ground attack by communist chinese troops gen macarthur pressed on anyway until that attack did <UNK> cutting the us un forces to <UNK> the <UNK> wave after wave of attacking red chinese troops forced the us un forces to <UNK> in the big bug out of 1950 with their very lives leaving all their equipment behind across the north korean border even <UNK> the south korean capital city of <UNK> this turned out to be one of the biggest military disaster in us history with the us forces losing a record in the korean war 1 000 lives on the very first day <UNK> <UNK> 30 1950 of the communist chinese invasion br br shocked and <UNK> in what he allowed due mostly to his own arrogance to happened macarthur went on the offensive not against the <UNK> communist chinese and <UNK> <UNK> forces but his own commander and chief <UNK> harry s truman ed <UNK> in him not having the spin or guts to do what has to be done launch a full scale invasion of communist china with nuclear weapons if necessary to prevent its troops from <UNK> the korean <UNK> for <UNK> truman who had taken just about enough garbage from gen macarthur in him running off his mouth in public in how he was <UNK> the war in not going all out like macarthur wanted him to against the red chinese this was the last straw on april 11 1951 <UNK> truman <UNK> <UNK> gen macarthur from his command as supreme commander of the us un forces in korea <UNK> <UNK> brave but very <UNK> decision also by not going along with <UNK> total war <UNK> prevented a third world war from breaking out with the soviet union communist <UNK> ally who at the time like the us had the atomic bomb <UNK> <UNK> controversial decision to dump the very popular gen macarthur also cost him his re election in <UNK> with his <UNK> numbers so low in the mid <UNK> that he <UNK> in march of that year from the us presidential campaign br br in was gen <UNK> misfortune to be around when the political and military <UNK> in the world were changing in how to conduct future wars with the horrors of a nuclear war now in 1950 <UNK> a reality it would have been national suicide to go all out like gen macarthur wanted to against the red chinese with it very possibly touching off a nuclear holocaust that would <UNK> not only the us <UNK> red china but the entire world it was that important reality of future war that gen macarthur was never taught since the a and h bomb weren't yet invented in west point br br back to <UNK> we can now see that gen macarthur after finishing his <UNK> speech at west point had become both an older and <UNK> soldier as well as since his retirement from the us military elder <UNK> in his feeling about war and the utter <UNK> of it one thing that gen macarthur was taught at an early age from his civil war general dad douglas macarthur sr that stuck to him all his life was that to a soldier like himself war should be the very last not first resort in <UNK> issues between nations in that it's the soldiers who have to fight and die in it it took a lifetime with the <UNK> of the nuclear age for gen macarthur to finally realize just how right and wise his dad a <UNK> <UNK> of honor winner like himself really was
<START> i had read an article about dan <UNK> olympic and personal journey before seeing this movie i'm always intrigued by a story of hope and <UNK> life <UNK> events and this was no exception br br the background of the characters that is provided gives you a sense of the family's <UNK> and how they positively affected each <UNK> lives i can't speak to the accuracy of specific details in this movie it is <UNK> to take some creative license when <UNK> a script however the spirit of dan and his family is what matters here br br its a worthwhile movie of a story that should be told i felt empathy for the characters and <UNK> at the end
<START> the most interesting thing about <UNK> secret sunshine is the actors <UNK> do <UNK> as lee shin <UNK> the main character is a woman with a young son whose husband has died in a tragic accident and who leaves <UNK> to live in <UNK> which was his home town with her young son <UNK> face is very <UNK> she is <UNK> <UNK> elegant aged and sad desperate and <UNK> with it and terribly isolated by turns and it's all in her face the film also stars song <UNK> ho as kim a man who meets her when her car breaks down coming into <UNK> who happens to run a garage in town and who follows her around all the time thereafter despite her apparent lack of interest in his <UNK> song is the biggest star in korea right now renowned for his work with park chan <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ho sympathy for mr vengeance memories of murder and the host and yet here he plays a throwaway character almost a forgotten man but of course he makes him interesting and curiously appealing he is the essential <UNK> to keep <UNK> character from floating away br br lee shin <UNK> is a piano teacher she comes to the new town which is a neutral place a kind of poor man's <UNK> a town just like anywhere else as kim says just as he is in a way just like anyone else her little boy is <UNK> as little boys are but <UNK> damaged and <UNK> at times too his father used to <UNK> and when he misses him he lies awake pretending to <UNK> he goes to school and shin <UNK> meets parents and students and <UNK> there is a sense of place in the film even though the place is in a sense anywhere people speak in the local <UNK> and everyone knows everything and shin <UNK> <UNK> origin is immediately noticed is life really <UNK> here away from the big city and its sophistication shin <UNK> seems not to realize the danger she is in br br something terrible happens and shin <UNK> doesn't necessarily deal with it in the best possible way but it happens and she must face the consequences but she can't she goes to pieces a <UNK> is caught but that's no <UNK> eventually she becomes so <UNK> she <UNK> and goes to a born again christian meeting an <UNK> has been <UNK> her to attend she finds peace and release with this but when she decides not only to forgive the <UNK> but to go to the prison to tell him so that experience is full of <UNK> and it destroys her all over again she becomes <UNK> and desperate and she no longer finds <UNK> in religion and it gets worse than that br br <UNK> do <UNK> gives her all in this extremely demanding and <UNK> role lee chang <UNK> may be a very good director if an actor of the stature of song <UNK> ho expresses enormous admiration for him that is convincing according to scott <UNK> of la weekly lee's first three films green fish 1997 <UNK> candy 2000 and <UNK> 2002 have marked him out as one of the leading figures of his country's recent cinematic renaissance but this is not as successful a film as those of other korean directors whose work i've seen such as <UNK> sang <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ho and the <UNK> almost <UNK> gifted park chan <UNK> it may indeed begin as <UNK> says as a kind of <UNK> alice doesn't live here anymore and then abruptly and without warning turns into something of a thriller and some time after that a nearly <UNK> study in human suffering but that progression not only seems random and <UNK> the film <UNK> and loses its momentum toward the end and then simply <UNK> out with no sense of an ending there are also weaknesses in the action shin <UNK> takes foolish chances with her son and makes bad choices all along if she is destined for madness like betty in jean jacques <UNK> betty blue which might explain her peculiar and mistaken choices that isn't something that is properly developed this is an interesting film certainly a disturbing one but one that leaves one <UNK> and <UNK> after putting one through an emotional <UNK> br br an official selection of the new york film festival presented at lincoln center <UNK> event that has done right by korean filmmakers in the recent past
<START> nina <UNK> delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little gothic nail <UNK> she accepts a position as secretary to a london society <UNK> played <UNK> by dame may witty and her creepy son the <UNK> and <UNK> george <UNK> before she knows it she <UNK> to find herself in a <UNK> <UNK> she's never seen before where witty and <UNK> are calling her <UNK> and trying to convince the servants and the nearby <UNK> that she's <UNK> mad wife of course this pair can only be planning <UNK> deeds and even though we know julia has to eventually escape her trap director joseph lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of just how she'll manage it br br my name is julia ross has nothing <UNK> to set it apart from any number of films that came out at the same time period but i was surprised by how well it held together despite its shoe string budget and b movie <UNK> there are quite a few moments that just may have you on the edge of your seat and i found myself really rooting for julia as she caught on to the scheme <UNK> and began to <UNK> her <UNK> in any other gothic thriller the heroine would have <UNK> screamed and <UNK> waiting for her hero to come and save her so i can't tell you how refreshing it was to have the heroine in this film use her brain and figure out how to save herself br br well done br br grade b
<START> i am beginning to see a very consistent pattern form in the identity of <UNK> films if 2004 was the year of the <UNK> and 2005 was the year of the political films 2007 can be identified as a year featuring a wide <UNK> of morality tales films that portray test challenge and question human morality and the motives that drive us to do certain things although this <UNK> is rather broad i think that there are a handful of films released this year such as 3 10 to <UNK> eastern promises american gangster no country for old men and others that specifically question and study human morals and the motives that drive us to acts such as violence or <UNK> before the devil knows you're dead is a <UNK> stylish morality tale and quite a dark bleak and depressing one at that and even better is the fact that it comes from one of the greatest classic directorial forces of our time the legendary sidney lumet who many have said has passed his prime but returns in full force with this <UNK> rich crime thriller br br it's one of those films whose plots are so thick that one is very reluctant to go into details it is a movie that is best enjoyed if entered without any prior knowledge to the events about to unfold as there are twists and turns but the thick and richly <UNK> plot is not at all at the center of this film the true focus is as i mentioned the morality tale the motives that drive these two men to the actions they do in the film in a plot structured like a combination between the <UNK> of both the <UNK> brothers namely blood simple and <UNK> and quentin tarantino we see two men driven under various shady circumstances to pull off a fairly simple crime that goes incredibly ridiculously wrong and <UNK> with full force and inevitable tragedy and to make it all the more interesting the film is told in a <UNK> <UNK> that keeps back tracking and showing a series of events following a different character every time and always ending up where it left off the last time <UNK> sharp thick and <UNK> depressing kelly <UNK> screenplay is surprisingly poignant and well rounded in particular because it is a debut screenplay br br but the film has much more going for it than just it's <UNK> sinister and quite depressing plot first and foremost the picture looks and feels <UNK> well sidney lumet has throughout his career consistently employed an interesting style of cinematography and lighting <UNK> and yet stylish at the same time the film carries with it a distinctive air of style and class with wonderful natural lighting that just looks really great editing is top notch combining the <UNK> drama thriller aspect with great long takes that really take their time to portray the action <UNK> and vivid dynamic camera angles and movements further add to the style the film is also backed by a fantastically <UNK> musical score by carter <UNK> br br the screenplay does its part and of course lumet does his part but at the film's dramatic center are three masterful actors who deliver incredibly good performances first and foremost there are the two leads leading the pack is philip seymour hoffman who has always been an excellent actor but has stumbled upon <UNK> leading man status after his <UNK> fantastic oscar winning performance in capote his turn in this film is fascinating severely flawed broken manic hoffman has some truly intense scenes in the film that really allow his full dramatic fury to come out and not just his subtlety and wit at his side is ethan hawke who has delivered some fantastic performances in many films that are almost always overshadowed by greater <UNK> actors here he <UNK> off hoffman and <UNK> him so incredibly well in all the dynamic acting between the two of them is just so utterly fantastic and convincing the audience very quickly loses itself in the characters and forgets that it's watching actors and then there's albert finney such a <UNK> <UNK> supporting role like the one he has requires a veteran professional and here finney delivers his finest performance in many years as the <UNK> obsessed father to the two brothers who get caught up in the crime i love how the dynamics between the three of them play out i love how hoffman is clearly the <UNK> brother and shamelessly picks on his younger brother even now that they're middle aged men and yet despite this it is clear how <UNK> father <UNK> <UNK> younger weaker brother also on the topic of the cast the two supporting female characters ¬ñ wives of the brothers ¬ñ also feature fantastic performances from amy ryan and marisa tomei whose looks just get better and better as the years go by br br this film isn't revolutionary these themes and this style have already been explored by the likes of the <UNK> brothers and it's very easy to imagine them directing this film but for a film that <UNK> familiar ground it simply excels lumet employs his own immense directorial talent and employs his unique and very subtle sense of irony and style to <UNK> brilliantly vivid intense and <UNK> depressing first time screenplay the lead performances are incredibly intense and the film features absolutely fantastic turns from hoffman hawke and finney but the truly greatest wonder of the film is that three years after he won a lifetime achievement oscar much <UNK> as the ultimate sign of retirement in the film business sidney lumet proves that he still has the immense talent to deliver a truly wonderful <UNK> intense piece of cinema reminiscent of his golden years
<START> this movie has some of the worst acting that i have ever seen some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor this nail trap catches these bad guys the rest of the movie <UNK> as you go i can't believe that this movie is not even in the bottom 100 movies of all time i also can't believe that there are sequels the next crap movie that i want to watch is r o t o r could r o t o r really be much worse than this br br
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is a film about a major who makes life a living hell for his small group of boys in the marines this film does not really have a lot to offer but it provides several hilarious moments that are well worth a watch don't expect it to be a memorable film however just expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people the confrontation between major payne and the <UNK> boy were hilarious and that's really all i remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on major payne again it is not a great film and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter
<START> i have never commented on a film before i watched this movie with my girlfriend last night i've read comments saying this movie stays with you it does it's been almost 24 hours and i am still completely affected this movie left me questioning my own self how can i possibly compare myself to a character such as ben who is totally <UNK> i loved this movie i love movies that keep me guessing and wondering until the end i feel two emotions <UNK> happiness and sadness an amazing feel good movie and a very sad one too i so wanted ben and emily to be together but in the end they were forever if you haven't seen this movie get it and watch it just make sure you have no <UNK> you'll want to see every nuance in this picture one for my library
<START> strangely this version of open your eyes is more mature and more nuanced aided by <UNK> <UNK> screenplay is a lot <UNK> and more fleshed out than <UNK> original the spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first but there's no doubt that <UNK> has improved on it if just slightly notice that you have no idea what the lead did in open your eyes but you know almost everything about the lead in vanilla sky that's what i mean by more fleshed out
<START> which do you think the average person would know more less about iranian cinema or iranian football interestingly the two come to the <UNK> of controversial iranian filmmaker <UNK> <UNK> latest film entitled <UNK> a tale that uses football or access to football as a backdrop for a series of scenes revolving around one's right to do something or go somewhere and an <UNK> right to <UNK> that courtesy if and when they'd like to the odd thing is you don't come away from <UNK> having <UNK> about iranian football or too much about iranian cinema unless it's an education in <UNK> controversial style but you do come away feeling <UNK> that at least someone from iran has taken a controversial issue that is clearly still very much in force in a nation like iran and is willing to present it to an international audience rather than exploit it br br i can remember the 2006 world cup i'm sure many people can it was the summer after my initial year out at university and after the <UNK> that was my first year a summer of world cup football acted as a nicely timed <UNK> needless to say i saw practically every game bar the ones they show simultaneously with the other ones at the very end of the group stages so that to avoid <UNK> as seen in spain <UNK> when it was thought west germany and <UNK> <UNK> to get a result between them that would see them both through at the expense of <UNK> br br anyone in britain that was watching the <UNK> broadcast of the iran ¬ñ mexico game both <UNK> first of the <UNK> may remember that at the top of the show the <UNK> football anchorman gary <UNK> let off a <UNK> comment to introduce the match it went something like <UNK> seen giants germany england <UNK> and holland play but now we get to see mexico and iran battle it <UNK> the emphasis on the latter two being inferior was clear and that maybe watching them was a chore it's a shame because there are people and films like <UNK> present them who are really willing to see iran play to the point where they risk their well being to achieve it and it's sad when people in a position of power dismiss what they <UNK> <UNK> when there are others who'd do anything to have the chance to otherwise engage br br when immediately thinking of the words <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> my mind flies back to the france <UNK> game between said nation and america here is a film about a world cup game of sorts involving iran but where some or indeed most iranian filmmakers may well have <UNK> to present a tale revolving around <UNK> famous victory over the united states and what that meant to them director <UNK> chooses to look at what goes on behind the scenes and presents a story from the stands as women are <UNK> from football matches and are not allowed to live the ecstasy of winning a game of immense <UNK> you can imagine a heavy handed film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> propaganda film designed to exploit as they <UNK> a western power or <UNK> at a sport they perhaps were not expected to do so in br br a couple of films that spring to mind when it comes to beating the <UNK> at their own game are 2001 indian film <UNK> in which the indian <UNK> defeat the <UNK> british at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 'the game of their <UNK> sees the americans defeat the english at a football match only this time in the 1950 world cup the differences between these films and <UNK> are immense <UNK> is looking at a situation behind a <UNK> mentality and <UNK> to explore an essence of <UNK> as the girls trying to see their beloved iran defeat <UNK> and qualify for the world cup are rounded up like animals and kept in a crude <UNK> mere feet from a <UNK> window that would allow them to see the game the reasoning is to do with the foul language the men <UNK> not will but <UNK> use during the game the film presents iran as so incompetent that they cannot take away a man's right to swear and <UNK> the bad language but must <UNK> a woman's right to see the game all together ¬ñ it is no wonder <UNK> film was itself banned in iran br br but <UNK> remembers to include what makes the rule so crazy in the first place by frequently allowing his female characters to both smoke <UNK> and use mobile phones two things the doctors and scientists will have you think are far more dangerous to the human body mind than hearing a little bit of foul language at a football match <UNK> pays special attention to the title of his film <UNK> which itself is a <UNK> within football <UNK> when an <UNK> is <UNK> trying to gain an advantage in the field of play the parallels run with the <UNK> position in the film as these <UNK> supposedly without right individuals are caught trying to put one over the opposition team that being the state itself br br i think <UNK> is one of the better films to come out of the middle east and surrounding <UNK> area that i've seen it's a tense but <UNK> film about people who do not carry any acting history according to the imdb and thus the acting is raw and real adding that quaint neo <UNK> aura to it all the immediate ending is haunting and the constant verbal battle between the male soldiers and female wrong <UNK> who <UNK> to defy the state is wonderful i also think for anyone to actually dislike the film for the reasons i've mentioned shows a distinct level of <UNK> either that or you work in the iranian government
<START> this is really films outside not in a motel room with real costumes not only strings and <UNK> you have to see this movie it's the only porn movie i know that is worth watching between the sex scenes br br bon cinema br br <UNK>
<START> first of all i don't understand why some people find this movie so anti american sure there are moments when the u s are accused directly like at the segments of <UNK> <UNK> ken <UNK> and to a certain extent mira <UNK> but come on they aren't naive <UNK> instead they are based on real and documented facts and all the documents that the cia released about <UNK> <UNK> this for example br br but returning to the film itself what i enjoyed most on it is the variety of <UNK> we find in it we find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day we find common people that have their feelings <UNK> on the shadow of the events of september 11 and react differently to this with dignity or frustration we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness br br all these visions and others as powerful as these or even more make a consistent blend and help the <UNK> to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world <UNK> to the events of september <UNK> thus what we see is a <UNK> that is much more complex than whites and blacks and this may make some people <UNK> but this is the world where we live and in it there is no place for <UNK> <UNK> regardless of what <UNK> or priests may say us br br finally i think it's a shame that there isn't even a release date for this movie in the united states of america it's a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened and this movie could give some clues to them this film puts very clearly differently of what some people of this forum think that everything we do today will determine our future and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today
<START> if you're going to look after a child make sure they don't live anywhere near a graveyard especially if said kid has a habit of drawing gory pictures and disappears at night among the <UNK> to see her <UNK> but our long haired heroine oblivious to all the signs <UNK> up with her family the <UNK> which include a strict father and a <UNK> older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the <UNK> tendency to talk even when their lips aren't moving and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths but enough of that domestic animals are being sacrificed old ladies are having <UNK> torn out and the orchestra won't shut up during any scene even the quiet ones oh and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film <UNK> on br br in fact it would been better if everybody involved had taken a <UNK> <UNK> what they'd signed up for and gone <UNK> yes i know it's hard to get into movies these days but this sort of <UNK> point is not one on your <UNK> you'd want if would be like a <UNK> farm <UNK> having a conviction for chicken <UNK> featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill laurel <UNK> and another almost equally as bad by the charisma free child actress <UNK> cole the next <UNK> fanning she ain't the film <UNK> on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax br br this involves five or six members of the undead <UNK> our utterly useless heroine in a shed while her bit of rough <UNK> off these <UNK> with a <UNK> of wood a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on but back up a minute earlier on they were in the car and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so <UNK> they <UNK> off at the sound of it so do they stay where they are safe no of course not they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere so the bloke can prove what a <UNK> he is the girl can act like she's having a nervous breakdown br br finally the film <UNK> it doesn't end it just goes to a <UNK> halt the main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood as if nothing horrible had happened but my dear viewer something horrible has happened you have just sat through one of the most <UNK> boring horror films you're ever likely to see and lost <UNK> minutes of your life you'll never get back just think years from now on your <UNK> what you'd trade an hour and 22 minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family sadly it's already too late for me don't you make the same mistake 2 10
<START> just okay horror film about a nice suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and the thing in the basement that they keep feeding people they pick up off the street of course there is more to it then that but to say more would be telling br br for me this just didn't come together as it tries to have it two ways both as a family drama and a horror film the film tries very hard to walk the cutting edge between the two genres but seems more to stumble all over the place as it tries to be shocking something it never really is it doesn't help that the final revelation is less a scare then an oh as on oh thats it maybe if i hadn't been watching so many horror films recently this might have been better or it may have just seemed it since i wouldn't have compared it to so much br br i'd take a pass
<START> this is high grade cheese fare of b movie kung fu flicks bruce wannabe lee is played by bruce li i think of course let's show quick clips of bruce and do closeups of his eyes and if you <UNK> at the right angle during a certain time of the day during the winter <UNK> it kind of looks like bruce you'll laugh in awe at how the film <UNK> isn't very good but some cool deleted scenes from enter the dragon are thrown in the mix according to the movie bruce lee was killed by a <UNK> while hanging from a helicopter of course they think this can excuse bruce li for trying to be bruce even though his character is supposed to be <UNK> brother who for some reason still <UNK> <UNK> gestures and fighting style very poorly see bruce go one on one with the cowardly lion the props department stopped by kay <UNK> you see bruce also finds nothing wrong with <UNK> beating up a crippled man towards the end the director decided let's throw a flashback for a scene just shown 3 minutes ago they must've thought that only one <UNK> <UNK> with attention <UNK> disorder could fully understand this film br br
<START> this was an awful movie not for the subject matter but for the delivery i went with my girlfriend at the time when the movie came out expecting to see a movie about the triumph of the human spirit over <UNK> what we saw was 2 hours of brutal police <UNK> with no <UNK> at the end the previews and ads made no mention of this plus for all that they played up whoopi goldberg my <UNK> is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes again the previews say nothing about this not that you would expect that but it's just more of the problem if i had known how depressing this movie would be i would've never have seen it or at least i would've been prepared for it this was a bait and switch ad campaign and i will never see this movie again
<START> an uptight <UNK> who wants to commit suicide encounters a free spirited bad seed who has 5 weeks to live and then they're off to discover america get the idea there's not an original moment in this whole movie
<START> on the back <UNK> for years so it was reported this television reunion of two of the most beloved characters in sitcom history started off badly and went straight downhill from there mary richards mary tyler moore and her best friend <UNK> <UNK> valerie <UNK> meet in new york after a long <UNK> and catch up on each other's lives what a novel concept but sad to relate nothing worth talking about let alone making a movie about has happened to either of them in the <UNK> years so instead the script <UNK> itself with throwing out one <UNK> old plot device after another most having to do with older women in the <UNK> while completely missing the quirky charm and sophistication that made the original show a winner the supporting cast is instantly forgettable the humor is nonexistent and the chemistry which moore and <UNK> once had together is gone moore allegedly <UNK> this project for years waiting for just the right script before committing herself if this was the one she considered right what on earth were the ones she turned down like it's not the age of the characters that does this in for time inevitably <UNK> on but the almost complete lack of imagination coupled with a blatant disregard for the elements that made the series work at one time this was intended as a pilot but all to obviously it failed to generate any interest among potential <UNK> or for that matter among potential audiences quickly and mercifully forgotten the film is a travesty and an insult to a classic
<START> we start all of our reviews with the following information my wife and i have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years recently we were <UNK> by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost so we can see whatever we want whenever we want the point of this is that critics count for zero your local critics or the national critics like ebert are really no different than you or me the only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not therefore it is our belief that if you get your <UNK> worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us we never ever listen or read the critics we only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us well enough about that br br this movie is very good not just good but very good the critics are a bunch of morons just because there is nudity and language they hated it it was worth the price of ticket and that is all you can ask for is that not right every movie cannot be an academy award <UNK> sharon stone is gorgeous and does a great job in the movie and it <UNK> me as to what in the hell the critics want
<START> robert <UNK> is teaching a class of film students at new york university in manhattan new york br br he covers <UNK> of history and truths that are no longer generally known i would like to see much more of this show it is very entertaining mr <UNK> uses examples and show and tell to get his points across he explained that the person who actually <UNK> the midnight ride of paul <UNK> was not paul <UNK> henry <UNK> <UNK> used <UNK> name because it sounded better br br i've watched robert <UNK> for many years from the time he was doing stand up comedy and all the way through <UNK> on hbo he's a good actor and a good stand up comedian but he's an excellent teacher i highly recommend that you watch an episode of this show it is well worth your time
<START> i have screened this movie several times here at college and every time i show it the number of people watching with me grows <UNK> in addition to the <UNK> anyone i've already shown it to needs to see it again it takes a little while to get into it but by the end the whole room is screaming shouting yelling <UNK> scenes repeatedly repeating dialogue and just totally and completely <UNK> in the <UNK> experience that is pia <UNK> in the lonely lady scene after scene after scene of the most <UNK> filmed poorly written horribly acted trash is thrown at you in an all out assault that ranks as the <UNK> thing i own no small statement friends for me nothing <UNK> 2 u pia and i don't suppose i'm the only one who's ever felt this way
<START> this film is shockingly underrated on imdb like so many films this isn't <UNK> but it's a reasonably good if predictable dance competition personal growth film if you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 mile for a female step dancer than i think you'll like it br br judging from the imdb ratings my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250 and was vote bombed with many <UNK> as happens to so many films that aren't about the mob don't have special effects or include non white or non straight characters br br it's an american film but it's not a us film set mostly in toronto the <UNK> are subtle and some audiences may think it's set entirely in the us just because the final competition is in the border city of detroit br br i liked the music i liked the dance but not convinced it's worth 50 000 but what do i know the characters were easy on the eyes br br i do agree the title sucks i don't remember anyone in the film saying those words and it should have an s no it's not a foreign language br br there's not a lot to hate about this film and let's be honest a vote of 1 means you hated it so i can only assume that it's an expression of hate for the kind of people in it and that's sad
<START> disney the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years films like tarzan and the <UNK> new groove have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song driven routine of disney's past and into new <UNK> territory atlantis is the <UNK> step yet but we have to remember this is still disney the first ever serious film to come out of disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them in fact it's so serious it makes it into pg territory perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer br br but despite the more mature subject matter this is still a film that disney wanted to draw in the families with not just mature audiences so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand but interesting enough to take it away from the <UNK> of the little mermaid et al br br so what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot unfortunately suffering the blow of being <UNK> into a <UNK> minute movie ultimately this is an action film about atlantis not about the exposition <UNK> it so we are <UNK> through the first half hour with as many sequences <UNK> the screen as is possible without losing <UNK> suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point a to point b so quickly you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of hollywood if you want epic levels of detail in the plot turn to james <UNK> titanic both films feature a boat in some manner br br and let's talk about love shall we yes as with a lot of films the lead male one milo <UNK> a bumbling <UNK> and lead female <UNK> the clich√©d <UNK> princess are set to fall in love with each other but what i found was not as clich√©d as i was expecting by film's end for once the characters touching feeling kissing sequence was far more subdued there's various points in the film where the attraction grows but it's just not in the <UNK> of say the little mermaid a good thing br br you may have <UNK> that this is a rather clich√©d film correct you have your leading hero and heroine backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition all being given their moments during the film numerous other characters appear take up the few minutes of <UNK> then disappear it doesn't take a genius to do the <UNK> ¬ñ a <UNK> minute film with a focus on action and visuals and with a considerable cast has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent so what does it rely on clich√©s and lots of them every character <UNK> something that has been done a thousand times before you have the bumbling scientist the attractive princess the square <UNK> colonel the rich eccentric the <UNK> <UNK> the russian femme fatale ¬ñ need i go on br br i don't know why this got to anyone ¬ñ i found the tongue in cheek nature of this film quite amusing alright this is meant to be a serious flick but do you really expect disney to give up every single <UNK> of their history at least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue and sometimes it even is a little inspired br br but in the end it's those big stunning visuals that put the <UNK> on this cake the cgi animation is truly amazing in places and doesn't dwarf the characters which was a flaw that let the recent <UNK> a e down speaking of characters disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs bringing an anime style to the film <UNK> the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime much more so than any previous disney outing this resulted in a conflict with fans of the japanese anime <UNK> for the film's overall similarities with said cartoon series having not seen this anime i can't comment br br with picture there is sound gary <UNK> heads up the sound team and what a soundtrack from the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat james <UNK> howard treats us to a dynamic musical score which <UNK> the film in every way never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or <UNK> it br br perhaps i missed the point of what the creators intended to me the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride albeit with a more serious tone than any disney film before it if you don't like the clich√©d tongue in cheek attitude then perhaps the effort that has been <UNK> into the visuals will delight heck at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other disney efforts <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br this is a positive 10 out of 10 review from someone who was blown away by this film i always suspend my disbelief with any animated film ¬ñ after all the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium so sit back enjoy the ride and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film
<START> to make a film <UNK> the <UNK> and the real star wars trilogy would tax even a great film maker mr lucas is not that film maker br br to portray the fall of a good man into darkness needs a good actor mr christensen is not that actor br br the first 60 80 minutes are <UNK> boring with only a few <UNK> of yet more light <UNK> fights but there is a lack of edge because you already know which main characters survive to the original star wars br br count <UNK> christopher lee has a very fleeting role here and about the best idea is to have jar jar <UNK> silent br br no the film only picks up with the <UNK> turning on the jedi and has one great overlong sequence at the <UNK> falls
<START> some people don't like the animation personally i think the animation was quite remarkable given when this movie was done there are lots of older cartoons that i just love my problems with this movie are not the animation but basically the way it was constructed the characters are all just well goofy and for this movie they shouldn't be apparently everyone in lotr has a <UNK> problem for starters just the way they acted in general annoyed me my two sisters and i were laughing through most of this movie i think that if many people had seen this before seeing the newer ones they wouldn't have gone i'm glad i rented this and didn't buy it there are few movies that give me a headache this was one of them however this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen although it ranks up there or down there depending on your view
<START> i bought this dvd after seeing it highly <UNK> here it's just a short 20 minutes zombie film nothing special about it except for the music perhaps br br don't buy it not even really worth spending 20 minutes to see it only if you're really bored
<START> if it wasn't for the bad dialogues and script i mean the direction was really in touch with it's subject the actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life but in the end the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together i would highly suggest not to watch this unless you're a al pacino <UNK> like i am and will watch everything he is playing in even if the result lately are rather poor this is after <UNK> a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles
<START> i enjoyed the night <UNK> very much it's one of the better movies of the summer br br robin williams gives one of his best performances in fact the entire cast was very good all played just the right notes for their characters not too much and not too little sandra oh adds a wonderful comic touch toni collette is great as the mom and never goes over the top everyone is very believable br br it's a short movie just under an hour and a half i noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the sundance version i wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the movie br br the director told a story and did it in straightforward fashion which is a refreshing change from many directors these days who seem to think their job is to impress the audience rather than tell a story and tell it well br br do not be sucker <UNK> by the previews and ads it is not a <UNK> thriller see the night <UNK> because you want to see a good story told well if you go expecting hitchcock you will be disappointed br br my only complaint with the movie was the ending the director could have left a little more to the audience's imagination but this is a minor <UNK>
<START> though i saw this movie years ago its impact has never left me stephen <UNK> depiction of an <UNK> is deep and moving his anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is <UNK> everyone in the cast is amazing from sutherland who tries to <UNK> him and provide ways for the police to <UNK> their efforts to the troubled citizen x each day when we are <UNK> with stories of mass murderers i think of this film and the <UNK> work the people do who try to find the killers
<START> well our standards have gone into the toilet the direction was poor the acting was mediocre and the writing was amateurish and those are the good points hopefully there won't be a sequel otherwise i might have to leave the country
<START> william russ is the main character throughout this made for tv movie he left his family behind to only <UNK> and begin paying off his <UNK> but he tries to keep away from his family thats where peter falk <UNK> comes in playing several different roles to convince him to come home br br the story is average and they actually managed to get a former star peter falk and use him to a fairly nice degree but william russ wasn't truly a star however it appears his acting is still ok br br i found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable in fact the last 20 minutes i could almost <UNK> word for word before it happened a good movie should never be like that br br overall it was a sub par movie in a letter <UNK> system it would receive a d
<START> positively awful george sanders vehicle where he goes from being a thief to police <UNK> br br while sanders was an excellent character actor he was certainly no leading man and this film proves it br br it is absolutely beyond stupidity gene <UNK> did provide some comic relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his gun with tragedy resulting br br sadly george sanders and co star carol <UNK> committed suicide in real life after making a film as <UNK> as this it is not shocking br br the usual appealing <UNK> <UNK> is really nothing here
<START> a friend and i went through a phase some alot of years ago of <UNK> the <UNK> horror films in the video shop for an <UNK> entertainment for some reason i ended up buying this one probably v v cheap br br the cheap <UNK> soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre there's also a few very amusing scenes among them is a scene where a man's being attacked and <UNK> himself with a number of unlikely objects it made me laugh at the time doesn't seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you go br br apart from that it's total crap mind you but probably worth a watch if you like films like <UNK> mall yes i've seen that too
<START> it breaks my heart that this movie is not appreciated as it should be its very underrated people forgot what movies are really about nowadays they only think about bum bum movies which can be quite fun watching with popcorn and friends like transformers movies which are oriented with hyper mega high budget like <UNK> or even higher on special effects only and which are dumb movies without storyline its the kind of a movie what i despite most of course it is fun watching greatly made <UNK> but we do not gain anything essential from that kind of movies br br i honestly think that performance was excellent especially busy <UNK> alongside with erika christensen and victor <UNK> whom i respect made this movie an oscar worth emotional performance by busy <UNK> was astonishing its such a shame we wont see oscar in her hands which she deserves
<START> as a forty something urban <UNK> photography and longtime fan of the original kolchak night stalker series since my early childhood one aspect that hasn't really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration <UNK> character <UNK> during the series he always managed to get himself in to one great <UNK> <UNK> or tunnel after another armed with only his <UNK> <UNK> okay so he had some <UNK> in the primal ape episode tunnel and his camera he never carried any other gear to either protect himself or make the exploration easier br br like many here i recently purchased the dvd box set of the two pilot movies and subsequent tv episodes and have been slowly <UNK> all the shows and although i remember watching them back in the early 70s when they first aired its been over 30 years passed so many of them seem new all over again campy dated and cheesy but charming and highly entertaining they just don't make stuff like this these days now its all <UNK> spin offs with predictable characters and plots br br thankfully my 16 <UNK> old daughter has been sitting down to watch the episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them she enjoys the genre it gives me hope and faith the series will carry on to new generations of fans for years to come
<START> in my mind the best of the ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time the theme of workers v management with lots of talk of <UNK> and rights perhaps dates the film a bit now as it's no longer a subject discussed all that much but that doesn't stop white suit from being a show stopping classic br br the plot about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the <UNK> industry into turmoil doesn't sound exciting when written down but the film <UNK> that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true ealing comedy the fabric <UNK> dirt and can never wear out the titular white suit that alec guinness wears throughout the second half becomes the <UNK> for several iconic images and sequences such as guinness being able to use his <UNK> thread to scale a sheer wall the script itself is full of dry wit is he all right yes pity and characterisation is first rate i'm always <UNK> by the wonderful direction in these films as well comedies of later <UNK> would adopt a point the camera at the actors and let it roll mentality but the ealing films always attempted interesting lighting and angles and <UNK> this film is no exception br br of course it's the cast that lifts the material to <UNK> heights alec guinness gives a fantastically understated performance with eyes that convey wonder joy and <UNK> defeat whenever the story demands it <UNK> is a man oblivious to everything except his work such an <UNK> character could quickly have become boring or irritating but guinness effortlessly makes him likable so much so that the closing stages of the film generate a real sense of urgency as <UNK> tries to come out on top in a world that wants to bury everything he's ever worked for joan <UNK> plays another of her strong female roles and is an absolute delight to watch as usual as are <UNK> cecil parker and slimy michael <UNK> everybody gets laughs without even trying to it's comical british understatement at its finest br br the man in the white suit is <UNK> minutes of sheer brilliance with a great plot great cast <UNK> wit and healthy <UNK> of cynicism absolutely top notch
<START> complete waste of time this movie is not comedy it's not drama it's not romance not even teenage comedy at least story it should be some turn over one end but it's so disappointing when movie has a turn over on end i expect that turn over to make movie even better <UNK> fight club but this turn over makes movie even worse when i watch teenage comedy and i don't do that very often i expect lousy jokes and bunch of <UNK> jokes are too lousy and there is no nudity you got only one very good looking i must admit girl and that's that and she's fully dressed whole movie acting is bad like soap series don't waste your time there are <UNK> with better story and acting br br sorry on my bad english
<START> when i spotted that <UNK> <UNK> and ricky <UNK> were in the same movie i was like score i admit i was eager to see the movie and i have to say the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way then it went all down hill i didn't expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights <UNK> <UNK> they took every possible controversial topic and threw it into one stupid story i was appalled that <UNK> was involved in anything of the sort especially his role nobody with a fully <UNK> brain would actually accept all that crap about the vietnam war if anyone really wants to know how communism was like sit down and read a book on it and not one that <UNK> it or is against it just the cold hard facts br br i only watched a few scenes here and there only because i wanted to see <UNK> body but that was all that interested me everything else about this movie irritated me
<START> spoilers although none that aren't revealed in the first two minutes of the movie br br robin williams is actually quite good in this as the friendly lonely emotionally <UNK> loser <UNK> he makes a very human even sympathetic psycho and really disappears into the character no small feat for such a recognizable performer br br too bad the rest of the movie is such a waste the supporting performances and performers wouldn't look out of place in a soft core porno it doesn't help that every character but <UNK> is made of 100 cardboard at times the director actually seems to be trying to <UNK> suspense we know from the very first moments a that <UNK> is a complete <UNK> job b that he survives and c that he gets <UNK> by the cops at the end so all we're left to <UNK> is the <UNK> and the <UNK> and the answers provided aren't all that interesting br br the plot is plodding and contrived and features some nonsensical moments for instance the husband <UNK> his wife for her expensive tastes even though she seems to spend all her free time at the local <UNK> <UNK> about two thirds of the way through <UNK> does something so <UNK> stupid that it makes one wonder how much he actually cares about his grand revenge scheme and the final clich√©d explanation of his <UNK> right out of <UNK> tom ' is a terrible <UNK> br br the dialogue is of the absolute worst sort it's not <UNK> or awkward or unbelievable or bad in any other way that could be considered fun even for bad movie lovers instead every line is purely <UNK> <UNK> it's as if the director handed a plot outline to a newspaper <UNK> and said hey i need a <UNK> script on this in an hour ' it made me want to scream honestly br br this movie seems to be a <UNK> to the suburban beware the help thrillers of the eighties and nineties the hand that rocks the cradle ' e g and while it's certainly unpleasant it's never really scary <UNK> <UNK> occasionally makes you feel uncomfortable but on its own that's not enough to make the film work in the end lack of <UNK> from everyone involved except robin williams sinks this one 3 out of 10
