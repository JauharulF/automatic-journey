<START> this movie should be required viewing for all <UNK> or would be <UNK> all of the best lines are directly related to <UNK> the public library vs academic library argument is a classic argument <UNK> among <UNK> and library school students it also breaks many <UNK> stereotypes <UNK> might even be capable of having fun even if they don't usually have sex in the romance languages section the best movie about <UNK> desk set with <UNK> hepburn and spencer tracy of course
<START> this wasn't what i wanted to see i bought this on dvd and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a moment br br <UNK> what i didn't like br br 1 they were shooting at the father br br 2 the <UNK> was really annoying br br 3 the dinosaurs mostly looked to <UNK> br br 4 the bad scientist well he was annoying br br 5 the picture quality on the dvd was really bad br br what i did like br br 1 the music by jerry <UNK> this music is really great i have the <UNK> soundtrack from this movie sadly the sound quality is not good but its ok for its time br br 2 the first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire a sort of awe br br 3 baby is kinda cute when he is in the water and is playing br br 4 that funny scene with the <UNK> br br 5 the children who sees this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses
<START> this is quite possibly the worst movie of all time it stars <UNK> <UNK> and is about a <UNK> genie apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got <UNK> into <UNK> out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece the movie gets 1 out of 10
<START> the return of <UNK> is notable if one can say that for the casting of bela lugosi as the hero rather than the villain why he even gets the girl br br the story as such involves the black magic cult of <UNK> trying to capture the last egyptian princess <UNK> the <UNK> maria alba and use her as a sacrifice as a means of <UNK> their ancient leader who just happens to look like <UNK> lugosi as <UNK> who possesses magical powers tries to <UNK> the villains br br director ray taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage fans of king kong 1933 will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep kong at bay in several scenes the acting is for the most part awful the actor who plays the high priest i believe <UNK> <UNK> for example uses that acting coach inspired <UNK> that was so common in the early <UNK> the less said about the others the better br br it is a mystery why lugosi accepted parts in independent <UNK> at this stage of his career because he was still a <UNK> star at universal at this time maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl who knows as his career started to spiral <UNK> in the late 30s this kind of fare would become the norm for lugosi rather than the exception br br
<START> oh dear this movie could have been sub titled when writers go on strike what a stinker i had really high hopes for this mostly after reading imdb reviews which makes me wonder about the whole imdb rating system but that's a separate matter i loved steve <UNK> in anchorman bruce almighty the office etc so i was expecting great things to say i was disappointed is the understatement of the year there are so many things wrong with this movie but i'll <UNK> myself to a the <UNK> of any family behaving like these people do a mass <UNK> <UNK> what planet is that real life on the clunky script a murderer of love please and the fact that the character of dan is so unlikable you find yourself wondering what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him this movie was filled to <UNK> with clunky dialogue <UNK> direction ridiculous set scenes and it was slow slow slow we would have walked out after half an hour if we'd not been with my parents who don't get out much and don't like to waste money unlike the makers of this movie who would have been better off throwing all the cash spent making this movie into a <UNK> that would have been more entertaining if you like movies avoid this like the plague
<START> although i recently put this on my 10 worst films list i have to say it's probably no worse than burt reynolds in the <UNK> or any of the look who's talking sequels still it's pretty nauseating even with sexy drew barrymore playing something of a horror movie answer to holly <UNK> <UNK> from new york city to los angeles but finding out she's being stalked by a murderous look alike poor sally <UNK> a quirky actress of great acclaim in the '70s is reduced here to a <UNK> supporting role and <UNK> leading man george <UNK> is the worst type of sitcom actor always <UNK> for a laugh after every line the picture is <UNK> but <UNK> bloody shower scene boasts <UNK> and the identity of the psycho although right out of a scooby doo episode is interesting but as for the finale get real who had to clean up that mess from
<START> a fashion designer <UNK> over a cat and falls into a pool hitting her head on something floating on the surface with rather cheesy effects this was a tv movie she <UNK> up out of her body she <UNK> through a tunnel of rings of <UNK> orange smoke and black rigid figures tip into her view they look like the <UNK> in her apartment i almost thought i was watching a jess franco movie as her friends revive her a black arm grabs her by the <UNK> and she has to struggle to get loose when she is <UNK> she remembers everything and has a nasty <UNK> on her <UNK> br br shortly thereafter she nearly gets hit by an out of control car that comes up on the sidewalk behind her on halloween she decides with her boyfriend to go to mexico for a vacation when she gets there she's surprised to find it's the day of the dead they're annoyed by another american tourist who keeps following them and he almost <UNK> them br br the designer is encouraged to join a group of people who've had near death experiences they've all experienced the tunnel but not the black figures or the repeated near escapes from death one of them has and he's very anxious she's also encouraged to meet with a psychic br br a doctor tells her about people he calls <UNK> the name of the novel this was based on they're people who supposedly died of one cause that when examined prove to have died of another cause thus it's like they continued walking around after dying until they died again but he blames it on poor record keeping br br i watched this on the <UNK> minute video and it felt awfully long i can't imagine that there's actually a <UNK> minute version perhaps if it was meant to be watched over two or more nights on tv it would better be watched that way than in one sitting br br i've only read one gary <UNK> novel <UNK> and if it is representative of his work he's not the most original of writers <UNK> had the common plot of picked on kid kills people in revenge even the variation was pretty common picked on kid dies and kills people years later in revenge from beyond the grave and in fact it has a point in common with this movie in that the kid practices <UNK> projection and when he is drowned he <UNK> up out of his body as here i don't know how closely from the dead of night follows his novel <UNK> i understand the howling movies don't bear much resemblance to his novels br br it's quite a slow movie and the special effects and cinematography are really held down by the presumably low budget and made for tv shortcomings there are a lot of easily recognizable character actors in it it also feels very dated more early to mid 1980s than 1989 i found it to be boring a much better low budget movie covering similar subject matter that i don't think has dated as badly is sole survivor 1983 arguably the inspiration for the <UNK> final destination movies it blows from the dead of night away
<START> i watched this film not really expecting much i got it in a pack of 5 films all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a <UNK> so what could i expect and you know what i was right they were all terrible this movie has a few and a few is <UNK> it interesting points the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch the drummer is very like a drummer i e damned annoying and well thats about it actually the problem is that its just so boring in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious i had my thumb on the fast forward button ready to press for most of the movie but gave it a go and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking <UNK> they don't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot i thought he looked a bit like a <UNK> all this and i haven't even mentioned the killer i'm not even gonna go into it its just not worth explaining anyway as far as i'm concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london who was actually quite funny it wasn't because of their acting talent i've certainly seen a lot worse but i've also seen a lot better best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry
<START> i'm a huge fan of <UNK> <UNK> i loved evolution and who didn't like <UNK> from the trailer you already know that <UNK> character will get dumped by <UNK> so the build up is obviously towards the moment when she <UNK> her <UNK> on him but the pay off is just not there the shark <UNK> did manage to get a slight giggle but once again it was all in the trailer br br no one does breathless quite like uma and luke is <UNK> owen on his good days if not for <UNK> wilson you would sit there with a <UNK> smile until your <UNK> start to <UNK> this is a comedy right br br it's not awful it just sits there like a stale cracker behind the <UNK> this could have been such a brilliant send up of superhero movies and <UNK> but fails on both counts let's see if jason <UNK> can salvage the family name
<START> not a bad word to say about this film really i wasn't initially impressed by it but it grew on me quickly i like it a lot and i think its a shame that many people can't see past the fact that it was banned in some <UNK> mine being one of them the film delivers in the shock gore and atmosphere department the score is a beautiful piece of suspense delivering <UNK> it only seems fair that chris young went on to be one of the best <UNK> in the business the acting in this film is of a somewhat high standard if a little wooden in some spots and the effects are very real and gritty all of this is high praise for a good slasher film in my book i've noted in some reviews that the film has gotten serious <UNK> having the famous killer's p o v shot and i ask what's wrong with that it is a classic shot that evokes dread into any good fan of the genre and is a great to keep the killer's identity a secret the only thing that stops this film getting top marks in my book is that the surprise twist killer revealed is not handled with more care i mean it just happens kind of quickly though the great performances make it just about credible aside from that pranks is a great movie though i prefer the original title and its a shame that so many people knock it off as just a cheap piece of crap its more than that but only few know that as it seems to have gotten lost in the <UNK> of early 80s slasher what a shame its a really good movie people believe me
<START> house of games is a <UNK> constructed film and one of the few films i have seen that had me <UNK> at the screen in <UNK> at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger <UNK> review which <UNK> it the best film of 1987 i had my doubts mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year boy was i in for a surprise this was one of the <UNK> most well written movies i had ever seen br br the screenplay is quite a piece of work not only in terms of the plot which twists and turns and pulls the <UNK> out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out but also in terms of character development on my second viewing i began to realize that <UNK> screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations the climax of the movie is particularly effective because it is absolutely inevitable it <UNK> naturally from what we know about the characters and it is therefore much more than just an <UNK> twist ending the performances by lindsay <UNK> and joe <UNK> also add enormously to the film i cannot picture any other actor besides <UNK> playing the role of mike and <UNK> plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset their work plus <UNK> extraordinary screenplay combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980's it is truly a must see
<START> even though i'm quite young the beatles are my absolutely favourite band i never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since i can remember br br it's the sort of film that is worth trying the once i can see why it wasn't released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the tv i was <UNK> through my tv guide and happened to see this film it didn't much details except something like <UNK> lennon and paul <UNK> meet after the beatles have broken up jared harris <UNK> i'd never heard of him he played john or <UNK> quinn who played paul however they are certainly <UNK> actors br br the film had a slow start but as it developed i could see how well quinn but especially harris played their characters as a huge fan i sort of know what the real lennon and <UNK> are like the script was brilliant and harris got <UNK> accent personality and mannerisms spot on quinn played <UNK> quite well but sometimes went into his irish accent the make up artists made them look excellent br br this paragraph may be counted as a spoiler br br as i mentioned before it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film i found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians as for <UNK> rude line in the italian restaurant totally unnecessary the ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever i watch it br br it is quite different from the other <UNK> films i've seen where it's about how the beatles got together and became famous and those never really did the characters that well e g <UNK> br br in conclusion i would say if you're a beatles or john lennon or paul <UNK> fan give it a chance you may have <UNK> surprise at only about 95 minutes long it's worth waiting for the film to develop br br if anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the <UNK> <UNK> for this film i'd be very interested
<START> possible spoilers perhaps i must say that cinderella ii dreams come true is one of the worst movies ever made first of all the movie was made during the height of disney's sequel rampage it was created around the same time as the little mermaid ii the jungle book ii and peter pan ii all of which were <UNK> to their original film classics disney also made the <UNK> of <UNK> dame ii and atlantis ii but i'm going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place let me go ahead and say that i am an avid <UNK> of good disney films and i absolutely adore the original disney cinderella the sequel to cinderella however was a waste of time the character of cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that i grew up watching in the original cinderella was kind and loving the new cinderella had very out of character moments with current era <UNK> like i'm going to do this <UNK> my way let me also tell you that new cinderella as i have <UNK> named her says <UNK> that is the anti cinderella i try to find the best in people but in the sequel <UNK> one of the <UNK> is good what the heck why they made it all out to be like lady <UNK> and <UNK> are just horrible family members for poor little <UNK> my question to the world did the people at disney watch the original cinderella when making this sequel well it surely doesn't seem so if i remember correctly <UNK> was just as abusive to cinderella as <UNK> and lady <UNK> i am all for redemption and forgiveness but there was no point of redemption for <UNK> in this movie in the first one <UNK> was evil in the second one she is good one just can't leave a story like this i hope disney realizes that this movie among other movies is <UNK> walt disney's name perhaps now that michael <UNK> is gone things will start <UNK> up around the house of mouse
<START> unlike the adventures of <UNK> <UNK> or big trouble in little china or conan the barbarian which are horrible films that have a certain <UNK> and self <UNK> humor that turn them into cult <UNK> the golden child is just plain bad br br the premise itself is not <UNK> and there are some funny moments but here the eddy murphy flip attitude just <UNK> any feeling of tension or danger in the story and the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension the <UNK> secrets of <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> rather than drawn upon to <UNK> br br without a feeling that anything is at stake or that the characters are faced by real danger why should we care br br who should see this film br br big fans of eddy murphy who can't help themselves br br i can't think of anyone else br br i'll give this film a 4 out of 10 for the occasional joke that worked
<START> i was impressed that i could take my 5 year old son to this movie without having to cover his ears or eyes no sex scenes no profanity and not even any violence just good entertainment enjoyable from beginning to end dennis quaid pulls off this movie very well
<START> i am very open to foreign films and like to think that i grasp what they are trying to accomplish although some things are lost in translation but the simplicity and intelligence of this film were boring i've often thought how interesting it would be to make a movie that just shows a typical day or time period that really had no point now that i've seen a movie like that i will no longer be thinking along those lines there's tones about society racism and some desire but south park has that and when i watch south park it actually moves me to feel an emotion the closest thing i felt to an emotion during this movie was the yawn i experienced after the first five minutes i rate the typical movie a seven or above because i love most every film i gave this film a one
<START> in his otherwise excellent book lincoln in american memory the <UNK> <UNK> peterson calls young mr lincoln a boring dreadful film this amazingly <UNK> analysis simply proves that great historians are rarely fine film critics i am working on a <UNK> <UNK> on abraham lincoln and <UNK> <UNK> as part of my <UNK> for writing the <UNK> i made a careful analysis of this film and of tag <UNK> brilliant interpretation of it in his <UNK> book on ford young mr lincoln comes out that culminating year of the first phase of ford's cinematic <UNK> 1939 in that greatest of hollywood years ford directed three superb still not fully appreciated films drums along the <UNK> <UNK> and young mr lincoln it might seem odd to say that <UNK> is not fully appreciated all but the most <UNK> of critics must perceive that it is one of of the greatest westerns and perhaps even one of the hundred greatest films of all time however what is not fully appreciated is that these three films work together as a kind of trilogy a <UNK> in fact ford is creating a sort of <UNK> history of america on screen drums along the <UNK> is the revolutionary war young mr lincoln is pre civil war america finally <UNK> is post civil war america what the three films have in common is that they are an extended <UNK> on the american adam and his <UNK> into the wilderness what are the psychic and social costs of american <UNK> destiny as america <UNK> to build a new human city in the wilderness lincoln <UNK> <UNK> journey as he seeks to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> law with the freedom of the wilderness young mr lincoln is not history it is full of historical <UNK> as both ford and <UNK> were well aware but myth this is lincoln the symbol of justice and mercy lincoln the man of the wilderness <UNK> to found a civilization within himself and to become the remarkable <UNK> of young america young mr lincoln is not history like james <UNK> long forgotten <UNK> about lincoln and like <UNK> biography it is an epic poem a very beautiful epic poem
<START> this one is a great one robert de niro and cuba gooding have teamed up to make a powerful and very influential film this is the true story of the first black us navy diver and the obstacles he faced in <UNK> his <UNK> at the hands of a racist master diver along the way he must also face plain old <UNK> from all of his classmates none of whom want him in their class they move out of the <UNK> when he arrives ultimately he becomes <UNK> and goes on to have a great career as a us navy diver watch this one it's a great tale of courage and honor as the story unfolds we get to watch racism slowly <UNK> and everyone begins to respect men one at a time
<START> the best martial arts movie ever made this one movie is better than anything bruce lee ever did a classic with a thoroughly entertaining and brutal climax jackie chan is the king of martial arts movies and the true king of kung fu it's a great pity that whilst bruce lee had been so overrated it took jackie chan an eternity to become popular in europe and america jackie rules
<START> i am very disappointed with k <UNK> the original good quality of k 9 doesn't exist any more this is more like a sitcom some of casts from original movie returned and got some of my memory back the captain of <UNK> now loves to hit him like a scene from old comedy show that was crazy what's the deal with the change of police it seems like they are now <UNK> not san diego <UNK> it is a completely different movie from
<START> <UNK> happens <UNK> <UNK> is a <UNK> young jane eyre and her performance is impeccable however edward rochester is supposed to be 35 white haired george c scott looks and behaves like an <UNK> 80 jane's deceased uncle is in better shape he <UNK> and <UNK> obnoxious and grim he looks like an <UNK> murderer who has sent his <UNK> out to be <UNK> we're not surprised he keeps a wife <UNK> in the attic the great love story looks like a <UNK> <UNK> nightmare there is enough darkness in the novel but <UNK> rochester is relatively young athletic powerful and charming when he chooses to be he has a fine speaking and singing voice a good mind and a conscience that he <UNK> attempts to <UNK>
<START> this film is awful the screenplay is bad the is script mediocre and even the sex scenes are worthless the thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking this movie was shot in a dark shadowy and <UNK> style a la war of the worlds which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film greg <UNK> brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film the twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here the few that do exist are simply <UNK> the only highlight is sharon <UNK> performance as catherine <UNK> <UNK> continued in this sequel but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings the only <UNK> under which a basic instinct 3 should be made would be if michael douglas agrees to join the cast
<START> the movie was awful the theater was dead with silence 'cause everyone was embarrassed to be in there watching such trash i think someone gave jet li a <UNK> and made him perform a script with dialogue written by a five year old the martial arts are <UNK> but when put next to the jackie chan movies and the matrix you're better off seeing one of those
<START> need i say its a stinker i gave it a rating of 2 br br only watch it if you suffer from insomnia br br there's plenty of scenery chewing and <UNK> it up but not much else happens in this movie there is no suspense no deep shocking secrets revealed no real threat to the <UNK> well being a few <UNK> slight raising of voices that's pretty much it the secrets are nothing that couldn't happen to anybody the last secret revealed in the film is totally predictable by that point br br the plot such as it is revolves around a young woman named faith meg <UNK> who is an artist who is hired to paint a series of <UNK> <UNK> in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very very wealthy older widowed woman and a growing mother daughter type relationship that the older woman <UNK> with her br br it turns out the older woman's daughter <UNK> is dead you can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces together br br even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two why he's still hanging around years after <UNK> death is a good question br br there's also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant a faithful butler who seems to do everything cooking cleaning serving the meal answering the door etc everything except apparently <UNK> the door since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where faith is br br there's nothing that will have you <UNK> your chair arms and <UNK> forward on the edge of your seat because there is no <UNK> tension in this film just bland pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to time br br
<START> i watched full house when i was younger and i can not understand why i did i don't remember really enjoying the show i think i and the majority of americans watching this were <UNK> by its badness it will put you in a <UNK> state and there is no going back i am still <UNK> but i try to move on i know it's a family show but that does not mean it has to be so bad the show is so cliché with every episode ending with a talk from the dad to make everyone's problems go away the characters on the show are all <UNK> there is a know it all cleaning obsessed corny father who you want to punch in the face every time he comes on screen we then have a supposed rocker uncle that is just there to look pretty for the <UNK> that have to watch this crap we have another uncle who is completely unfunny who does lame <UNK> impressions need i say more about him there is the <UNK> daughter who can not act and is always whining about something then a middle daughter who always says how rude to pretty much everything anyone says finally there is the youngest daughter michelle do not get me started on michelle played but the horrible actors known as the olsen twins if you believe in christianity i guess you would associate her with the <UNK> she is always demanding things trying too hard to be cute is constantly saying duh and rolling her eyes which makes you want to <UNK> her i am not a big fan of using a lot of physical abuse as punishment to children but in her case i would make an <UNK> she needed it on a daily basis she is the most selfish character to ever be introduced to mainstream television one example of this is when her rocker uncle is busy doing his job in the attic the brat decides to constantly annoy him and demand attention he yells at her and she gets upset poor baby the rest of the episode is <UNK> to her emotional needs and the uncle eventually <UNK> to her <UNK> the show will lower your iq along with slowly destroying your will to live i am surprised we don't hear in the news about full house being played in the background when police find people that have committed suicide do yourself a favor and do not watch reruns of the show you will thank me later
<START> what can i say i know this movie from start to finish it's hilarious it's an strong link to my past and will change the way i view film in the future <UNK> speaking the down fall there's no <UNK> johnson
<START> liked stanley <UNK> very much acting was very good story had a unique and interesting <UNK> the absence of violence and porno sex was refreshing characters were very convincing and felt like you could understand their feelings very enjoyable movie
<START> at first look of the plot <UNK> i figured it could have been a decent film could i have ever been more wrong the beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget film for the first 10 minutes you don't notice the cheesy acting horrible sound and god awful special effects but then it gets worse just about 20 minutes into it i was asking myself what was the plot again i could only ask that question when i wasn't <UNK> out laughing from the sheer <UNK> of this film the main actor has one setting for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the entire film even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything in between the flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me re live one extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie now we hit the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to rip off <UNK> from the matrix although he is doing just a horrible job the actor's talking about star wars and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable now at the end of the movie you don't realize that it's the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is finally developing the <UNK> character dies the only good thing about the movie he <UNK> a couple words and the credits roll what is this no plot bad acting cheesy everything it couldn't get any worse please if you value human decency do not watch this movie
<START> i saw the omen when i was 11 on tv i enjoyed the trilogy so when the chance to finally see one at the cinema came around i didnt pass it up i went in to the cinema knowing that what i was about to see <UNK> a cinema release but a made for tv film however being a fan i <UNK> resist but this omen movie which i saw at a midnight screening didnt bring chills it brought laughter <UNK> dialogue such as it is written that if a baby cries during <UNK> they reject there god what nonsense no decent set pieces faye grant so good in v is wasted with this script from hell no <UNK> and no fun however i did laugh out loud several times at our bad it was truly pathetic 1 out of 10
<START> just after the end of wwii powell <UNK> were asked to come up with something to try to <UNK> the <UNK> developing between the uk the usa at the time there was a lot of <UNK> over <UNK> and over here type of comments somehow they came up with this masterpiece br br my favourite movie of all time it's got everything romance poetry emotion religion drama and very quirky br br i can never explain exactly why but it hits all the right buttons and although i've seen it hundreds of times yes really i'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points throughout br br was it the magnificent acting the wonderful sets the inspired script who knows but do watch it and you'll see what i mean
<START> let me confess i found this video used and bought it because <UNK> looked so sexy in his underwear on the jacket but inside was another story besides the fact that the movie was basically a parody of invisible man genre special effects highly visible strings and other such <UNK> the script wasted no chance in fact it went out of its way in insulting all non <UNK> races and real or imagined <UNK> every insult aimed at a person in the script was either <UNK> or racist or both it starts to <UNK> on your nerves along with the shaky sound <UNK> camera style photography and melodramatic story however the end is somewhat of a surprise but by the time you get there you hardly care less too bad it could been a reasonably good movie
<START> this film <UNK> <UNK> cinematic techniques <UNK> instead of landscape capturing the attention of the camera it is small details in how someone appears how the woman may be wearing a cocktail hat and wrapped in a sheet how the husband may be wearing a hat and <UNK> and shoes and his underwear and both seem so completely at ease and comfortable how provocative the woman is <UNK> is another feature of the <UNK> that the director chooses to let us know she is a free spirit sexually and aims to get the pleasure she seeks without <UNK> directly or with any particular sensitivity to what the man may be feeling the relationship between the wife and husband is unique it is an open one <UNK> she holds nothing back feels no particular shame for how she has <UNK> and wants to share these facts with him because her primary focus always is on the fact of their marriage nothing and no one can come between the two of them only the chances of fate can <UNK> his <UNK> during the war and what follows after his return at long last a very intriguing film which is totally absorbing
<START> although i was in this movie playing the part of sheriff <UNK> it still managed to make me jump in several places and believe me i'm not that easy you might say that i'm biased about the film and ok i am but i didn't see the finished product until 12 27 2006 and was extremely pleased i'm not a horror film fan as such but love the old b movies and black and white sci fi films this movie will make you think you know when something is going to happen then it doesn't then it does it will keep you completely off balance i would suggest watching the movie first then the director's notes and special features it is so well written directed and filmed and i can tell you personally that it was a real joy to work with this cast and crew i sincerely hope to be part of brian and <UNK> future projects
<START> disjointed unclear bad screenplay poor photography and direction all in all very obviously an ill conceived first effort at commercial film making by the good people at <UNK> br br <UNK> pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring china cry the story of nora <UNK> to the big screen but the <UNK> code is an unfortunate <UNK> as a christian who supports <UNK> and a lot of its programming and who loved china cry i still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone they do much good with their <UNK> but this isn't an example of it don't waste your money go rent china cry instead
<START> <UNK> is a rebel and she's going to share to our wide open eyes some little sex stories between sci fi and fantasy well this surrender cinema production is not very good very bad acting horrifying music and a story line without any story and any line but the sex scenes are pretty well done lot of lesbian scenes and <UNK> <UNK> as beautiful as in the exotic house of wax offer to us a very good final and very hot strip show for <UNK> fans only
<START> this is the third parody of the scary movies and hopefully the last this time the spoof is mainly on the ring signs and 8 mile for some weird reason in my opinion this movie was very pointless and unnecessary and not even funny i laughed maybe three times and that is not enough for a comedy i really enjoyed the first two but this one was just plain dumb if your jokes consist of corpses getting beat up and people constantly throwing stuff at each other then this movie is for you in my opinion if your smart enough stay at home and save your money and please stop making these kind of movies they just keep getting worse 3 10
<START> i should <UNK> this by stating that i am a dolph lundgren fan the man turns out some of the funniest action clichés imaginable and <UNK> is probably my personal favorite spoiler even though there is no such thing as a dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a <UNK> with a sub machine gun through a high school <UNK> and the kid wins good game the oscar goes to <UNK> dolph if you're reading this thanks for the laughs old friend br br in summary terrific movie that is a guaranteed laugh i recommend <UNK> some friends over for this and forcing them to sit through it hilarious
<START> take a <UNK> of <UNK> mix it with the godfather add some roman mythology and plenty of <UNK> comedy and you have the sopranos about a mob clan operating out of northern new jersey it's almost as entertaining as pro wrestling i am not the biggest fan of this show but i do admire james <UNK> very complicated tony soprano a psychopath with an occasional <UNK> of conscience i also have come to admire <UNK> <UNK> of folks like <UNK> voiced dom <UNK> as the <UNK> but murderous uncle junior silver haired tony <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> paulie and the very beautiful edie <UNK> as the <UNK> tough as nails <UNK> soprano the violence is sudden and graphic the body count <UNK> climbs each season but it is often the small moments that matter most here watch paulie and tony's nephew christopher michael <UNK> late of law order as they get lost in the <UNK> <UNK> and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandoned <UNK> both convinced they've had it
<START> i have to confess right off that i have never been a fan of rodney <UNK> indeed from me he gets no respect i watched this only because my wife wanted to see it and found exactly what i expected a stupid story without any real humour it's full of lame crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a <UNK> <UNK> plans to build a <UNK> resort in <UNK> that just didn't capture my attention at all br br in addition to <UNK> the film starred a weak cast including the likes of andrew <UNK> clay and the totally over the hill john <UNK> i didn't even know he was still around until i saw his name in the credits for this br br this truly is a <UNK> disaster br br 2 10
<START> i just sat in the theater bored as hell i wanted to leave halfway through the movie the plot is simple 4 <UNK> guys wreck <UNK> so they have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding yawn br br the thing that <UNK> me off the most was the so called crude jokes they were highly unfunny clichéd and thrown in your face to make you get into the already dull movie the acting was below average and i felt this movie just went on and on about nothing but a bunch of unfunny jokes and a predictable plot br br all in all one of the worse movies i've seen of 2006 unfunny bad acting just ugly br br well thank god a friend <UNK> me br br avoid
<START> this movie had what sounded like a good premise 9 people facing their fears to win one million dollars unfortunately it did not turn out to be a good movie there are several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene a few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts the acting is bad but some of the lines are amusing in their awfulness what's really strange is that towards the end of the movie it turns into like a 5 minute western and at the end the twists of which their were several don't make sense with the rest of the movie it seemed as though the director just added stuff on because he thought it would look cool while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point it just didn't make a lot of sense the only creepy thing was the old people dancing down the hall but that doesn't even come close to making up for the rest of this mess
<START> i found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film i managed to stomach 45 50 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching monster house instead which by the way is great fun br br the story has massive holes in it the plot line is hugely over stated and dull the acting is awful especially from justin timberlake who should really stick to what he is good at looking <UNK> and singing like a <UNK> morgan freeman looked incredibly uncomfortable especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and timberlake meet freeman and <UNK> characters seem to be supposed to have some sort of father son relationship of sorts or something which simply isn't evident at all apart from the fact that though <UNK> character seems to have nothing but contempt for the ignorant and rather stupid character of timberlake he never the less pulls out all the stops to help him <UNK> a completely ridiculous cover up br br it would take some incredible suspension of disbelief to give any credit to the story line which is simply absurd and blown out of all <UNK> br br don't watch this film it is a pure waste of time
<START> polanski returns to the themes of <UNK> and madness which he explored to such tremendous effect in <UNK> and rosemary's baby in the tenant br br the atmosphere is trademark polanski dark brooding unnerving but there is something awkward about this movie and i am not sure whether or not it is deliberate br br <UNK> <UNK> who was responsible for some of <UNK> most beautiful films doesn't quite do himself justice here as his name was one of the things which really attracted me to this movie i was a little disappointed in how few instances of truly impressive cinematography are in the film br br the only thing that really lets the movie down is the acting polanski is certainly not a bad actor but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of <UNK> some of the supporting cast are great notably melvyn douglas as the <UNK> and shelley winters as the <UNK> but others are weak and miscast it is also hard to get past the fact that all these supposed <UNK> have american accents br br quite unexpectedly there are some fine moments of dark comedy in the film anyone who has seen the <UNK> vampire killers knows that polanski is certainly a good comedic actor however there are moments when it slips dangerously close to being a parody of itself <UNK> sudden and somewhat unexplained <UNK> is more likely to raise <UNK> than <UNK> which <UNK> from what should have been a powerful moment in his psycho dramatic journey br br all in all the tenant is an enjoyable and intriguing experience if a little too <UNK> for its own good there's a handful of exceptionally chilling moments and a consistently uncomfortable and foreboding atmosphere but this film while being very good does not quite hit the mark as successfully as it could have br br alas at the end of the day an <UNK> polanski movie is still better than most other <UNK> movies definitely worth a watch just don't expect to be blown away
<START> the notorious bettie page written by mary harron <UNK> turner directed by mary harron br br how do you define a person who has always been between two worlds one of presumed sin and one of supposed redemption especially when that person eventually <UNK> to a split personality disorder in her latter years as if to demonstrate her own point if you're director mary harron you don't shy away from showing the push pull nature of the notorious bettie page you allow the character to drift back and forth between the healing forgiveness of the power of god and the church and the seductive illusion of control and <UNK> <UNK> to page during her years as a <UNK> model by doing so audiences are offered a complex character that is <UNK> forward by a desire to leave her difficult past with a naive enjoyment in <UNK> lust for her and a struggle to <UNK> her image in the eyes of god come the right time it will no longer matter how many eyes are on her because there is only one pair that counts br br shot mostly in black and white with some unnecessary bursts of color the notorious bettie page is at times a light humorous comedy making the film an enjoyable experience and also one that <UNK> fun at how seriously people believe in the corruption of pornography but the delicate hand of the director is more <UNK> felt during <UNK> times of despair harron is a sensitive <UNK> director who does not throw <UNK> numerous and devastating blows of abuse in the face of her viewer instead she allows the surprisingly effective gretchen <UNK> who plays the title role the chance to hammer the pain of her character into the viewer with fear in her eyes <UNK> is her cries and shame on her skin whereas most directors perhaps most male directors would find it essential to show the heroine in painful positions in order to draw a link between the kinds of atrocities that were put upon her and where her life took her harron has too much compassion for her character her actress and her audience from <UNK> page learns to trust people again and as more and more <UNK> fall in love with her image the more she falls in love with their admiration and the control she has over the <UNK> by the time her poses cross over into the realm of soft core s m she has found a way to combine her need to be respected with the <UNK> she has been <UNK> to her whole life br br mary <UNK> bettie page is a woman who <UNK> for control over her life and destiny yet ultimately is always being told where to stand how to smile and what to wear when she finally realizes that none of her choices have been her own she chooses to embrace god and <UNK> his word to those who will listen the true sadness behind this most important decision is that she is still letting someone else guide her <UNK> she just has more faith that this direction will be better for her soul
<START> my girlfriend once brought around the zombie chronicles for us to watch as a joke little did we realize the joke was on her for paying <UNK> for it while watching this film i started to come up with things i would rather be doing than watching the zombie chronicles these included br br 1 drinking <UNK> 2 <UNK> sand in my eyes 3 writing a letter to brad sykes and <UNK> <UNK> 4 re <UNK> the american civil war 5 tax returns 6 <UNK> <UNK> 7 sex with an old lady br br <UNK> <UNK> aka sgt ben <UNK> wrote this the guy couldn't even dig a hole properly the best <UNK> he did was kick a door down the best part of the film this was the worst film i have ever seen and i've seen white noise the light never has a film had so many mistakes in it my girlfriend left it here so now i live with the shame of <UNK> this piece of crap br br news just in owen wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself fact br br do not watch
<START> macarthur is a great movie with a great story about a great <UNK> douglas macarthur this is of course the story of one of america's great military figures and a figure made familiar to me from the earliest moments of my memory though there is a continuity issue there may be others e g <UNK> speech portrayed in the film as his <UNK> address to the u s military academy on accepting the <UNK> award did not contain the phrase old soldiers never die they just fade away that was in his speech to <UNK> upon his <UNK> by president truman in 1951 for his alleged <UNK> these two did not see eye to eye gregory peck is im peck able as the general who <UNK> he would return to the <UNK> in world war ii the film moves quickly and easily with the general his family and his staff from the beginning of the second world war to the end of his service career this film would be of much greater significance to one familiar with both <UNK> ii and the korean war nevertheless <UNK> portrayal of this great man who fought the twin <UNK> of <UNK> and communism and who hated war as only a soldier can is a memorable one indeed in war there is no substitute for victory

<START> this was a disappointing movie considering the material army life is always good for a laugh and the stars this movie should have been a fall down <UNK> it was worth a couple of chuckles at best steve martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that dan <UNK> should stick to dramatic roles where he might follow robin <UNK> lead and someday win an oscar
<START> bsg is one of my all time favourite tv series i was lucky enough to start watching it as the series came to it's final season it was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was br br as soon as i noticed the pilot on <UNK> i knew exactly what i was in for just by the title caprica although some things don't add up when you compare both series it is still beautifully executed there were no mention about the <UNK> in battlestar galactica or the mention of virtual worlds but maybe i haven't got far enough into the series for them to explain why br br i recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe technology and alternate fantasies of our world this show is very interesting and will have you wanting to watch more
<START> follow the fleet an rko production in 1936 stars fred astaire and ginger rogers in a complex romantic comedy although fred astaire and ginger rogers have had many similar romantic movies together rko helped them to once again create a worth while storyline that <UNK> relevant situations to society at the time it was made the narrative of follow the fleet relies heavily on the use of layered story lines between the two sets of main characters to create a satisfying romantic comedy br br the general plot of the movie revolves around <UNK> baker a sailor in the u s navy played by fred astaire and <UNK> martin <UNK> former love and dance partner who is now a singer and dancer played by ginger rogers their story begins when <UNK> is on the ship and his <UNK> <UNK> smith finds a photo of the two of them together and <UNK> reveals that the last time he saw her he had asked her to marry him so <UNK> suggests that they try and meet up with her when they are on land in hopes that she might have a friend br br the next major scene begins the second plot of the movie when connie martin <UNK> sister is refused entry into paradise where her sister works unless she is <UNK> by a gentleman she turns around to find <UNK> behind her with a bag full of <UNK> so she plays it off like she was waiting on him and buys his entrance into paradise as well connie then finds <UNK> and tells her that she is depressed because she cannot have the luck <UNK> does with men so <UNK> suggests she get a <UNK> from her friends while she is performing on stage connie gets made over and enters the ballroom once again and approaches <UNK> again who is <UNK> by the sight of her this <UNK> the second romantic storyline between <UNK> and connie br br throughout the remainder of the movie the story and rising actions are <UNK> between <UNK> comedic <UNK> of the two <UNK> troubles that create several mini rising and falling actions within the overall plot <UNK> and <UNK> hit it off their first moments together as they compete in a dance competition and end up winning it reminding them of the success and pleasure the two have when they are together similarly <UNK> is able to <UNK> connie through his romantic attempts of pleasing her and they <UNK> to her house br br this series of happy events is soon followed by unsettling <UNK> that brings the rising action back down <UNK> left <UNK> the previous night to <UNK> to the ship before midnight and told her that he would come for her in the morning unfortunately the ship sets course after the <UNK> have returned <UNK> <UNK> and leaving her to think <UNK> was still being a typical sailor looking for a good time when he's on land br br the mood is again changed as another subplot is entered into the film when a party of big shots is taking a tour of the ship this alternate storyline is used to create a <UNK> between the stories of the two main relationships of the film as well as help build confidence and <UNK> of <UNK> overall good intentions the party is interrupted by the oblivious music playing coming from <UNK> and his companions when they missed the sounding to report on deck for the company the ladies are intrigued and ask to hear them play and <UNK> gladly begins to entertain them with some dancing which ultimately helps <UNK> the mood of the film as well as bring happiness to the sailors br br after returning to the <UNK> <UNK> stories <UNK> is trying to prove to <UNK> that she does not need his help with landing a job unfortunately <UNK> is unaware that she is <UNK> and goes to put in a good word for <UNK> when he <UNK> his friend at the studio talking about the remarkable lady <UNK> <UNK> takes it upon himself to help <UNK> out by <UNK> with her water making her unable to sing correctly and destroying her audition in addition to <UNK> mistake connie spent all of her money to <UNK> a ship that she was hoping <UNK> would take over as captain she had also planned a remarkable dinner date for him when he was supposed to come over but <UNK> was aware of her intentions and hopes of soon marrying and was no longer interested so he stood her up br br the remainder of the movie continues in the same format of mini rising and falling actions until the climactic point is reached between the two couples ending the movie with the happiness of both couples the use of the <UNK> stories helps to build interest and emotion within each couple as they deal with both happiness and pain through each of their struggles the <UNK> stories are also able to relate with one another as well as <UNK> other unrelated subplots to help carry the narrative through to the <UNK> scenes br br although fred astaire and ginger rogers have countless films together that <UNK> romance comedy song and dance follow the fleet is a unique film for the two actors that successfully use the technique of subplots to aid the narrative between the two main characters
<START> <UNK> is a film about a club with that very title in the setting of the 70s era it features the classic good looking bartender the sexy females the high powered owner the <UNK> when all <UNK> together chaos ensues and the bartender played by <UNK> seems to be at the <UNK> of it all br br i'm going to be as blunt and honest as possible whilst avoiding any outright unfair or untrue comments like it's an <UNK> film i really do find it a completely dire film <UNK> by it's dire cast every time i sit down to watch a film casting <UNK> <UNK> i am always awaiting to see her beauty <UNK> expressed simultaneously with a great performance but reality <UNK> reminds me quite abruptly how utterly talentless she is i mean really what has she ever <UNK> the masses with other than her immense table dance in <UNK> <UNK> till <UNK> the same goes for ryan <UNK> another poor actor who gives nothing to the screen but his good looks and insanely dull <UNK> otherwise known as <UNK> mike myers isn't quite as bad as these 2 he does at least give the film something worthy playing the seedy <UNK> co <UNK> of the <UNK> club the type that the majority watching would hate i e job well done he puts in a somewhat convincing performance that gave me rare enjoyment from the flick but alas it is not enough to rescue the film from it's <UNK> and flat <UNK> most <UNK> bad films i find something to take from the film but this has nothing to it really <UNK> campbell isn't too bad but she is just <UNK> the storyline is dull it appears the writer was more bent on making a film of this style and <UNK> and forgot to add anything else any meaning any class anything at all because like most <UNK> they are just hollow pointless objects that are merely pretty to look at much akin to the basis of this disastrous film br br genuinely an hour and a half of time i could have spent better doing something much more exciting like talking to 90 year old relatives on the phone about the weather
<START> i saw this film at the toronto international film festival filmed during an actual <UNK> match for the 2006 world cup <UNK> works brilliantly as both a comedy and a tragedy the film follows the <UNK> of a group of young women who are caught trying to sneak into a football match at <UNK> <UNK> stadium the country's <UNK> religious leaders have <UNK> that women may not sit with men at sporting events <UNK> they be exposed to <UNK> and other morally questionable behaviour this hasn't stopped the country's young female fans who continue to sneak in using various tricks but <UNK> focuses on a small group who have been caught and are being <UNK> <UNK> close to the action they beg the bored soldiers <UNK> them to let them go or at least to let them watch the match the soldiers tell them they shouldn't have tried to get in that they could have watched the game at home on tv they banter back and forth in almost real time as the game continues just off camera br br there is one very funny sequence where a young soldier <UNK> one of the girls to the <UNK> since there are no female <UNK> at <UNK> he has to clear the room of any men before he can allow her to go in plus he makes her cover her face so no one can see she's a woman this is accomplished using a poster of iranian soccer star ali <UNK> as a mask with eye holes <UNK> out br br you get a real sense that even the soldiers are <UNK> by the <UNK> and are only carrying out their orders so as to <UNK> the end of their <UNK> military service one soldier complains that he was supposed to be on leave so he could take care of his family's cattle in the countryside little by little the girls and the soldiers talk to each other and there are numerous small acts of kindness on both sides to show that these are basically good people living in terrible circumstances however the <UNK> constant reminder that the chief is on his way lends a sense of menace since we don't know what sort of punishment the women will face br br unlike most iranian films which are known for their strong visuals <UNK> is filmed in a <UNK> style with no <UNK> in fact the film was made during the actual <UNK> match against <UNK> that took place on june 5 2005 the plot in many ways was determined by the result on the pitch if iran won the match they would qualify if they lost they would not since the world cup has come and gone i don't think it is a spoiler to say that iran won the match the scenes of celebration at the end of the film were real and spontaneous which gave the film a real authenticity seeing how much this meant to the people of iran was deeply touching br br as well one of the young women makes reference at the end of the film to seven fans who died during the iran japan match on march 25 just a few weeks before they were <UNK> to death after police began to <UNK> the crowd with water to move them in a certain direction knowing that this was a real life tragedy added another level of <UNK> to the <UNK> br br i don't want to go off on a long political <UNK> but this film gave me real hope that there are those in iran who are hoping for change and working at it iran is a nation of young people and it is only a matter of time before they take the place of their <UNK> in the political <UNK> films like this one show the proud spirit of the iranian people in spite of their present difficulties and it's my sincere hope that there is a <UNK> future for them
<START> as soon as i heard about this film i knew i had to check it out well i heard about it then i found the trailer after that that's when i knew i had to see it and i am so glad i did you want to see classic television mixed with zombies no then get lost br br fido is a movie unlike anything i've ever seen well actually it kind of is it's kind of like a <UNK> episode and a zombie film though when combined it feels completely new and original fido is about a little boy named timmy and his new pet fido well this new pet ain't no <UNK> <UNK> or some <UNK> trained puppy it's a re animated dead guy a zombie a large radiation cloud <UNK> earth which led to all of the dead rising which <UNK> the zombie wars though through the genius of <UNK> <UNK> lead scientist of <UNK> he discovered that if you destroy the brain the zombie will <UNK> thus giving us the edge and the win in the zombie war though due to lingering radiation whoever dies becomes a zombie which can be a problem especially with the elderly though <UNK> steps up again with more <UNK> especially with the <UNK> collar the collar stops the <UNK> need for human flesh and thus making it harmless as a household pet but not all is perfect in this zombie <UNK> <UNK> break old people die and well i'll just let you watch this incredibly unique flick br br fido is a fantastic idea brought to <UNK> with an all star cast and great writing fido rises above most in the comedy horror genre there are plenty of funny and original situations that really had me entertained though after seeing the film i personally think the movie would have been better in black and white at less than 90 minutes the movie doesn't go on for too long and moves from scene to scene at a good rate it'll probably end up being a cult classic of sorts since it's not really a laugh out loud comedy or even a horror movie it's a comedy family zombie film immersed in the 1950 vibe if you thought anything i said here was interesting by all means check this film out but if you're still on the fence swing your leg back over and stay there 8 5 outta 10
<START> honestly this is easily in the top 5 of the worst movies i have ever seen partly because it takes itself so seriously as opposed to regular light hearted trash this movies wants you to be emotionally involved to feel for the characters and to care about the alleged conspiracy none of this ever even comes close to happening br br mild spoilers br br there are 3 main reasons why this movie is so terrible 1 incoherent and totally non <UNK> plot 2 annoying style over substance mtv <UNK> 3 moronic characters and plot holes br br allow me to elaborate br br 1 apparently when this movies was being made they couldn't decide whether to make a movie about church <UNK> the <UNK> or possession so guess what they combined them an <UNK> gets possessed by a dead person who then makes her exhibit the <UNK> so as to expose a church conspiracy how a regular person is able to <UNK> death and possess another human being through his <UNK> is never explained nor even talked about now instead of just saying what he wants to say he gives her the <UNK> why why not just spit it out instead we get treated to scenes of screaming things in harsh voices <UNK> <UNK> messages on cars and writing messages on walls apparently this priest was also a violent guy because the possessed young lady also <UNK> out on one o f the characters while talking in that cliched harsh possessed voice that we all have heard countless times this also starts to tie into my second complaint because whenever the young lady gets the <UNK> she also defies the laws of gravity by floating into the air and <UNK> everything and everybody around her as if they were in an <UNK> why does this happen who knows my guess is that the director thought it looked cool br br 2 this movies contains dozens of shots in slow motion of course of birds showing up out of nowhere and flying off and most annoyingly of water dripping this woman's apartment is constantly dripping water constantly <UNK> the place would probably fall apart with this many holes to sum up this complaint towards the end and for absolutely no reason the camera cuts to shots of water dripping in slow motion in reverse why i have no idea it has no relevance to anything and once again i'm <UNK> it's because the director thought it looked cool br br 3 one of the main characters says he became a priest to explain away holes in science this doesn't make sense to me i would think that going to church would be enough but no he has to go through the entire <UNK> of becoming a priest i just don't buy it secondly there are lots of plot holes a few of which i will elaborate on below for starters when she first gets the <UNK> the scene ends with her laying unconscious bleeding next she's in the hospital who called the <UNK> another one is towards the end when the previously mentioned scientific priest character is talking to the spirit who is <UNK> the girl he says take me as your <UNK> not a word for word quote but you get the idea his response you have no faith only doubt so because of this he possesses an <UNK> an <UNK> has no faith far less then any scientific priest and then there's the fact that the object of this movie's conspiracy this lost <UNK> of st thomas i believe is available at local <UNK> the characters are willing to kill to <UNK> this document but you could walk down to a <UNK> and buy it maybe this is supposed to take place in an alternate history where it isn't wide known but the movie never tries to tell us this or to even hint that this is an alternate happening of that <UNK> <UNK> br br in closing this movie is terrible to a spectacular degree it is my arch nemesis which i feel the need to insult every chance i get i <UNK> it final grade f
<START> a must see i saw whipped at a press screening and it was hilarious we're talking <UNK> laughs it makes something about mary seem like a meandering drama amanda <UNK> screams star quality with her winning combination of beauty brains and serious acting ability peter cohen the director has made a cutting edge film that shows the raw inside of men's <UNK> in the urban dating world for all of it's comedy whipped succeeds with it's intelligence which is so rare for a first time director especially with a romantic comedy he is a major talent <UNK> <UNK> brian van holt jonathan <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> round out the cast with depth and very strong performances as the would be slick <UNK> men you've got to see these guys go to work and get caught in <UNK> web check out the trailer on whipped com it's worth the 3 minute <UNK>
<START> best of the best 4 is better than 3 but just barely basically i say this because part 4 doesn't <UNK> parts 1 2 like 3 does ie their is no reference to tommy lee having siblings br br anyway i liked the russian plot line of the story and especially <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bit part as boris aside from that though and a few fighting scenes the movie is nothing special the limited budget is also very noticeable especially in the airplane blow up scene br br also part 4 does not really have a moral or say anything like part 3 did there are a couple of more better known actors hudson <UNK> in part 4 but alas nothing like the beginning of the series and even these characters have very small roles br br alas it seems best of the best is the <UNK> show and to be truthful he cannot carry a movie br br saw on tape rating 4
<START> honestly who in god's name gave this movie an 8 1 rating i guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted otherwise this movie sucks this movie is nothing more than an amateur or possibly student film i'm a movie fanatic and have seen terrible movies but there was literally nothing redeeming here the story and acting was the worst i've ever seen the props including the use of toy <UNK> guns with terrible special effects where just as bad as everything else i'm all for bad language in movies but the f bomb was dropped about every third word and i think we might have a winner for the most use of the f bomb in any movie ever the movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film i'd expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country but it doesn't belong on a dvd br br do not buy this movie do not rent this movie all i can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental <UNK> this is valuable time that you will never get back unfortunately for me that time is lost but it's not too late for you if you decide to rent this movie consider this my warning
<START> nice pleasant and funny but not earth shattering it does a good job of showing the behind the scenes world of theater groups and the lives of the actors the three witches are great both on and off stage i would assume the movie works wonderfully lots of apparent inside jokes if one was involved in theater which i'm not
<START> this is a sad film made for sad people i was sitting in theaters <UNK> my hair apart wanting to break the <UNK> in front of me as the movie <UNK> out one cringe inducing scenes after another and there were people roaring with laughter behind me which made me wonder what kind of films these people must be watching to actually enjoy this horse s t br br <UNK> <UNK> has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters the screenplay is dull probably he was drunk when he was writing this film there is no strong hold on any of these stories nothing new nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before one of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it i mean seriously is this story really required its not funny not creative but only proves that <UNK> has no sense of comedy another of the stories which was probably the only story i was interested in is based on a man's infidelity and that too ends in a lame age old <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> crap i have no idea what the <UNK> <UNK> plot was all about there was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot she can't take <UNK> <UNK> film because she has to marry <UNK> why can't she marry him and still take the film or does <UNK> and <UNK> just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married with six actors in the film obviously <UNK> cant produce the film all by himself so he makes full use of <UNK> like the times group shamelessly promoting their <UNK> magazines and also some <UNK> brand which the women in the film absolutely seem to adore i come to imdb to give it the worst rating and i am shocked to see <UNK> <UNK> the film it just goes to show the sad state of bollywood and how star struck the fans are with fans like these movies like <UNK> e <UNK> will be continue to be made and worse probably be a hit
<START> another comment about this film made it sound lousy given talking pictures were so new i think the script and acting were good davis was so young and fresh she had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect yet it is great to see her this way still learning the craft br br so many clichés came from this film and it seems this film <UNK> some <UNK> for the next 70 years my vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight i love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments
<START> this movie is a great example of how even some very funny jokes can go terribly wrong i really expected at least something from this movie after seeing the add which was funny as hell but the movie wasn't half as good br br the weird part is that the jokes are actually funny the spoofs of the smoking <UNK> jo <UNK> etc are genuinely good jokes but i don't know whom to blame this movie flop on br br the prime candidates may be 1 the <UNK> actors and <UNK> actresses and not even the funny kind 2 the director 3 the guy who cast the actors and or the director anyway if you are really really bored and i mean really see this movie or else get a copy of each and every ad or <UNK> of this movie and laugh your butt of because those will be far funnier than the film br br p s the only saving grace of this film is <UNK> <UNK> and the funny <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this is the second <UNK> fox film i have seen the fantastic actor <UNK> <UNK> who starred in walk on water has a minor role in this film also br br but the real stars are the young <UNK> who live together in a tiny apartment noam <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the palestinian that joins them off and on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there is sort of a friends sex in the city thing going on mostly gay and they all just want the war to end so they can go on with their lives in peace br br but that's the rub no matter how many posters you put up or how many <UNK> for peace you have the war is not going to end many have tried over the years to bring the two sides to the table but they just want to keep it going for whatever reason there are many on the israeli side both there and here in the us who just want it all and will not consider peace there are many on the palestinian side who apparently would be out of a job should peace ever come it is in no one's interest to end this war and the children suffer br br this is always on your mind as you watch this funny and engaging film it won't go away you know something tragic is going to happen and of course it does with the feelings on both sides running strong and revenge as the <UNK> tragedy always happens and that is what makes this an adult version of friends sex in the city there is no <UNK> it is real life and it was a beautiful thing to see
<START> how do you spell washed up fat italian who can barely pull off a martial arts move without needing some heart <UNK> in this movie we see steven seagal at his lowest level of accomplishment since his career started it has been a steady decline into pathetic over indulgent behavior that has <UNK> his career in this movie it looks like most of his training consisted of <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> at his restaurant every day br br he is fat slow and very old looking in this movie hardly a martial arts action hero more like a laughing stock clown br br it's time for steven seagal to <UNK> this movie is about 2 hours of reasons why br br plot fat italian guy with a big reputation on the force gets wind that a crime group may be playing around with a drug designed by the military to create the ultimate warrior response this <UNK> although pathetic and laughable gives opportunity for some over the top fight scenes that include <UNK> through walls like a comic book br br did i mention this movie totally sucks and steven seagal is a complete joke yeah i did
<START> former private eye turned security guard <UNK> his latest <UNK> job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession his assignment to tail a mysterious french woman newly arrived in california and apparently wanted by suit and tie <UNK> <UNK> attempt to update the film noir genre without enough <UNK> or wit or involving plot dynamics in the screenplay director and co <UNK> paul <UNK> who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement doesn't give off the impression of having high regard for the <UNK> films his chandler was <UNK> from his nostalgia is appropriately <UNK> but also bitter <UNK> and somewhat indifferent the handling is curiously <UNK> low <UNK> and warren <UNK> is well cast as this '70s <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but the movie doesn't have any snap nice to see leslie caron and gloria <UNK> in the cast though neither has much to do and <UNK> hot and cold running character is <UNK> throughout vivid cinematography by alan <UNK> nice location shooting but it fails to come to any kind of a <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> i just bought the dvd and i must say after seeing brazil and fear an loathing in las vegas terry does it again as well of being a fan of the monty python movies terry <UNK> genius follows through in this sci fi thriller whom bruce willis plays a wonderful role as james cole and as well perhaps my favorite character brad pitt who played the insanity of <UNK> <UNK> a must have for sci fi fans or movie fan of any type really because it includes suspense drama action etc br br any way the plot in the future 1 of the world's population survives a disease intended to wipe out the human race which is unleashed in the past by the army of twelve monkeys james cole bruce willis is sent back to 1996 which is when the virus was unleashed to find out about the disease so scientists in his time can find a cure before i go further james cole lives in an underground society and the animals rule the world on the surface due to the disease that will kill the humans anyway when he is sent back in time he is actually sent back to 1990 where he is sent to a mental institution because of his <UNK> to people of the virus during his stay he meets <UNK> <UNK> brad pitt who is later mostly responsible for <UNK> out the human race he also meets his psychiatrist <UNK> <UNK> who eventually teams up with bruce to save the world as she sees that he is correct in his <UNK> he is sent back and forth from his time to the past and eventually sent to 1996 where he then questions his own sanity but later pulls through to reveal a suspenseful end quarter of the movie and later builds up to the somewhat shocking climax where he tries to stop the man carrying the virus not actually brad pitt and is instead shot by the police as the killer gets away
<START> well what i can say about this movie is that it's great to see so many asian faces what i didn't like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role the asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead the white guy <UNK> with asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the keeping it real black cab driver plus all the coke shanghai <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> product placement was a bit too obvious the story plot itself was fun but pretty much how i thought the story would unravel then again when watching romantic comedies you can't expect much but then again i would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once the parents are the best part of the flick
<START> i cant help it but i seem to like films that are meant to be scary and are just plain bad i have personally listed it in my own top 10 worst movies right under creatures of the <UNK> watch this film and have a laugh just don't expect to see any academy awards for acting more chance of understanding the film its self in all honesty though i have seen much worse than this plus some maniac <UNK> round the desert <UNK> the same people out that just died is that unbelievable that its got to be original i think its one of those love or hate movies you can make up your own mind yes its awful but it pulls it off somehow thats why i love it
<START> zombi 3 has an interesting history in it's making firstly it is a sequel to <UNK> hit zombi 2 with zombi 2 itself being of course a marketing <UNK> to trick people into thinking it was a sequel to george a romero's dawn of the dead aka zombi confusing enough basically none of the films have anything to do with one another but who cares when they make money i guess fulci himself starting to not care about the production about half way through zombi 3 when he decided to walk out bruno mattei was brought on board to help pad the film with additional scenes to <UNK> the running time br br zombi <UNK> plot is your typical zombie fare scientists develop a serum on an island in the <UNK> terrorists steal it <UNK> a plague and zombie run amok the scientists want to create an <UNK> while the military is set on <UNK> down everyone without prejudice there are also brief <UNK> of a radio dj preaching about how we treat the planet br br overall i actually liked this film i heard horrible things but i find the goofy dialogue quite enjoyable the film seems to be an attempt at raising awareness about <UNK> <UNK> military man playing god etc i get the feeling this was at one point a serious film but it <UNK> off in a weird direction presumably when mattei came on board br br besides ripping off other zombie flicks this was very reminiscent of romero's the <UNK> you hear the radio dj breaking the good news with when you see the men in white suits gas masks run to them for help this is of course played to the images of the men in white <UNK> down zombies later they straight up steal a scene from <UNK> in which one of the regular <UNK> people is killed by mistake br br the gore factor is pretty good in this one with zombie <UNK> around every corner how is it cool let me count the <UNK> zombie birth 2 flying zombie head 3 zombie birds 4 zombie with no legs swimming in a pool my favorite zombie was the <UNK> wielding maniac at the gas station he was bad ass and nearly <UNK> down the entire building trying to kill a girl br br favorite quote  when a sergeant insists on <UNK> a zombie the scientists asks don't you think that once the ash is in the air it will fall to the ground and <UNK> everything to which the <UNK> <UNK> replies now you're talking science fiction he also continues to mention the science fiction told by the scientists even at the end when everyone dies br br extras gallery trailers and interviews most notably the one with mattei where he insists he directed 40 of the scenes yet cannot recall which ones or any other significant details br br bottom line a must see for zombie and fulci fans br br rating 7 10 br br molly <UNK> www <UNK> com <UNK> com <UNK>
<START> this movie sucked they took something from my childhood and raped it in an <UNK> this movie was so bad i wanted to go home and hold my dukes dvds and cry in a corner the cast was terrible it wasn't the dukes it was <UNK> and jackass driving a car when was boss <UNK> evil when was <UNK> a tough guy they never were boss <UNK> was greedy and <UNK> was an idiot when did jesse smoke pot he never did now don't get me wrong i'm very liberal and there's nothing wrong with a little chiba but it had no place in this movie the only thing good about this movie was the trailers before the movie and the end credits it was a waste of money time and air avoid at all costs
<START> as with most <UNK> russell movies this one is very entertaining it's fun all the way through it's definitely one of the last of this genre of film just good wholesome entertainment give it a try i don't think you will be disappointed
<START> this is one of my favorite family movies loved it when i was little and it still holds up with me now that i'm older i still laugh at all the same old jokes and might even shed a tear a times i never have much cared for animals talking or at least un animated ones but this one i'll stand up for it's a pretty old movie but it will always hold a place in my heart br br there aren't any other live animal movies that i can think of at the moment that i even could compare with let alone like as much as this one i might be giving too much praise to this movie but i don't think show i really holds that great message that home is where the heart is or at least that's the message i gained from it definitely recommended for a good old family movie night
<START> i don't have much to add to my summary this film ranks right up the there with top gun as one of the funniest films ever made while not trying to be i for one don't think it should be taken seriously when watched as it is very enjoyable br br i don't think it brings christopher <UNK> reputation down either as his reputation was on the <UNK> back then anyway it took pulp fiction to wake him from the <UNK> he had been in as for michael <UNK> he has been in some of the great funny while not trying to be serious films total recall top gun what i think is amazing is the budget this movie had the scenes and actors and explosions etc are quite amazing so obviously someone liked it quite a lot and was willing to risk a lot of money whoever he or she was i like them because i love this film br br if anyone reads this looking for information on <UNK> and i seriously doubt <UNK> be too many just know that it is a hilarious movie and should be viewed with a smile on your face
<START> it was a bit bizarre and evil and i enjoyed it a lot the characters in the show were great as well and <UNK> one another well i was sorry to see it cut off i would have loved to see where it could have went you found yourself <UNK> toward lucas buck the sheriff who had more secrets than anyone lucas was frightening and <UNK> and i would have liked to have seen more of him and how his character became i will however buy the show just to enjoy it was great to something different on tv and <UNK> <UNK> who was <UNK> cousin she was a big mystery as to where and what she meant to lucas its a shame it isn't around still or was never finished i would have loved to see what would have happened
<START> i watched this film in youth group where my otherwise <UNK> youth leader and his wife <UNK> over it then some adult couple at a church related christmas party <UNK> themselves into giving a copy of this movie to every single family in <UNK> and now my household is stuck with the film though it thankfully still remains in its <UNK> i cried bitter tears over these sad events and here's why first off this film has good intentions especially if you're a christian like me this movie is trying to show that you should put your faith in god and that it'll make your life better not so bad right eh it turns out a be a problem a big one this movie was made by a church so of course every single issue has to be dealt with as <UNK> for christians as possible it is all black and white no gray areas god's grace and will in this movie is a predictable thing and it comes instantly to all those who do his <UNK> br br this is not the god i know this is not the christian life i am familiar with the god i believe in is a powerful and <UNK> god but he is not one that <UNK> my every wish i follow him as best i can though the going is often hard yet the football team in this movie finds their <UNK> and self control a lot easier than anyone should ever find it i cannot relate to cardboard <UNK> who flip from bad side to good side in the course of a few structured movie scenes and when i do follow his <UNK> as laid out in the bible i certainly don't find myself <UNK> in <UNK> as these characters do the largest of my immediate <UNK> is knowing that i have done the right thing everything else comes with long messy <UNK> work br br but take the example this movie sets grant taylor <UNK> the football team at <UNK> christian school which has had 6 losing seasons in a row he may lose his job over it and he and his wife are low on money as it is they want a baby but the doctor tells him he is <UNK> oh and his car doesn't work and the boys on his football team are <UNK> to their parents whiny after their million <UNK> and bad at kicking field goals this is sure one <UNK> community here br br but wait grant taylor decides he's going to trust in god for everything and he passes on his faith to his team so far so good not for long as they begin to <UNK> <UNK> literally pour in on them suddenly the students stop <UNK> their parents the school has a big revival the team starts winning every game they even win the grand championship against the hardest team in the league coach <UNK> job is <UNK> the school gets him a shiny new truck as a present which by the way is the epitome of shallow fair weather <UNK> he gets a raise his wife get this even gets pregnant from his <UNK> <UNK> and that skinny kid manages to kick his first darn field goal right when it really matters <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> praise the lord <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> just <UNK> nobody in my church has ever experienced christ in a such a cut and dry manner yes there have been <UNK> <UNK> in my family as well as gifts and creature <UNK> and i <UNK> them to god's grace and <UNK> but god isn't some <UNK> tap that you turn on and off by being good or bad he is by and large a mystery his gifts come unexpectedly often when you think you don't need them but you really do it's a long hard <UNK> to the road of <UNK> and things never turn out the way you thought they would br br this movie has good intentions but because of its supreme <UNK> and total <UNK> it tanks tremendously to a 1 10 the bad acting and sports movie clichés seem to be mere <UNK> next to the <UNK> <UNK> that this movie inadvertently pushes br br to all you future <UNK> planning to make a movie don't be afraid to show real life even you have to add some <UNK> truths into the mix however much the <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> by this <UNK> candy treat nobody has learned anything substantial from it give us the meat the bones the real stuff true life applies to everyone not just christians and that's one aspect facing the giants didn't manage to grasp
<START> all the kids aged from 14 16 want to see this movie although you are only allowed at 18 they have heard it is a very scary movie and they feel so cool when they watched it i feel very sad kids can't see what a good movie is and what a bad movie is this was one of the worst movies i saw in months every scene you see in this movie is a copy from another movie and the end it's an open ending why because it is impossible to come up with a decent en for such a stupid story this movie is just made to make you scared and if you are a bit smart and know some about music you exactly know when you'll be scared br br when the movie was finished and i turned to my friend and told a bit to loud him that this was a total waste of money some stupid kid looked strange at me these day i could make an oscar with a home video of my <UNK> if only i use the right marketing
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have seen recently when a man says that he wishes he had a super power of being able to <UNK> pleasure himself i pretty much consider the movie to be in the realm of childish 14 year old male fantasies the bed room scene was over the top and reduced an intimate moment into a farce of <UNK> functions akin to passing gas in public from the first every other scene was a discussion about how little sex they where getting how long its been since they got some when their next sexual <UNK> will be and with whom it should be with on top of that the dialogue and acting was very poor and very forced not felt and they filled their lack of content with sleazy sex scenes this could have been really funny because the concept is actually interesting but it is poorly executed here please do not even think about taking anyone under 16 if you have to go and see it
<START> i'm sorry i had high hopes for this movie unfortunately it was too long too thin and too weak to hold my attention when i realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy <UNK> his dream i felt cheated surely it could have been a device to bring us into something deeper something more meaningful br br so don't buy a large drink or you'll be running to the rest room my kids didn't enjoy it either ah well
<START> this movie struck home for me being <UNK> i remember the <UNK> and my father working in a factory i figured if i worked hard too if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream the house a few kids a car all to call my own i've noted however without a degree in something unlike my father that quit at <UNK> grade and a keen sense of greed and <UNK> you can't get anywhere br br i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs it's made for tv and i just saw it an hour ago <UNK> <UNK> find it anywhere i'd love to show this to my friends my pseudo friends family and other relatives see what they think and remind them that once upon a time americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished i think the feeling is still there but in a heavy <UNK> spiral with so many things being made overseas
<START> walter <UNK> is <UNK> mason a civil attorney who takes on a criminal case in the unknown man a 1951 film also starring ann <UNK> barry sullivan <UNK> <UNK> and richard anderson a great believer in justice <UNK> accepts a pro <UNK> case defending a young man <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> accused of murder and gets him <UNK> shortly afterward he realizes that the man is guilty and was <UNK> protection money from his victim as well as other <UNK> in the neighborhood he is advised by the da sullivan that <UNK> is small change that to wipe out the organized crime one has to find the top man mason finds the top man and is faced with a dilemma br br the unknown man is a small black and white film that manages to hold the viewer's interest with its various plot twists though the plot is somewhat contrived it's really the story of a good man seeking his god justice and what he is willing to do in order to <UNK> it and that's the most contrived part of all i suppose there was a time before o j the <UNK> brothers etc etc when people believed in justice and the integrity of <UNK> for this viewer anyway those days are long over br br walter <UNK> does an excellent job his handsome elegant demeanor and <UNK> voice show us a successful confident man but also a deeply caring one <UNK> had a magnificent career <UNK> 60 years but never really rose to <UNK> he was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did it may be because by the time he was getting leads he was well into his thirties and missed being a <UNK> idol or it could be he lacked that certain something or that he was <UNK> early on as second lead to a big female star like <UNK> <UNK> hard to say he gives an honest and touching performance here br br very good movie with good performances
<START> alex d <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> culkin as the central figure in the third movie in the home alone empire four industrial spies <UNK> a missile <UNK> system computer chip and <UNK> it through an airport inside a remote controlled toy car because of <UNK> confusion <UNK> mrs <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gets the car she gives it to her neighbor alex <UNK> just before the spies turn up the spies rent a house in order to <UNK> each house in the neighborhood until they locate the car home alone with the chicken <UNK> alex calls <UNK> each time he spots a <UNK> in progress but the spies always manage to <UNK> the police while alex is accused of making prank calls the spies finally turn their <UNK> toward alex unaware that he has <UNK> devices to cleverly <UNK> trap his entire house home alone 3 wasn't horrible but probably shouldn't have been made you can't just replace <UNK> culkin joe <UNK> or daniel stern home alone 3 had some funny parts but i don't like when characters are changed in a movie series view at own risk
<START> now i'm one to watch movies that got poor reviews and say hmm this isn't so bad i loved the cable guy and thought that my big fat independent movie was great keep in mind i really didn't start watching this with high hopes but i figured that maybe just maybe it would be bad in a kind of way i could laugh at it i was wrong at no point at all during my suffering through this film and i use that term <UNK> was i even close to being mildly entertained to start <UNK> makes quentin tarantino look like marlon brando when it comes to acting i hate rap music but as far as i could tell an <UNK> priest would probably make a better <UNK> than him the main character is simply annoying and not a character that it's easy to like quite frankly i would rather eat a <UNK> turd out of a <UNK> <UNK> bloody <UNK> than watch this again
<START> mind my friends and i saw the movie based off it's title alone it's cute though obvious in it's plot and direction you know where the movie is going within the first five minutes my main <UNK> with the plot is that while it remains <UNK> consistent they never explain a lot of the things behind the characters an alcoholic father <UNK> mother <UNK> out sister that's a bad family but aside from the occasional mention from the sister there's not any resolution i was also confused as to the scene with the <UNK> it seemed pretty random br br the writing is a secondary concern the kids weren't bad actors but their script left a lot to be desired unfortunately what could have been a cute <UNK> movie was pushed aside for a single blah special effect lame scripting and a <UNK> obvious plot
<START> the actors did a really good job playing their roles particularly the mom however as the movie progressed i found i was watching it more for their acting and not because i cared in the least for the people and at times i felt irritated by the irresponsible and hands off approach to <UNK> displayed again and again the daughter is a 17 year old shallow <UNK> whose main ambition in life is <UNK> famous men and becoming a dancing <UNK> complete with lots of <UNK> shaking the son is a guy with low self <UNK> that seems very desperate for a relationship and friends so much that he throws a drug party late in the film the husband and wife are both bored but rather than put energy into their stale relationship would rather seek out new partners though the wife picks poorly as the man she throws herself at happens to be gay <UNK> i just felt that all the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time caring for such shallow <UNK> i think the author's attempt was to demonstrate the utter <UNK> and <UNK> of the <UNK> system however given that these characters are not typical of the average western family it seems <UNK>
<START> absence of a good plot absence of decent acting absence of good cinematography absence of decent looking special effects need i go on review may contain spoilers the actors appear to be reading their lines and not very well at that most of the actors were acting like they were in a second grade play the story appeared to have been written by one of the aforementioned second <UNK> it's not really all that convoluted it's just so simple and dumb that a person thinks they must be missing something so they think it is convoluted nope it's not it's exactly as simple as you think it is i understood the film that's how i know that it <UNK> most of the film just had people sitting around talking reading their lines trying to look sinister the narrator was annoying the special effects were laughable i love low budget movies i also like <UNK> <UNK> tom <UNK> jack <UNK> and michael <UNK> just not in this movie you can tell they weren't getting paid or weren't getting paid much because neither their hearts nor their talents were in it i love tony todd however he was only adequate in this movie in fact tony <UNK> performance is the only reason i gave it 3 stars instead of 1 and tony was only in it for a whole two minutes seriously i would suggest to fast forward the dvd to the two minute tony todd segment if i had gone to the theater and paid more than a dollar to see this film i would have been p o <UNK> and <UNK> my money back hopefully the people who made this will do better next time
<START> i confess emma in my opinion is the single greatest novel ever written it is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be jane austen reaches the <UNK> of her art here br br unfortunately this is at best a <UNK> br br comparison to the gwyneth paltrow version is inevitable that version is far more faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far more enjoyable to watch br br there are some good elements here kate <UNK> having previously played <UNK> <UNK> in cold comfort farm clearly <UNK> smarter spiritual twin is a wonderful emma raymond <UNK> makes an appropriately <UNK> frank <UNK> the production is handsome but the interiors are far too dark br br however there are several major problems the first is mark strong first of all he doesn't look right for mr knightley this is perhaps because he plays the role like a <UNK> victorian <UNK> it's badly out of tune br br the second problem is one of length simply put the film is much too short to get the right kind of feel it would need to be twice as long br br finally and most significantly there is the quality of the adaptation austen is an <UNK> dream all the dialogue is there already it only needs to be <UNK> down and arranged properly andrew davies seems to think otherwise first this is a rather gloomy film and the last thing emma should be is gloomy more significantly davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of <UNK> feast what planet or minor work of thomas hardy is this come from it is utterly out of the style and spirit of the novel and i believe that it is hugely <UNK> to try to make <UNK> upon perfection br br watch the paltrow version or watch kate in cold comfort farm

<START> horrible acting bad story line cheesy makeup and this is just the tip of the iceberg i have never seen a worse movie in my life 5 minutes in i decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen it didn't aside from a nice breast shot the movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse and the same warehouse was used for at least 90 of the sets you even see this same red chair in several different locations if you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment not some warehouse which will echo all your actor's dialog note to producers renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable if you spend your money to rent this people i hope you got it with a return guarantee you will be demanding your money back i only spent 2 99 to rent this tonight and i feel ripped off
<START> this is one of the best comedy ever the writing of this parody of soap is brilliant and the cast well just look at the names of the cast and you'll understand why it is so great if you're a kevin kline fan he does as always an fantastic performance and robert downey jr is perfect if you don't laugh while seen this movie you don't have any sense of humor

<START> i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b rated movie i came out surprised and very amused eva was good but lake bell stole the show she had amazing comedic timing the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between the plot was enough to tie it all together a woman eva dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was to be husband its sounds far fetched but it actually works quite well br br 7 10 overall its a worthwhile cinema watch if not get it on dvd when it comes out
<START> simple minded but good natured drive in movie about a simple minded but good natured high school graduate who has dreams of <UNK> the coolest <UNK> van in the world to use as his ballroom br br bobby our hero spends his entire <UNK> to <UNK> the vehicle of his dreams joint sharing and love making quickly <UNK> with girls bobby has picked up at the local pizza <UNK> but he finds out much responsibility danger and <UNK> come with being the owner of such a mechanical marvel br br the van is a guilty pleasure of mine it captures the laid back mid 70's mood and has enough unintentional humor to put it into the so bad it's good category
<START> and in no way as clean logical and understandable as in <UNK> in that pathetic sum of tired hollywood cliches br br i'm 27 and i've spent 16 years of my life struggling through <UNK> <UNK> and paranoid hallucinations like the main character in the film i was successful mainly because of logic because i kept thinking over and over to keep <UNK> away from reality and to know what was really going on and what wasn't in the end i was really successful because of <UNK> by the way but i certainly escaped madness because i knew before i took <UNK> the difference between what was real and what wasn't br br so i feel entitled to tell you that this movie is a total fraud not only does it cheat with the main character's story who wasn't faithful to his wife who was <UNK> something really important here but mostly it shows a <UNK> <UNK> view of <UNK> which is entirely missing the point br br <UNK> is a mind structure not a disease a <UNK> isn't a normal man with a disease it's someone who from early on views and feels things differently from most people for him things like time space and people's personalities aren't solid things he feels it can be bent it can change it can <UNK> and maybe even disappear to cope with this a <UNK> has a rich very imaginative inner world which normal people don't expect but he's trapped in it because he can't relate with most people and his world gets <UNK> and <UNK> until he finishes in a blank <UNK> dead end br br this is very different to what's depicted in this ridiculous cure tear <UNK> movie it should be violently frightening people other than the main character should appear strange weird and absurd like in lynch's <UNK> for example there should be really impressive weird gross hallucinations because that's what <UNK> is all about it's not about details br br i mean watch naked lunch lost highway read p k <UNK> martian time split or <UNK> do watch the cell perfect blue dark city or play american <UNK> alice on pc and you may have a vague idea of what it's like don't watch the feel good movie of the month with banal situations <UNK> characters and visuals and stupid plot tricks the cell is the most accurate movie about a <UNK> mind his visions and his inner <UNK> it's violent weird confusing and very very scary br br once again <UNK> isn't about details it's not a neat tame trick played to you it jumps in your face and won't let you go walls fall apart people turn into strange hostile creatures you feel like you go <UNK> in time you're not sure you're who you think you are everything feels strange unnatural believe me this is much much more than what's depicted in this soap like melodrama
<START> what is this is it a comedy a horror movie or just nothing this is by far the worst movie i have ever seen especially the scene in romania when he becomes the werewolf that must be the worst scene that has ever been made this movie isn't funny it isn't scary and not entertaining at all please do yourself and me i don't think anyone should suffer through this movie a favour and don't watch this movie if you get is a present just throw it away and chop it in to pieces
<START> if anybody really wants to understand hitler read wwi history not wwii history find out what happened during that war how soldiers had to live around dead corpses all the time how so many soldiers went insane from what they saw during wwi at the time they called it <UNK> now the call it post traumatic stress disorder if you learn the true horrors of wwi you will begin to understand hitler you will understand how a human being can become <UNK> to death not because their evil but simply because it was the only way for them too cope with the horrors around them br br this movie unfortunately misses that as so many others do read some books on the subject and you should watch the movie paths of glory the only good wwi movie ever made you will see the frustration of the soldiers in that movie the sense of <UNK> and a utter <UNK> of human life as nothing more than bullet <UNK> br br thats what this movie misses its really the key point to understanding germany a lost war where millions and millions of germans lost their lives for no real reason then comes an utter economic collapse following the war those are the factors that create <UNK> br br the loss of family members and massive poverty will create always lead to <UNK> unfortunately this movie ignored these factors and has just become another throw away piece of crap to throw on the pile with really no real value there are fictional movie's based upon fictional characters that could give you a better idea of hitler than this does they just threw <UNK> name on this so it would sell more
<START> one of the most peculiar <UNK> used romance movie plots is this one a seriously messed up man falls in love with a <UNK> ill woman who turns his life around before dying occasionally this story is done well and realistically as in the theory of flight an excellent <UNK> but more frequently it's done like it is here where as usual the heroine dies of old movie disease you know the <UNK> illness that has no <UNK> but one <UNK> spell and a need to lie down as you're telling your lover goodbye forever and your looks aren't affected one bit and since this is the 70's neither is your sex life this is one of the worst versions made of that particular story where a very silly script puts two <UNK> and unbelievable characters together and they're played by actors who are completely at sea br br this has got to be the worst performance of al <UNK> career and i say that after having seen the devil's <UNK> only two days ago he plays a control freak emotionally <UNK> race car driver and plays an unlikeable character <UNK> he seems to constantly be asking himself why he's staying around the grating <UNK> <UNK> so does the audience and spends most of the movie just standing there usually with his mouth hanging open the only time he shows any sign of life is towards the end where his character proves that he's changed from uptight to <UNK> by doing a hilariously bad mae west imitation hey it was the seventies br br <UNK> <UNK> is equally terrible as the dying love interest her character was conceived as bold and free and touching and <UNK> and full of life even though dying and was probably meant to be played with an actress with the sensitivity of say vanessa redgrave or julie christie instead they got the <UNK> face and heavy german accent of ms <UNK> who comes across as more of a scary <UNK> stereotype you <UNK> eat <UNK> <UNK> than anything like lovable she's supposed to be <UNK> pacino and filling him with courage and spirit and all that but it doesn't work that way it's more like she's <UNK> on his faults in the most obnoxious possible fashion this makes for one of the least convincing romances in movie history where you can't believe she'd be with someone she finds so worthless and you can't believe he's with someone who gets on his nerves that much br br some bad movie fans call this a cult classic mostly because of <UNK> silly <UNK> mae west imitation the scene is a scream especially in context but not worth sitting through the rest of the film for no only see the film if you're a serious bad movie <UNK> who is especially interested in studying extreme lack of chemistry between leading actors or very bad casting not only are the leads terrible but <UNK> other girlfriend is played by an actress who looks and sounds just likes <UNK> with shorter hair i got them totally confused this isn't one of those laugh a minute bad movies like the <UNK> it's just a really really bad movie br br
<START> wow br br i just was given this film from a friend of mine who bought it for 1 98 at <UNK> and he felt that he got taken it is beyond boring most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen the acting is somewhat improvised almost as if they didn't have a script the martians are cgi which look like they were done by a <UNK> or a fan produced movie i cannot stress just how bad this dvd really is br br example in one of the scenes the martians are torturing a local female captive she goes from a woman in front of a green screen to a cgi copy of that woman the change is totally noticeable and when she is killed you can see that it is a computer figure looking like something from a game back in 1990 br br if at all possible avoid this movie like the plague you can <UNK> two trailers from their site and see how god awful it really is
<START> we've all been there sitting with some friends watching a bad movie laughing at how terribly it was made and how poor the acting was eventually the credits roll and everyone looks around and says how is it possible such a movie was made who paid money to have this script made into a feature film well jigsaw is not that kind of film instead of asking how this garbage was budgeted you wonder why the makers were shot out of a cannon into the sun yes jigsaw is quite possibly the worst movie ever made or conceived this coming from a guy who has seen <UNK> stories and fever lake the film starts out in some kind of college class what kind of class i am unsure but it is imagined to be an art class now these <UNK> have been given a final project by their idiot teacher five of them are given pieces of a <UNK> and told to design it in any way they see fit and since there are only five pieces the other students in the class receive and automatic a oddly enough there are only six students in this entire class so the one <UNK> <UNK> gets a free a good for her a week passes and the five students plus teacher plus one <UNK> husband meet in a bar to discuss their and complete their project they put the pieces together head arms legs and inform the others why they chose their <UNK> designs now these creative geniuses used the week to their full advantage one puts a saw blade in the left hand the other gets a <UNK> off shotgun the right leg gets a bunch of broken <UNK> glued to it and the left some magazine <UNK> the head is the worst getting a camera in the eye ala <UNK> 3 with some bottle rockets for a stylish mo <UNK> after they have all <UNK> their guts about their <UNK> designs the now drunk teacher says they are to burn the <UNK> now <UNK> named jigsaw now up to this point it has been standard horrible movie fair bad acting dialog and everything else but has still been pretty plausible yet after jigsaw catches fire things take a turn for the worst jigsaw comes alive how you ask i have no idea he just does because the writers couldn't think of a realistic way for two pounds worth of <UNK> plastic to become alive come on guys a <UNK> of lighting a traveling voodoo priest anything could have worked so once jigsaw comes to life he uses his new abilities of walking very slow and stilted with the use of his <UNK> fingers to <UNK> havoc first he kills the cool guy with some <UNK> wire this guy who was about to get it on with a hot <UNK> decides drinking ground beer off in the distance is more important than what is in front of him with him gone jigsaw shoots the sexy girl in the face and then gives an old man a heart attack with a slight twist of his head he then <UNK> up a nasty looking southern woman and then her <UNK> husband jigsaw then kills the nerdy guy with some <UNK> deception did i mention jigsaw was taking body parts off his victims to make a human version of himself no well its not important they don't even show his macabre creation they don't even show him steal away a <UNK> from his poor creators maybe he was trying to create the head detective from in living color so after these five have been killed the teacher and the nerdy girl are all who is left the teacher figures out that jigsaw only needs a head to finish his masterpiece since he is still <UNK> in that <UNK> thing so being the coward he is the teacher ties up the girl as a sacrifice to jigsaw who comes in only to go for the teacher with his electric buzz saw which isn't even <UNK> in that is where the freaking movie ends we don't even get to see the teacher get killed or what happens to the girl let alone an explanation why jigsaw came to life or how he <UNK> himself off after being burned this movie is so shameful it has too be seen it is only <UNK> minutes so it is a small part of your day for the memories of a lifetime jigsaw jigsaw jigsaw thank you total recall the judge has ruled watch jigsaw only if your plans of <UNK> off your <UNK> seems played out
<START> this film is notable for three reasons br br first apparently <UNK> on the success of the two <UNK> serials this low budget feature was made and released to theaters <UNK> george <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> initial appearances as clark kent superman and lois lane part of the opening is re used in the series outside the town of <UNK> a six mile deep oil well <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> allowing the <UNK> <UNK> to come to the surface forget about the other holes those in the plot br br second unlike most sf invasion films of the fifties the hero plays a <UNK> and controlling force in preaching and <UNK> tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of <UNK> <UNK> no <UNK> mannered <UNK> here clark kent <UNK> and self <UNK> grabs control of the situation throughout i'll handle this even <UNK> in a hospital <UNK> in the <UNK> of a bullet from a mole man as superman he is <UNK> than clark towards the <UNK> lois but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he <UNK> against the <UNK> as nazi storm troopers br br third you will notice that the transition from the <UNK> like cartoon animated flying of superman in the two serials to the <UNK> <UNK> flying in the <UNK> of <UNK> had not yet been made
<START> essentially a story of man versus nature this film has beautiful cinematography the lush <UNK> of <UNK> and the presence of elizabeth taylor but the film really never gets going <UNK> taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the <UNK> <UNK> played by dana andrews the plantation is under the spell of owner peter <UNK> late father whose ghost casts a <UNK> over elephant walk that becomes a major point of <UNK> between taylor and <UNK> the elephants are determined to <UNK> their traditional path to water that was <UNK> when the mansion was built across their right of way the <UNK> go on a rampage and provides the best moments of action in the picture taylor and andrews have some good moments as she struggles to remain a faithful wife in spite of he marital difficulties with <UNK>
<START> i read the book a long time back and don't specifically remember the plot but do remember that i enjoyed it since i'm home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and hey it is a lifetime movie br br the movie is populated with grade b actors and actresses br br the female cast is right out of desperate <UNK> i've never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and i get the <UNK> is there nothing original anymore sure but not on lifetime br br the male cast are all fairly <UNK> looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands i suppose br br in one scene a female is struggling with a male for her life and what does she do kicks him in the <UNK> what else women love that but let me tell you girls something it's not as easy as it's always made to look br br it wasn't all bad i did get the chills a time or two so i have to credit someone with that
<START> i had to walk out on this film fifteen minutes from the end having passed through the cringe stage and into pure boredom what really <UNK> me i mean truly <UNK> me is that there are people referring to this <UNK> drivel as <UNK> or a <UNK> see ' i would feel deep pity for those so <UNK> were it not for the distinct impression that most of the positive comments about this shallow and <UNK> travesty were written by industry plants br br the truth is this is a lame film that does nothing to entertain nor <UNK> it is decidedly unfunny poorly scripted and has all the pace and energy of cold <UNK> rice <UNK> to be kind to ms kramer the best one can say is it was a missed opportunity for having read the synopsis before i watched it i had expected something more challenging the possible <UNK> of a close brother and sister co <UNK> the unexpected awakening of <UNK> sexuality and the comic potential in such sibling rivalry for the affections of the same girl were all obvious subjects for refreshing comedic exploration yet which at every turn the movie <UNK> <UNK> away from br br instead the audience is subjected to a meandering series of uninspired and <UNK> drawn situations with clichéd <UNK> and dull performances from a cast struggling for belief and obviously in need of much <UNK> direction the lack of directorial control seems astounding on the one hand <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> all give very pedestrian performances while heather graham and molly shannon the latter in particular <UNK> towards embarrassing over <UNK> at times one could lay the blame for this on the director maybe sue kramer hopes that if her actors over act they will force a bigger laugh from the audience but then again the cast is a veteran one one would expect them to do better br br sue kramer really needs to think carefully what kind of movies she wants to make and for whom given the possible issues gray matters <UNK> to and given her inability or <UNK> to fully explore them in the context of a comedy perhaps she should consider writing dramas instead i know it is never easy to make films about women and women's issues especially when one hopes to reach a wider audience than women alone but whatever direction she takes <UNK> and flimsy characters like gray are not going to cut <UNK>
<START> written on the wind is a douglas <UNK> melodrama douglas sirk was <UNK> by the <UNK> du cinema fassbinder etc that <UNK> him as a master director i think that it is because of the sophistication of his cinematography written on the wind offers <UNK> color images and gorgeous <UNK> but i ask myself is this enough to carry a film the acting in written on the wind <UNK> from weak to fair <UNK> robert stack he is convincing as the weak spoiled playboy lauren bacall normally a powerful presence in the screen is miscast in this film dorothy malone as the <UNK> the care free femme fatale is ok but she lacks the strength for the role rock hudson is efficient but vapid br br the plot has very interesting ingredients the main characters are br br a rigid <UNK> br br his alcoholic son kyle robert stack never loved by the disappointed father br br his frustrated and <UNK> daughter <UNK> dorothy malone br br lucy lauren bacall a woman of principles <UNK> a secretary and now married to kyle br br mitch rock hudson brought up together with kyle and loved by the <UNK> br br secrets beyond the door a love triangle frustration <UNK> laughter death etc well when i read the story summary on the back cover of the dvd i thought that i was in for a treat my mistake why i'll try to explain written on the wind takes itself seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story as i said before the acting in general is not good enough the intensity is lacking there are many strong scenes in the story but the actors just do an efficient job i think that maybe with italian or spanish actors those scenes would have been explored fully they would end for us in an explosion of laughter or tears br br what remains to us is the beautiful cinematography of douglas sirk for me this is not enough if you want to enjoy a good melodrama see <UNK>
<START> i am a relative <UNK> to the <UNK> work of film auteur <UNK> <UNK> whose masterfully understated views of japanese life especially in the post wwii era <UNK> universal truths having now seen several of his landmark films such as <UNK> late spring and <UNK> tokyo story i am convinced that <UNK> had a particularly <UNK> gift of conveying the range of feelings <UNK> from <UNK> conflict through <UNK> <UNK> and subtle imagery it is <UNK> director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> keen <UNK> to pay homage to <UNK> on his <UNK> with this generally <UNK> 2003 film among with co screenwriter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> appears to get the visuals right but does not capture the requisite emotional weight that would have made the <UNK> pacing tolerable br br the story concerns <UNK> a young japanese writer <UNK> the life of mid 20th century <UNK> composer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in tokyo after coming back from <UNK> where she taught japanese after 25 drawn out minutes of character set up she reveals to her father and stepmother that she is pregnant by one of her students in <UNK> at the same time <UNK> <UNK> friend <UNK> who runs a used <UNK> has an obsession for trains and seems likely to be in love with her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this slim plot line with a series of shots held for <UNK> lengthy takes as the frame composition changes there are also long stretches of silence as well as an abundance of scenes featuring trains while these techniques are consistent with <UNK> style <UNK> <UNK> cannot seem to dive into the characters' <UNK> the way <UNK> did with <UNK> <UNK> and minimal <UNK> in particular <UNK> plight seems rather non <UNK> in the scheme of the drama presented and her parents' reaction overly passive to hold much interest in fact the whole film has an atmosphere of <UNK> about it which makes the film feel interminable br br the performances are <UNK> though hardly memorable j pop music star <UNK> <UNK> brings a natural ease to <UNK> while <UNK> <UNK> is something of a <UNK> as <UNK> the rest of the characters barely register even <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> parents cinematographer lee <UNK> bing provides expert work though he <UNK> a <UNK> rule of <UNK> films by not keeping the camera stable during shots <UNK> speak sings the <UNK> pop song used over he ending credits <UNK> <UNK> the dvd includes an hour long french made documentary <UNK> <UNK> which actually does help provide some of the context for <UNK> <UNK> approach to the film it includes <UNK> from <UNK> films in particular <UNK> flower to show the parallels with this film though surprisingly no mention of either tokyo story or early summer the obvious basis for some of the scenes and situation set ups there are also edited interview clips of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as well as the film's trailer
<START> i can't really say what i think about this movie its against the <UNK> i've watched many many films and this has got to be the worst one yet extremely low budget i'm guessing all the money went into the slaughter house scenes cause i could of did a better job with a b w <UNK> camera and a crew of monkeys it was so bad i <UNK> just to leave a comment cause i had to tell someone movie rental place wasn't enough but this is my 2 cents worth i suggest <UNK> it from some poor <UNK> who rented it and watch it yourself cause i sure wouldn't waste the money on it myself again now i leave you with this comment i hope your not made at the rental place when they wont <UNK> you your money
<START> this is hardly a movie at all but rather a real vaudeville show filmed for the most part in <UNK> and starring some of the greatest stage stars of the day singing in the <UNK> is an absolutely amazing production number that must be seen be sure to wear your shower cap
<START> spoiler this movie is about such a concept williams will go to any low in order to replay the football game that <UNK> his life <UNK> plays the ex jock who <UNK> in high school finally the under dog get its shot and williams can save face instead of being the clown a great reverse tragedy 7 10
<START> this inept adaptation of arguably one of martin <UNK> weaker novels fails to even draw comparisons with other <UNK> <UNK> such as <UNK> for a dream or anything penned by <UNK> walsh as it struggles to decide whether it is a slap stick cartoon or a hyper realistic <UNK> br br <UNK> directed by william <UNK> in over <UNK> <UNK> a group of public school drop outs <UNK> in a mansion awaiting the appearance of three american friends for a weekend of <UNK> drug taking and that's it except for the ludicrous sub plot soon to be the main plot nonsense about an <UNK> cult group who express themselves with the violent killings of the world's elite figures be it political or <UNK> within the first reel you know exactly where this is going br br what is a talented actor like paul <UNK> doing in this tiresome badly written bore made prior to his rise to fame and jennifer <UNK> one can be assured that had he been offered this garbage now he'd have immediately changed agents avoid
<START> muscular man ape in the <UNK> of africa is hunted by an <UNK> expedition team the <UNK> daughter of the <UNK> leader finds him first much <UNK> version of the tarzan tale has an ok production but is crippled by the single <UNK> worst direction of a film i have ever seen john derek is <UNK> of inspiration beyond cheesy slow motion action shots and <UNK> a boo glimpses of wife bo <UNK> <UNK> body he has about as much talent behind the camera as ed wood trying for tongue in cheek sexuality the <UNK> lack <UNK> snappy timing and taste they have a sense of self parody and <UNK> <UNK> they do throw caution to the winds but after a promising opening it all goes to hell miles <UNK> who possibly had <UNK> in his mouth the entire time has the title role but plays third <UNK> to john <UNK> ego and bo <UNK> sense of self importance from
<START> the director and two stars of laura 1944 were <UNK> for this solid <UNK> dana andrews is the son of a criminal who becomes a cop to cut all ties with the past but cannot keep his inherited violent ways in check while <UNK> suspects and one night he goes too far gene tierney is the estranged wife of his victim a <UNK> war hero who has become involved with the town's leading <UNK> and <UNK> no 1 nemesis gary <UNK> who had himself been the <UNK> of andrews <UNK> as usual with preminger this is a well crafted movie with a notable opening credits sequence and <UNK> by a good cast that also includes karl malden as <UNK> <UNK> superior tom <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> mouth taxi driver dad and <UNK> brand as <UNK> chief thug with notable support also coming from craig stevens as the slimy wife beating victim bert freed as <UNK> sympathetic partner and robert f nolan as <UNK> stern <UNK> superior having already been warned by the latter to <UNK> his ways or else andrews <UNK> and <UNK> stevens for a couple of hours following his murder to put the police on the in this case wrong tracks of <UNK> however after <UNK> becomes the prime suspect by which time andrews and tierney are <UNK> involved the cop goes by himself in <UNK> <UNK> fully <UNK> to get <UNK> off and <UNK> the <UNK> for his own murder clearly the protagonist is a complex character and andrews rises to the challenge with a first rate characterization that is typically <UNK> by the in house fox noir style
<START> the beautiful story of stardust is written by by neil <UNK> writer of <UNK> and it's really a good story i think it would appeal to any <UNK> princess bride or <UNK> kingdom fan and yet it's totally unique and stands up on it's own and i feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by neil <UNK> i won't spoil it for you br br the main character <UNK> <UNK> in the novel is the son of a mortal and a <UNK> slave kept by a witch in the realm of <UNK> the story begins in a town near a wall that <UNK> the magical world from the human world when there is a falling star <UNK> promises to retrieve it for a girl he is <UNK> with he is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again and some <UNK> <UNK> br br it's a really good story it has humor and magic and beautiful surreal scenes and visuals it's charming and i feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages it's simply magical it's a true classic fairy tale the likes of which i haven't seen in cinema since the 1980s
<START> this film was excellent i thought that the original one was quiet mediocre this one however got all the ingredients a factory 1970 <UNK> <UNK> with 4 speed <UNK> that really shows that mother <UNK> knew how to build the best muscle cars i was in <UNK> heaven every time <UNK> <UNK> that big block <UNK> and he sure did that a lot
<START> this movie is inspiring to anyone who is or has been in a tough jam whether <UNK> or emotionally you will definitely laugh which is the best medicine left in a bad financial situation when her husband dies grace has to find a new way to make some money and it's not exactly legal which adds to the humour even my boyfriend liked it so don't think that it's a chick <UNK>
<START> i really wish i could give this a negative vote because i think i just wasted <UNK> minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever put to film the acting was just god awful i mean <UNK> bad the dialog was worse the script sounded like it was written by i can't think of anything horrible enough to say and the day outside and the night inside shots make you think the events took over several days terribly acted directed written etc etc all the way down to the <UNK> how gets lunch for everyone stay away from this one at all costs if my only saving grace to stay out of hell is by doing one good deed it is to tell the world to not watch this crap this movie is the exact reason why horror movies are never taken seriously
<START> heads hands and feet a band from the past just like strange fruit a triple <UNK> there those who have <UNK> not to like this film are either heartless or under 40 and have had no experience of the real thing sad for them this is an <UNK> well observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two and will probably not even fade much on the second showing stephen <UNK> timothy <UNK> as the fat drummer in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all and bill <UNK> a new name for me as the neurotic <UNK> and front man all turn in super performances and juliet <UNK> has lovely <UNK> eyes to go with some sharp acting as karen who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self <UNK> br br the <UNK> <UNK> brian wilson echoes are loud and clear <UNK> the <UNK> rear up before one in all their <UNK> <UNK> and the script is never <UNK> for more than a minute don't compare this with spinal tap or the <UNK> or the full monty it's unfair on all of them the nearest comparison is the <UNK> and that's no bad thing and any film that can <UNK> up memories of <UNK> pig a band i do not remember ever seeing but the name lives on well it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on about br br a small delight and thanks for the memory br br oh and i've got another one stiff little fingers a a and what about <UNK> span spooky tooth ten inch nails anyone you have to see the movie or have been on the road
<START> bad actors bad filming choppy dialog shallow characters but then again it was a bad premise in the first place basically an 11 year old who is <UNK> because he has very little money is given a blank check by a moronic criminal of course the 11 year old happens to possess enough technology and intelligence to purchase a house cash a check for 1 000 000 dollars and even foil three bumbling idiots reminiscent of the three stooges br br preston blake is an annoying obnoxious boy who decides that when written a blank check by a complete stranger he will take advantage of the situation as best as he can in other words he wanders into a bank br br hands a <UNK> a check he makes in his <UNK> and miraculously walks out with a million bucks in cash preston is also apparently capable of reaching incredible <UNK> on his <UNK> due to the fact that a man driving a <UNK> after preston and his 10 speed could not catch him even when preston jumped a row of cars br br of course with every hokey adventure movie there has to be hot heroine in this case our hot heroine is a child <UNK> fbi agent who dates the eleven year old preston and promises another date when he turns 17 br br however the absolute worst aspect of this film was not its casting nor its sloppy dialog such as the only other way i could think of <UNK> a cat is to stick a <UNK> up it's butt and then pick up the fur it was rather the entire fact that nobody in the entire film seemed to realize that the fbi does not give a damn about random people what i have failed to explain is that preston uses the <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> as an <UNK> of sorts of course the fbi finds this intriguing and sends our young heroine after preston who uses his 11 year old wit to first scream when <UNK> fall on his face then treat her to <UNK> finishing with a ridiculous romp through a <UNK> area where water <UNK> from the ground our heroine fails to realize during this whole adventure that the criminal the fbi is pursuing is <UNK> and <UNK> right behind the two as they make their way to <UNK> <UNK> complete with a 1 dimensional driver who never fails to provide cheap 3rd rate laughs that the whole family can choke on br br overall 1 10 is incredibly <UNK> for this film i don't see how it only has a 4 4 10
<START> in this muppet movie <UNK> miss <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dr teeth <UNK> animal <UNK> and <UNK> are college <UNK> who decide to bring their successful college musical manhattan <UNK> to broadway unfortunately no producer will even meet with the muppets after being denied by too many producers <UNK> suggests that the muppets decide to move on on their own however <UNK> still believes that he can get his show on broadway but after he finally does and let's everybody know that he sold the show <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the others don't know where he is br br this features many great scenes including a live action sequence that introduced the muppet babies a wedding sequence filled with muppets including the <UNK> street cast and traveling matt from <UNK> rock <UNK> as a movie theatre <UNK> and a scene where rizzo and the other rats cook breakfast br br my only complaint is that more characters weren't included more sure many of them appear at the wedding but there should have been some significant roles for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and lips should have been part of the electric mayhem in this movie like he was in the muppet show's last season and the great muppet caper and miss <UNK> dog <UNK> <UNK> should have been with her as well after all rizzo the rat also performed by steve <UNK> had a big part in this movie and he wasn't very well known at the time
<START> dave <UNK> <UNK> and his friends sam jason <UNK> and jeff michael <UNK> have <UNK> their way through college when creepy ethan jason <UNK> discovers their secret he <UNK> them into helping him score with beautiful good hearted student angela james king br br stupid and incompetent comedy a lot more <UNK> inducing than laugh inducing movie tries appealing to its target audience with its disgusting gags but none of them work what's more it's full of worthless unappealing characters and <UNK> character is so repulsive he's a major turn off movie even tries using 50's 60's <UNK> actress <UNK> van <UNK> in the movie's most outrageous scene <UNK> br br further bringing it down are its utter predictability and the waste yet again of veteran comedic actor joe <UNK> talent <UNK> this guy going to stop accepting every role that comes along and do something worthwhile br br all in all the only thing i liked was james a k a <UNK> king who was very appealing and deserved better br br this gets no more than one out of ten from me
<START> this movie is so misunderstood it is not even funny if you think of seeing this one for the shootings stay clear this one deals with the effects and trauma that the survivors must endure even the detectives are seeking the answer we all do why fantastic acting from the two leading ladies as we see how those we ignore are affected by the very same things we are affected with yes the language is harsh at times but it suits the characters well there are some loose ends left or unanswered but all movies have these the major issues are dealt with and this movie makes a major statement about how all of us adults feel after such major incidents highly recommended for teens and adults
<START> what can i say about this film other than don't see it i waited and waited and waited for <UNK> or anything to happen and it just didn't come watch amazingly as two people walk around while setting the record for most filler screen time in a single movie what are they doing are they solving a mystery are they gathering clues possibly it's just hard to tell at the end of the movie after a lot of radio <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> on some sort of pet <UNK> and this guy gives some <UNK> the plot is finally revealed and tossed aside as quickly as possible some aliens want to get back to their home world <UNK> and are so happy there that they want to blow up the earth i guess they don't like sharing the wealth my guess is they finished filming and saw their 35 minute work or art garbage and decided that they'd let the editing crew turn it into an <UNK> minute feature film watch at your own peril it's not even funny because it's so bad it's just bad
<START> this series it's something different sometimes european series are less accurate than the usa ones but this time authors have hit the right target creating a mix that works in a smoothly way <UNK> <UNK> is great it has all great plot smart witty always well delivered lines an amazing theatrical timing showed by all the stars and beautiful shots of berlin one of the most interesting city in the world it's entertaining to see how things works in the justice field in other countries than the usa and for once feel the old europe way of dealing with life kudos to all the cast and crew for a well done comedy that is going to be a must to see in the years to come watching the series in german is super
<START> comes this heartwarming tale of hope hope that you'll never have to endure anything this awful again <UNK> <UNK> award <UNK> br br i disliked this movie because it was unfunny predictable and inane while watching i felt like i was in a psychology experiment to determine how low movie standards could get before people complained when i <UNK> my money back at the end of the movie i was informed that because i watched the whole thing 'i wasn't entitled to <UNK> i was told by the assistant manager that several people had complained and gotten <UNK> already though br br the movie summary is pretty basic the midget thief steals a diamond and the poses as a baby to <UNK> police underneath this clever outline however lies a <UNK> of original fresh and hilarious skits or not br br ask yourself the following do you like to see people getting hit by pans do you like fart jokes do you like to see <UNK> posing as babies threatened with a <UNK> in the <UNK> do you like tired racial jokes do you think babies say <UNK> goo goo goo goo <UNK> <UNK> do you <UNK> br br if you answered <UNK> to any of the above then this movie is definitely for you although it has been billed in some places as 'the worst movie of the <UNK> there is probably a movie or 2 that are worse somewhere i can't say for sure i gave this movie 2 stars because we all know a review with only one star would indicate bias on the part of the reviewer and then the review wouldn't be taken seriously br br this <UNK> comedy is intended for a less intelligent audience and i cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone save your money for something funny br br respect
<START> ugh this is a terrible film full of disastrous comic relief no scares and scary leaps in story and <UNK> the only creepy thing here is the leading <UNK> hats lugosi was on his downhill slide and it shows i give this a 1 and this ain't no fun
<START> i have seen <UNK> still happen now at least four times i never tire of this fantastic movie from the very beginning it holds a person's interest as the movie progresses and the plane crashes the story becomes very intense as we watch this young girl trying to survive alone and frightened in the amazon following a plane crash in which she was the only survivor losing her mother in this plane crash as well makes this movie even more dramatic as we see the <UNK> this young girl had to endure during her ten days in the amazon to think this really did happen is just unreal and to think that anyone could <UNK> survive this is <UNK> as we see the wild animals snakes and other <UNK> the enormous <UNK> and <UNK> as well as countless insects as the movie progresses we see the many dangers this girl has to face as she tries to follow the river in hopes of it leading her to a town remembering what her father told her about how a stream will always lead to a river and then into an even larger river and this means it will eventually lead to a community this young girl keep track of the tiny stream which eventually lead into a huge river all throughout the movie at times having to swim in dangerous waters alone frightened injured she always managed to keep going towards the end of this movie it was obvious she would not have been able to continue much longer as she had not eaten in ten days and only had water to drink and was very sick and tired from her <UNK> eventually as she sees a <UNK> she realizes there has to be a village and men find her and they take care of her and then take her to a hospital where her father comes to see her after <UNK> she was dead along with the many other passengers such a dramatic movie and so heartwarming to see her father's face when he sees his daughter is actually still alive after all this time in the amazon movies like this aren't made much those days i will still see it again and i know i will never tire of it to think this girl was the only one single survivor of this airplane is just <UNK> also the fact she only <UNK> a few very slight <UNK> was even more remarkable whereas everyone else on this airplane <UNK> in the horrific crash into the <UNK> of the amazon a brilliant movie superbly acted out indeed and one i will treasure forever and love to continue watching strongly recommended by me for sure
<START> i wasn't terribly impressed with <UNK> 1st season offering in <UNK> it wasn't much of a horror story but rather a smart political statement with the undead <UNK> situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men's sexual drive to replaced with murderous <UNK> toward women the episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home i assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the <UNK> but is unclear because this is never <UNK> the episode go <UNK> for a while introducing characters blah blah blah it seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it <UNK> forward until its sad and unsatisfying end the worst episode well except for chocolate
<START> this barely watchable film was a bit of an ordeal to sit through none of the segments are good but at least the first one was mildly amusing and the middle one was somewhat imaginative the final one was just plain brutal and after sitting through two weak comedic shorts the third one was truly painful to watch even by the low standards of a national lampoon movie this one seemed especially boring and <UNK>
<START> i have just lost three hours of my life to this travesty and i can honestly say i feel <UNK> i had read the reviews and heard the <UNK> and i thought i was prepared for anything at best i thought a faithful if misguided attempt at an original adaptation at worst a so good it's bad plan 9 for the new millennium so when i managed to pick up a copy in <UNK> while in florida and brought it back to the uk i <UNK> to my friends prepare for the worst movie ever made oh cruel <UNK> there is absolutely nothing to recommend this film the special effects look like the work of a first year design student using a spectrum <UNK> the acting is terrible the accents are worse than terrible one <UNK> <UNK> accent seems to take us on a tour of the british <UNK> from scotland to <UNK> via northern ireland the dialogue is stilted the editing is non existent the production values prove that no expense has been gone to words really cannot describe how bad this movie is from the union flag flying from the horribly <UNK> <UNK> the royal navy flies the white <UNK> not the union flag to the <UNK> ridden acting this is quite simply a crime against film making when you consider some of the literally zero budget fan films that are available on the <UNK> the star wars short troops for example the whole we're enthusiastic amateurs argument goes right out of the window and if you believe an interview with hines on the <UNK> website this film had an 8 figure budget i can only assume that dodgy facial hair does not come cheap in the us maybe the problem is that hines co tried to make a film of the book rather than turn the book into a film if that makes any sense characters and extras <UNK> <UNK> of text <UNK> without trying to convey the feelings behind the words ironically enough the only person who even came close to giving a decent performance was <UNK> sellers the ex soft porn actress my advice pray like crazy that jeff wayne doesn't screw up and go watch the spielberg version it may not be true to the text of the book but i can say this as a <UNK> <UNK> wells fan and <UNK> as well <UNK> film is true to the spirit of the book maybe customs were wrong to let me carry this monster into the country but i will say this timothy hines stole three hours of my life and i want them back
<START> this is absolutely the worst movie i've seen all year br br first i will say that the acting was very good and by all of the cast br br this was apparently meant to be very offbeat and in that regard it succeeded by the same token the story revolves around a self centered wannabe who is a clueless talentless <UNK> liar whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather <UNK> br br this was worse than watching a car wreck
<START> contains spoiler with the possible exception of john wayne no other actor sat <UNK> in the <UNK> in westerns than james stewart and this movie proves it this superb tale of revenge centered around a winchester rifle has only one weak spot i can think of the casting of will <UNK> as a very <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> the casting of the villains was good stephen <UNK> as <UNK> dutch henry dan duryea as <UNK> johnny dean and john mcintire versatile at playing both good guys and bad guys as a slick gun runner the showdown between stewart and <UNK> on the <UNK> is great i'd stack this western against the whole crop of westerns made today they wouldn't stand a chance
<START> i have no idea how imdb sorts reviews but i do know that as happens often on amazon com there are a striking number of very negative reviews for this movie which repeat the same somewhat obscure talking points almost <UNK> a campaign only imdb knows br br as for this movie it's fine it's a funny cute and very straightforward movie br br it's been over a decade since i worked in brooklyn lived in queens and visited relatives in the south <UNK> but i found nothing <UNK> or exploitative about these kids is the grandmother a bizarre character <UNK> do the dialogue and plot acknowledge this yes thankfully they do are other movies set in the les and featuring <UNK> puerto <UNK> kids possible you <UNK> does that make this movie a crime  as some of the to my eyes <UNK> comments would suggest hardly let a thousand plastic flowers bloom br br this is better than any episode of <UNK> jr high or <UNK> high <UNK> at the comparison but we've never had that and i'm touched to the core by this movie's <UNK> of purpose and tender spirit br br that said i'd love to know the <UNK> behind all this <UNK> d
<START> so i'm at home flipping channels one night and i come across this man wearing heels and makeup standing in front of a colored background on hbo naturally i did a double take and decided i'd watch for a little while i didn't change the channel until he was finished it was so incredibly hilarious the next time it was on i made sure to tape it so i could watch it over and over again and it has remained one of my favorite things to watch during the first couple of minutes you can tell that the audience isn't quite sure what to think but he quickly wins them over with his incredible humor and wit while many stand up comedians <UNK> together in my brain eddie izzard stands out as one of the best his style is incredibly refreshing and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and <UNK> when most comedians stick to current events his show stayed with me afterwards i went to italy over the summer and all i could think about while i was there was how italians are always on <UNK> going <UNK> ' 10 out of 10 see it you won't regret it
<START> i watched the whole movie waiting and waiting for something to actually happen maybe it's my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology is it a weird re telling of the <UNK> myth i want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and <UNK> musical theater with him i didn't understand why certain plot elements were even present why was the construction upstairs why was there that big <UNK> with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their doom if no one was actually going to do so why have the scenes at all with the father at work why have such a nice kitchen if you're only going to eat <UNK> why would the boy want to be <UNK> and the parents be the ones to resist instead of the other way around i see lots of good reviews for this movie has my taste been <UNK> by going up with 70s b movies and old sci fi flicks
<START> what a waste this movie could have really been something decent but the writing in particular is crap and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting mike meyers was good and the historical recreation of late 70s <UNK> was well crafted but overall this movie was a big waste of time instead the movie to watch that deals with similar themes and the same basic time frame is the great boogie nights
<START> this film should have been only 10 minutes i mean there is really only 10 minute worth of watchable content in this thing i even hesitate to call it a movie the opening credits of the film was somehow promising as the film begins by short comments of the man himself you really rub your hands and stay tuned for more footage from <UNK> life well nick cave does a reasonable job covering one of <UNK> famous songs the length of <UNK> performance makes you even more eager to see more of cohen whose wit and well spoken words have already <UNK> your fancy but as it turns out <UNK> performance is only the start of lengthy super boring performances by literally a bunch of no ones who don't even have a minimal attraction to keep you on your seat i mean what does the filmmaker really think five minute close up shots of wanna be singers in a fake concert in australia what does the filmmaker really think to insult the audience by adding fake applause to these endless nasty performances the film is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you came to see there is not a single footage of <UNK> past in fact except for a few photographs of his early days as a singer poet there is absolutely nothing if you add up all the minutes that cohen talks it may not even reach 10 minutes but these 10 minutes are <UNK> presented bit by bit in between disastrous camera work that captures some of the most unattractive people screaming <UNK> lyrics if you ever decided to waste your money on this film don't just throw it in the garbage and at least save your time
<START> after reading the book which had a lot of meaning for me the movie didn't give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed this makes me wonder if kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else either that or he is simply bad most importantly where is the <UNK> from the very first scene music <UNK> out most of the dialogue and feeling and this continues right through the movie i think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie this would make the story feel light however they have completely failed here instead the music manages to give everything that <UNK> <UNK> in a way <UNK> events so that we <UNK> on them so that everything actually feels heavy br br another example of the how this adaptation fails is by <UNK> the story line making it more dramatic in the movie we see <UNK> passing <UNK> on the street who is on his way to see <UNK> the introduction of this chance meeting passing which im sure didn't happen in the book gives <UNK> story more significance than it does make it light br br there are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed imo for the worst however this might have been done because the book simply doesn't <UNK> well into a movie such is <UNK> style this makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book and movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film a film which is as long as it is <UNK> for those who haven't read the book yet i recommend just reading that for those who have i have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stay clear <UNK>
<START> are you a <UNK> ask john to <UNK> and she sure of <UNK> well responds him yes in this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who don't know each other and at the same time the questions and doubts in birthday girl a film that i heard a lot of times but i don't dare to see until two hours of write this br br birthday girl is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count at the same time that nicole kidman is one of the best actress besides she is pretty and intelligent that i have ever seen birthday girl is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet the woman that he finds comes from russia she seems to be that delicate woman normal not more one day in her birthday comes suddenly his cousin and his friend the man begin to discover certain things since here he don't going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been br br much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don't novel but birthday girl is just the opposite this movie is full of good surprises good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined this romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of <UNK> for the films of it kind birthday girl have certain beauty and <UNK> in its scenes but at the same time certain touching nature and makes it so deeper br br birthday girl is sometimes sad sometimes funny sometimes violent but at the end is totally satisfactory and i'm not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece br br sorry for the mistakes well if there any
<START> i was always a big fan of this movie first of all have you seen the cast the acting is superb and help make this movie move along very well <UNK> shepherd was given great reviews for her role and they were well deserved the beginning of this movie starts in the past when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> whose picture perfect marriage comes to a shattering halt when her husband <UNK> dies unexpectedly fortunately <UNK> gets a second shot at life when he agrees to be recycled back to earth as the <UNK> alex <UNK> robert downey jr alex goes on to live his new life forgetting his past life while <UNK> tries to get on with hers but fate crosses <UNK> path 23 years later when he meets <UNK> daughter miranda mary stuart masterson and is suddenly <UNK> with a wealth of <UNK> memories this is where the fun begins and embarrassing situations occur the music is great and the scenes are heart felt and very cute you wont be disappointed if you give it a chance chances are you'll like it very funny and sweet
<START> i go to <UNK> and take some classes with the executive producer alison <UNK> she's a superb teacher and director so anything she put her name on i thought must be pretty good this film as a selection at the santa barbara film festival seemed like a good choice br br while this movie included some nice shots and cinematography the lack of story and <UNK> really took away from anything the it was attempting to accomplish my main problem was that this was someone's first film and you could obviously tell bad acting and an even worse screenplay stopped this film from getting off the ground the soundtrack had some nice music that gave a sense of the main characters struggle to cope with the sadness that lead to his leaving and now returning the place he grew up i just have to say that despite some of the better craft of the film it's lack of story and performance really prevented it from being some good
<START> this is a feel good movie and nothing more and for that it is great fun to watch sure it <UNK> over political issues but so what i am sure she wasn't trying to make <UNK> night and good <UNK> here let's not try to make it anything else but what it is light fare br br and very enjoyable at that br br do we remember what 1984 was like we've become very sophisticated according to the media as far as what we watch or not i tend to <UNK> on this point goldie knew this was fun fluff and she went ahead and did it br br like her <UNK> fare <UNK> overboard <UNK> <UNK> private benjamin seems like old times foul play death becomes her first wives club and the remake of out of <UNK> goldie knows what she is doing she plays every role for the camp that you can get out of it goldie just knows herself really well and she knows what she can do really well br br she has always made me laugh <UNK> and <UNK> i loved her in laugh in and every thing she's ever been in she has never tried to be anything else but who she is and that's that <UNK> <UNK> girl next door who happens to be very pretty and has a smile and a laugh that will always <UNK> me and remind me that life is pretty short and you've just got to <UNK> up because before you know it you are old <UNK> and suffering from one of life's inevitable <UNK> if it even comes that late br br i appreciate goldie for what she is a lovable comic actress
<START> the vampire bat is set in the small german village of <UNK> where <UNK> <UNK> lionel <UNK> the <UNK> is holding a meeting with inspector karl <UNK> melvyn douglas from the local <UNK> about all the recent murders six victims have been discovered in as many weeks all <UNK> of blood bearing the same two <UNK> wounds on their <UNK> <UNK> doesn't have a single clue but the <UNK> <UNK> of the village believe the deaths to be the work of a vampire <UNK> isn't convinced but the scared villagers keep telling tales of seeing a large bat meanwhile the latest victim martha <UNK> rita <UNK> has been found <UNK> comes under increasing pressure to solve the murders but can he really believe that a giant vampire bat is responsible if it is <UNK> he going to stop it br br directed by frank r <UNK> the vampire bat was a <UNK> from <UNK> pictures to cash in on the success of it's two stars <UNK> <UNK> their success in the previous years doctor x 1932 is more of a murder mystery rather than a horror as the exploitative <UNK> title may have lead you to believe quite frankly it's rather dull the script by edward t lowe jr takes itself rather seriously sets up the basic story that something is killing local villagers that something could possibly be a vampire then for most of it's duration the film focuses on <UNK> his incompetent <UNK> which are not to put too fine a point on it boring the vampire bat also has a bit of an identity crisis as it doesn't quite know what it wants to be the title would suggest a horror film while the majority of it could easily be described as a thriller with the final few minutes <UNK> into silly sci fi there is no vampire bat the attempts to fool you are pathetic all the character's are broad stereotypes you can tell the villain of the piece straight away as a whole there is nothing particularly exciting or entertaining about the vampire bat i know it's old but that's not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933 a bland flat dull boring misleading film such as the vampire bat just doesn't cut it these days just look at the original king kong 1933 released the same year how brilliantly that still holds up today i didn't like it i doubt many modern film goers would either it's as simple straight forward as that br br director <UNK> doesn't do anything special but this is a case in point where i can cut the film some slack because of it's age as a whole it's pretty much point shoot hope for the best stuff there isn't much in the way of atmosphere or scares although some of the sets which were already existing ones taken from the old dark house 1932 <UNK> european set on their back lot are nice add a certain ambiance to things br br technically the vampire bat can't compare to anything even remotely modern for the age of it it's alright i suppose but again i draw your attention back to the original king kong speaking of king kong it's star fay <UNK> has a role in this as does horror icon lionel <UNK> i'll be kind say the acting is ok br br the vampire bat will i imagine fool a lot of people into thinking that it's a horror film about vampire bats when in fact it isn't personally i thought the whole thing was a bit of a bore it's short it tells it's story reasonably enough but i must admit i'm not a fan
<START> i question its importance to <UNK> cinema as it seems to be more about having a homosexual encounter via violent behavior than making any clear statements regarding homosexuality and violence br br three tales are <UNK> together in a rather sloppy manner i found myself trying to <UNK> the messy narrative in the first 15 minutes that alone didn't sit well with me weak plot points were endlessly repeated as though we might not have gotten it the first 10 times br br there was a feeling of padded dialog throughout the film more like a 45 minute boy's brief short rather than a fleshed out full length film it had a certain erotic flair male nudity and sex appeal but overall the sum did not equal its parts br br the 1st part boxer stalker storyline was the strongest and yet it too felt like it had been pulled thin bob has been following tim for four years and only now is he confronting him i felt as though their cat mouse game was not developed enough to merit its conclusion we needed more information about them and less parking lot locker scenes with tim relentlessly saying what do you want br br the 2nd part danny wants his buddy tony to beat him up while he <UNK> off tony doesn't seem to mind but he doesn't even appear interested in exploring the <UNK> of his <UNK> erotic <UNK> not even after they do it in the nude this tale lacks the all important transition from i'm a straight boy <UNK> my guy friend around for fun to i think i might be gay and hitting him because i'd like to spread his ass and do him s m style a very important thing to leave out br br clearly these stories each could have conveyed their points in half the time the 3rd part with the man and woman <UNK> each other around adds to that thought furthermore it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film yes the actors did a fine job under the circumstances and the four male leads were very sexy the make up <UNK> and cuts however was on par with a <UNK> school talent show br br there wasn't enough meat to this story to have any impact on the gay <UNK> the film made no statement <UNK> time and is not engaging or worthy enough for thoughtful investment its fatal flaw is its amateurish approach that makes it ultimately impossible to take seriously
<START> charles <UNK> resume includes directing episodes on <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 'the <UNK> etc so he comes with all the <UNK> to make the tv film version of meg <UNK> novel surrender dorothy a success and for the most part he manages to keep this potentially sappy story about sudden death of a loved one and than manner in which the people in her life react <UNK> br br sara <UNK> <UNK> a beautiful <UNK> young woman is accompanying her best friends gay playwright adam tom everett scott <UNK> current squeeze shawn chris <UNK> and married couple <UNK> lauren german and peter josh hopkins with their <UNK> son to a house in the <UNK> for a summer vacation the group seems jolly until a trip to the local ice <UNK> by adam and sara results in an auto accident which kills sara meanwhile <UNK> mother natalie <UNK> diane keaton who has an active social life but <UNK> calls here daughter constantly with the mutual <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is playing it up elsewhere when she receives the phone call that sara is dead she immediately comes to the <UNK> where her overbearing personality and grief create <UNK> among <UNK> friends slowly but surely natalie <UNK> secrets about each of them <UNK> on talking about sara as though doing so would bring her to life <UNK> <UNK> for truth at any cost results in major changes among the group and it is only through the <UNK> love of the <UNK> sara that they all eventually come together br br diane keaton is at her best in these roles that walk the thread between drama and comedy and her presence holds the story together the screenplay has its moments for good lines but it also has a lot of filler that becomes a bit heavy and <UNK> making the actors obviously uncomfortable with the lines they are given yes this story has been told many times the impact of sudden death on the lives of those whose <UNK> is altered by <UNK> but the film moves along with a cast pace and has enough genuine entertainment to make it worth watching grady <UNK>
<START> oh those <UNK> italians it's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the <UNK> or knowledge of the in this case author of the novel of course this is not something that is typically italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it james m <UNK> <UNK> managed to keep this movie off american screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic br br the movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 american version but it's a great movie nevertheless this of course not in the least is due to the movie it's great strong story that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism it follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story with of course as a difference that it got set in an italian environment br br leave it up to the italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it these early <UNK> always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts the movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier br br nevertheless i don't really have much else negative to say about this movie it's simply a greatly made one based on some equally great and strong source material quite an impressive directorial debut for <UNK> visconti who continued to direct some many more great and memorable italian dramatic movies br br 8 10
<START> the film released at the start of 2000 <UNK> <UNK> both disasters so sad to start a millennium with such nonsense br br the film seems to suit 70's but looks like an unintentional comedy for 2000 br br <UNK> some classic gems from the film <UNK> <UNK> i don't understand to laugh at his role or cry reason he goes searching his mother in the village worst part is when he realises a secret of anil he keeps the secret in his stomach which becomes big and makes him look pregnant i remember in my childhood my teacher told me the same joke <UNK> as a child i laughed at it that time but here br br the whole film is a joke can't explain we have anil in a <UNK> role one older and younger and <UNK> playing the <UNK> wife and <UNK> the <UNK> we also have reject <UNK> while <UNK> playing the son of <UNK> <UNK> who both fight on who has the worst wig br br direction is outdated music is bad br br anil tries hard looks too old in the younger role and too young in the older role yet good effort <UNK> is adequate <UNK> too is okay <UNK> is bad <UNK> kapoor is terrible <UNK> <UNK> is as usual <UNK> is okay in a cameo
<START> i expect the same excitement as i spit on your grave but i was let down by just junk how can you even call this a movie its kinda of a mini porno it made my sick when the guy was made to eat his own business there is no story line to it at all it jumps to quickly from each murder if you like seeing a women naked or even <UNK> parts then there's spots in the movie for and there's even a masturbation spot in the movie which makes it a porno and not a movie at all i have seen some dumb movies in my time but this is number 1 i want be watching it again at all the actors even look bored during the movie to me so they probably were in need of money badly to make this movie
<START> jean luc <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is as close to unwatchable a film as you're likely to see from an <UNK> respected filmmaker bits of political theater mind numbingly boring and interminable are interspersed with the making of sympathy for the devil featuring the rolling stones in the studio br br the process of the <UNK> development from mick jagger playing a <UNK> on <UNK> guitar to the backing <UNK> being recorded towards the end is fascinating and it's worth renting this film just to see the bits with the stones almost half the movie is devoted to this so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch the stones put a song together br br when i had this on <UNK> i <UNK> attempted to watch it all but i don't see how anyone could get through it i finally gave up and just chapter <UNK> my way to the stones segments
<START> wes craven has been created a most successful killer thriller movies of all time after watching he's movies you will find your new fears people don't know which wes craven's thriller movie is the best because they all different br br in this movie lisa is <UNK> by fellow <UNK> he <UNK> her to kill and if she don't do this jack will kill her father lisa is in the huge mess because whatever she choose she will kill br br acting was unreal rachel mcadams and cillian murphy acted unbelievable good the emotions was in right choose idea and script of this movie is great too br br sometimes it reminds a scream but he definitely better than both screams sequels together br br and what can i say this is the best killer thriller movie in <UNK> century yet
<START> david mamet wrote the screenplay and made his directorial debut with house of games ' a character study <UNK> with psychological overtones in which a psychiatrist is <UNK> into the dark world of the confidence game margaret ford lindsay <UNK> has a successful practice and has written a best selling novel <UNK> ' still she is somewhat <UNK> with her own personal life there's an <UNK> she can neither define nor resolve and it <UNK> her vulnerability when a patient billy <UNK> steven <UNK> <UNK> to her during a session that he owes big money to some <UNK> and that they're going to kill him if he doesn't pay she decides to <UNK> on his behalf this takes her to the house of games ' a seedy little dive where she meets mike joe <UNK> a charismatic con man who wastes no time before <UNK> her into his world instead of the twenty five <UNK> that billy claimed he <UNK> mike shows her his book and it turns out to be eight hundred dollars and mike agrees to wipe the <UNK> clean if she'll agree to do him one simple favor which involves a card game he has going on in the back room in the middle of a big hand mike is going to leave the room for a few minutes while he is gone her job is to watch for the <UNK> of one of the other players by this time not only margaret but the audience as well is hooked the dialogue and <UNK> unique style and the precise <UNK> with which his actors deliver their lines is mesmerizing as mike leads margaret through his compelling surreal realm of existence and introduces her to the <UNK> of the con game we are swept right along with her from that first memorable encounter when he demonstrates what a <UNK> is and how it works to the lessons of the short con ' to the stunning climax of this film mamet keeps the con going with an urgency that is relentless and nothing is what it seems in the end margaret learns some hard lessons about life and human nature and about herself she changes and whether or not it's for the better is open to <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely riveting in this film he lends every nuance possible to a complex character who must be able to lead you willingly into the shadows and does <UNK> also turns in an outstanding performance here you feel the rigid up tight turmoil <UNK> beneath that calm self assured exterior and when her experiences with mike <UNK> the change in her she makes you feel how deeply it has <UNK> she makes you believe that she is capable of what she does and makes you understand it as well the dynamic supporting cast includes mike <UNK> joey <UNK> <UNK> dr <UNK> j t walsh the businessman ricky jay george and william h macy sergeant <UNK> house of <UNK> is the quintessential mamet he's written and directed a number of high caliber plays and films since and will no doubt grace us with more in the future but this film will be the one that <UNK> him and you can go to the <UNK> and look it up you'll find it under perfection ' this is one great movie you do not want to miss i rate this one 10 10
<START> the point of the vastly extended <UNK> phase of this star is born story seems to be to make ultimate success all the more sublime summer phoenix is very effective as an <UNK> young woman imprisoned within herself but never convincing as the stage actress of growing fame who both <UNK> and <UNK> from this <UNK> even in the lengthy scenes of <UNK> acting lessons we never see her carry out the <UNK> <UNK> after suffering through <UNK> largely self inflicted pain in excruciating detail we are given no <UNK> sense of her triumph br br the obsessive presence of the <UNK> pain seems to be meant as a guarantee of aesthetic <UNK> yet the causes of this pain poverty quasi <UNK> <UNK> sexual betrayal never come together in a coherent whole a <UNK> minute film with a simple plot should be able to <UNK> up its loose ends esther <UNK> is still not ready to go before an audience
<START> i think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made when i saw the trailer on tv i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of and it would be best to avoid it but i somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends i walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film the so called jokes in this film bring a cringe to the face they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls the baby looking weird and acting like a horny <UNK> and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies the film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull the characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped i never want to have to see this film again i'd rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of <UNK> ever again if anyone i see says they liked it i will physically punch them in the face
<START> i was p ed when i couldn't see this one when it was screening at the <UNK> film fest last year so when i saw that it was going to be on cable tonight i put it on remind as soon as i could so was it worth the wait well let's <UNK> a tad as i have yet to give you the plot sean <UNK> is a young man who doesn't know what his path in life is enter duke george <UNK> who introduces him to his boss ray danny baldwin one night ray totally <UNK> asks sean to off the guy that they had sean following around and it goes on from there which leads me back to the question <UNK> was it worth the wait yes and no the <UNK> was pretty good and george <UNK> stole the movie for me he just took the ball and ran with it but it's nowhere near as violent as i was led to believe and somewhere along the movies running time the ball is not only dropped but <UNK> and taken in the other direction i know where this point happened exactly but can't say without spoiling the film but needless to say it happened the ending doesn't save the film either poor stuart gordon nothing can be good like re animator or castle freak br br my grade c br br where i saw it showtime extreme br br eye candy <UNK> <UNK> shows her <UNK> <UNK> in one fantasy and then in the next more <UNK> <UNK> and it pans down and oh my god my eyes my eyes
<START> this is the first time i have commented on a film because i felt that if the right person read it they might wake up and do something about it over the last few months abc family began airing a new format of movies i have seen the last three and enjoyed them they were engaging and did the trick my wife likes these films i was looking forward to viewing see jane date the trailers looked and sounded great unfortunately this is one film where the book must be light years ahead of the effort displayed by the writers and music people involved with this project the year is 2003 the source all bad the score was as interesting as an elevator ride in a department store it was <UNK> and did not add any emotional content to the film at all it worked against it i work in the business of film and television i enjoy being entertained this is one instance where i kept thinking could it get any worse the script had lines from another decade and i know these women can act but you wouldn't know it from this movie to add to the overall experience the end left me shaking my head an advice to the executives at disney abc abc family and the producers under any circumstances please do not hire the composer or music <UNK> to do any of your future films they have lost their touch and they need to understand what the word contemporary present day and current means when describing a romantic comedy there is a world passing you by all in all a huge disappointment from folks at von <UNK> <UNK> and abc family
<START> although properly warned i actually sat down to watch this movie in part because i usually give every movie an even break and because i thought that a single movie couldn't be that bad i stand <UNK> not even george kennedy barry <UNK> or ben <UNK> could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of <UNK> only once during this humor <UNK> travesty of a spoof did i laugh namely during the simon says scene the other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny and some of them you actually see coming a mile away this movie just hasn't got what it takes to be a good parody like airplane i ii naked gun i ii iii or scary movie they all had a funny gags b good dialog and most important of all c unforgettable quotes men in white has got d none of the above to call this movie bad would be a gross understatement avoid this movie anyway you can consider yourselves warned
<START> this movie is a gem because it moves with soft but firm resolution br br i caution viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there it moves at a <UNK> <UNK> yet <UNK> pace it's not about explosions car chases or flying bullets you must be patient and instead note the details here it's <UNK> because that's what the main character is the viewer has to watch him and think as this story unfolds br br i will not give spoilers because that destroys the point of watching the plot is what you've read from the other <UNK> an average white collar guy seeking change and adventure signs on for a corporate spy job just go somewhere and secretly record and <UNK> inside data br br take it from there br br this movie starts at a surreal walk with a background <UNK> of corporate <UNK> that <UNK> itself with quintessential underlying suburban paranoia br br then it begins to <UNK> br br the acting on all parts is superb and yes some of the acts are caricature characters but they all fit and they entertain and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft soft key sinister theme all is not right at the beginning br br and at the end all is not what it seems br br get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one and turn up the sound this movie wants you to listen
<START> rich <UNK> joan <UNK> a woefully miscast bette davis is engaged to be married to stupid <UNK> allen <UNK> jack carson looking lost her father eugene palette is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot steve collins james cagney seriously they crash land in the desert and hate each other but sigh start falling in love br br this seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because cagney and davis are in it they were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas not comedy and this movie shows why the script is just horrible there's not one genuine laugh in the entire movie the running joke in this has cagney and davis falling <UNK> first in a <UNK> this is done three times only their considerable talents save them from being completely <UNK> as it is they both do their best with the lousy material cagney tries his best with his lines and davis <UNK> every line full force but it doesn't work carson has this what the hell look on his face throughout the entire movie probably because his characters emotions change in seconds only palette with his distinctive voice and over the top <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> a few smiles but all in all this was dull and <UNK> a real chore to sit through this gets two stars only for cagney and <UNK> acting and some beautiful cinematography but really it's not worth seeing cagney and davis hated this film in later years and you can see why
<START> <UNK> is in many ways a lost year in motion pictures just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre sound was coming in and while <UNK> great <UNK> at the box office was setting the art of film making back about five years as the film industry <UNK> with the new technology br br show people is one of the great silent era comedies the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious <UNK> guy who turns everyone against him learns his lesson and then <UNK> himself by winning the football game the <UNK> game etc this movie is also exhibit a for <UNK> that marion davies was no susan alexander kane she had excellent comic instincts and timing this film starts out as the beverly <UNK> like adventure of peggy pepper marion davies and her father general <UNK> <UNK> pepper fresh from the old south general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress while at the studio <UNK> the <UNK> run into billy <UNK> william haines a slapstick comedian he gets peggy an acting job she's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick but she <UNK> eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles soon the new found fame goes to her head and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man whom she doesn't really love unless fate somehow <UNK> br br one of the things mgm frequently does in its late silent era films and in its early sound era films is feature shots of how film making was done at mgm circa 1930 this film is one of those as we get charlie chaplin trying to get <UNK> <UNK> an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king <UNK> himself and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot peggy <UNK> and mentions that she doesn't care for her truly a delight from start to finish this is a silent that is definitely worth your while this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible
<START> this movie is a true masterpiece it really is it's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick full of fun laughter <UNK> and with a little drama to keep you on your <UNK> br br a true family film <UNK> bound tells the story of three brave pets who set out to cross the rocky mountains in an attempt to find their owners following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way one of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities the voice acting is that good shadow is a wonderful character old wise and brave and watching him trying to save sassy in the river was a very <UNK> moving moment chance who wouldn't love a dog like chance he's got to be the most mischievous and lovable <UNK> ever shown on the big screen and sassy is very witty for a cat she had me in <UNK> when she was mocking the keeper <UNK> kitty kitty kitty not on your life <UNK> ' br br there were also lots of well made emotional scenes such as sassy going over the <UNK> i was truly scared for her shadow falling in the <UNK> almost in tears and then the fantastic ending when all three pets return home including good old shadow br br a favourite for all time anyone who doesn't like this film must just not like animals rent it or buy it now and it'll leave you with happy memories that'll last a lifetime
<START> really bad shot on video film made by not one not two but three amateur video makers br br if you're going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood gore and nudity there is some blood provided by <UNK> cut off arm props bought at a halloween store there are lesbians and <UNK> but no nudity or sex the lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talking br br there seems to be no editing effects fades <UNK> etc once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenes br br terrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose <UNK> take up the majority of the end credits the werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the actors face they didn't even bother to apply brown makeup to their <UNK> arms or <UNK> br br i guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movie no reason at all to buy rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video
<START> okay i've always been a fan of batman i loved the animated series and even batman beyond i even read a batman comic now and then so as can be imagined i was a little excited when i heard about this series and then i was severely disappointed this series is nothing it doesn't even begin to compare with the original series it's like one long toy commercial no depth whatsoever and what the heck was with the joker who in my most humble opinion is the best batman villain of all time and they killed him i wish i could say his design was the worst part actually i wish i could say there was anything about this series that was remotely creative or interesting in short because believe me i could say so much more do not waste your time on this show or your money
<START> this could have been a rather entertaining film but instead it ranks with other <UNK> like <UNK> and rest in pieces at the bottom of the cinematic food chain had they played this flick tongue in cheek it could have been a very entertaining film like re animator or dead alive but juan <UNK> simon plays it tongue in cheek in spots but straight more often br br the premise of this film is a small community that is <UNK> by mutated slugs there is an abandoned toxic waste dump near a <UNK> line that <UNK> the slugs into aggressive meat eating monsters albeit monsters that move slowly and can be <UNK> under your boot health inspector michael <UNK> and two <UNK> are the only people that seem willing to fight the slugs while the sheriff and mayor think they are crazy the climax is a laugh riot unintentional at that which makes you scratch your head as to how stupid actors and screenwriter the scenario of destroying the slugs is br br story no new ground <UNK> here simon seems to play the gore elements tongue in cheek but the dialogue is straight had simon worked with a clever script one with plenty of one liners and eccentric characters this could have been a cult film br br violence you won't be letdown here we get plenty of exploding chest <UNK> scenes as well as a grand head explosion in the middle of a fine italian restaurant the blood and guts that many horror film <UNK> enjoy is in full swing here you also get corpses of people who have been picked clean by the slugs and plenty of slug <UNK> scenes br br acting wow michael garfield seems to know that this script is a stinker and he delivers his lines with a facial expression that suggests he knows how preposterous this film making <UNK> is kim terry as his wife does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold your face while you scream bit the teenagers were all horrible actors no exceptions man this film could have used bruce dern or jeffrey combs br br nudity two teens get naughty in bed before they get <UNK> in a poorly done scene by a <UNK> of slugs that <UNK> into the girl's bedroom both male and female nudity here
<START> now this is one of <UNK> best jack <UNK> single role in 1931 split into two for the band <UNK> radio team <UNK> <UNK> it boasts a great <UNK> cast who ham the play up for all they're worth especially <UNK> of course <UNK> were provided by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by herbert <UNK> and <UNK> by richard <UNK> br br the group of <UNK> passengers stranded at the lonely country station for the night find more than they <UNK> for ghostly trains <UNK> <UNK> hairy <UNK> rolls and arthur trying to entertain them all his <UNK> with everyone falls between side splitting and ghastly dull when the formula works it's very good but it sometimes gets very contrived and forced making the film seem more dated than it is but those damn <UNK> fifth <UNK> thank any god britain hasn't got any nowadays br br ultimately a nice harmless film to welcome back to the tv screen as an old friend but if you were expecting to be <UNK> out of your <UNK> you'll probably be very disappointed
<START> huge <UNK> and passionate summary of american cinema as seen through the eyes of martin <UNK> needless to say there is never a dull moment in all of its 4 hour running time many genres periods and directors are all examined discussed more from the perspective of <UNK> rather than contemporary director for anyone even remotely interested in american films or cinema in general a masterpiece and the best of the <UNK> century of cinema series br br
<START> i'm still trying to figure out if there was a point to this film br br for content that's supposed to be so <UNK> and <UNK> the things that <UNK> <UNK> to the students are awfully lame students seem to be easily <UNK> by vague anti <UNK> sentiments and snippets of words <UNK> <UNK> onto <UNK> rebel everybody br br i suppose it would have been too much to ask to have a teenage rebellion film where a school fire alarm doesn't get set off br br apparently a <UNK> fight up on the football <UNK> is a fight that consists of two people br br characters personalities seem to wildly <UNK> at random a football jock who <UNK> was fighting and who subsequently got a <UNK> on the face is all smiles and apologies the next day br br the fact that it doesn't come to any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could have been <UNK> into a half hour after school special if they had cut most of the attempted pseudo <UNK> soundtrack
<START> the only thing that surprises me more than the number of people who liked this movie is that it was directed by clint eastwood whose work i admire immensely the leads had absolutely no chemistry not for a second could i believe that there was anything deeper than lust between them the story just didn't ring true add to that stilted conversation tons of stereotypes and an incredibly slow plot that basically leads nowhere and you've got yourself a real stinker kay <UNK> nude scenes might be worthwhile for those seeking some <UNK> fare but otherwise this is a <UNK> waste of time my thoughts as i watched the movie was that <UNK> have been better titled cheesy
<START> this movie has some of the most awesome cars i've ever seen in a movie and definitely the <UNK> women but i would have to say it is still one of the worst movies i've ever seen br br here is the plot and if you read it with a little <UNK> you have the acting as well br br beginning bring in characters hot woman singing obvious lip sync music agent or producer comes in thinks that she is awesome asks her to race she turns down too many bad memories flash to war hero back from war has several fights and becomes movie hero with attitude that he is better than everyone drive off in fast exotic car brother races then dies hero to avenge death cut away to getting weapons from friend you have never seen this friend before or after but seems to really care about him are you sure you want to do this yes i mean are you really sure yes give me weapons are you really sure yes ok i guess i can't talk you out of it be careful man i love you br br now he goes to blow up his <UNK> house who owned the car his brother drove finds woman decides to rescue her she drives off and he doesn't finish killing his uncle now there will be a race to finish the movie oh yeah need to throw in one more scene with bad people coming in to beat up people that don't really matter but maybe it adds a little plot race is not even that exciting of course it ends with two cars racing and one that should win throws in a surprise ending br br ok i just saved you 7 00 you can send all of your money to me because i should have given you the same amount of enjoyment as this movie does don't get me wrong the cars are awesome and <UNK> is beautiful but it is truly an awful movie
<START> a cry in the dark br br a cry in the dark was a film that i anticipated would offer a phenomenal performance from meryl streep and a solid if <UNK> film this <UNK> came from the fact that aside from <UNK> best actress nomination the movie received little attention from major awards groups br br little did i <UNK> that a cry in the dark would be such a riveting drama well constructed on every level if you ask me this is an under <UNK> classic br br the film opens rather slowly letting the audience settle into the <UNK> at a relaxed pace and really notice that at the core they are an incredibly loving simple family fred <UNK> the director <UNK> random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a <UNK> sense of the <UNK> tragedy while also showing the <UNK> bliss with which lindy streep and michael sam <UNK> chamberlain care for their children br br while the famous line a <UNK> took my baby has become somewhat of a punchline these days the movie never even comes close to laughable the actual death of <UNK> is <UNK> captured it is subtle and realistic leaving the audience horrified and asking questions br br the majority of the film takes place in <UNK> and focuses on the <UNK> continuous fight to prove their innocence to the press and the court which suspects lindy of murder br br the fact that it is clear to us from the beginning that they are innocent makes the tense trials all the more gripping as an audience member i was fully invested in the <UNK> plight and was genuinely <UNK> and hurt and <UNK> when they were made to look so terrible by the media but at the same the media public opinion is understandable i loved the way the media was by no means made to be sympathetic but they always had valid reasons to hold their views br br the final line of the film is very profound and captures perfectly the central element that makes this film so much different from other courtroom dramas br br in terms of performances the only ones that really matter in this film are those of streep and <UNK> and they deliver in every way for me this ranks as one of if not 1 meryl <UNK> best performances for all her <UNK> of different accents which of course are very impressive in their own right streep never loses the central heart and soul of her characters i find this to be one of <UNK> more subtle performances and she hits it out of the park and <UNK> an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in jurassic park is a perfect <UNK> to <UNK> performance from what i've seen this is undoubtedly <UNK> finest work to date it's a shame he wasn't recognized by the academy with a leading actor nomination to match <UNK> b c the two of them play of each other brilliantly br br more emotionally gripping than most films and also incredibly suspenseful a cry in the dark far <UNK> my expectations i highly recommend that people who only know of the movie as the flick where meryl screams the <UNK> took my baby watch the film and see just how much more there is to a cry in the dark then that one line br br a
<START> as it is often the case the impressive and explosive trailers of asian films add up to nothing more than lackluster stories similar to unleashed which was great dog bite dog tells a story where men are raised as <UNK> savage dogs that carry out their <UNK> <UNK> the main characters an emotionally undeveloped amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer are far from the common heroes and villains we often see in fact by the end you lose track of who you're supposed to empathize with failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men  whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the <UNK> message he was trying to tell is up to you to decide br br although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and <UNK> by the half way point it <UNK> down to a <UNK> story of survival and revenge the suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly <UNK> music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling and in the end you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and <UNK> of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary br br on the plus side the transition in story from point a to point b was quite <UNK> compared to us movies  so those who aren't familiar with asian films and are tired of hollywood's predictability should check it out br br the white balance seemed off throughout most of the film it was like looking into a picture shot on <UNK> when it was supposed to be set on <UNK> maybe i'm the only one but it strained my eyes br br the movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you  an interesting build up gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was <UNK> to a low budget low speed chase scene and just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of shakespearean tragedy you realize that it's not an ending at all but rather a transition into a wacky country music montage about peace and <UNK> br br throw in some grisly from behind choke scenes a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into <UNK> and back again the other way <UNK> fascination with <UNK> <UNK> and a horrible music score that didn't match the film and you get the average bland asian thriller br br i just don't get why every fight scene was <UNK> with clips of roaring lions <UNK> thought they were supposed to <UNK> dogs ultimately in the end we are reminded about a true killer that still <UNK> amongst us  <UNK> br br 4 10

<START> this is the last of four <UNK> from france i've <UNK> for viewing during this christmas season the others in order of viewing were the uninspired the black <UNK> 1964 from the same director as this one but not nearly as good the surprisingly effective lady oscar 1979 which had <UNK> as a japanese manga and the splendid <UNK> <UNK> actually i had watched this one not too long ago on late night italian tv and recall not being especially <UNK> over by it so that i was genuinely surprised by how much i enjoyed it this time around also bearing in mind the <UNK> lack of enthusiasm shown towards the film here and elsewhere when it was first announced as an upcoming dvd release from <UNK> br br incidentally <UNK> la <UNK> has quite a bit in common with the <UNK> mentioned <UNK> not just cast and crew members producers georges <UNK> and alexandre <UNK> cinematographer christian <UNK> actor <UNK> <UNK> but plot wise as well  in fact the hero is a <UNK> soldier jean paul <UNK> <UNK> had also had a brief military spell who's loved by a fiery girl in this case gypsy gina <UNK> while he's himself obsessed by an impossible love here it's none other than the king's daughter as in the later film too <UNK> an <UNK> cast gerard <UNK> who ironically is so full of life here that one finds it hard to believe that he would be stricken down by cancer within 7 <UNK> time is <UNK> by two fun loving yet cowardly men one of them is actually his superior officer and the <UNK> own father and opposed by an <UNK> figure within his own ranks the <UNK> <UNK> with whom the hero eventually <UNK> in a <UNK> duel since he too has <UNK> designs on the gypsy girl for the record <UNK> will <UNK> <UNK> in her next film <UNK> <UNK> delightful romantic fantasy les <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> proved to be a big box office hit on its home ground and even <UNK> a surprising but well deserved best direction award at cannes over more renowned films like an american in paris 1951 detective story 1951 othello <UNK> d and <UNK> <UNK> in fact its popularity <UNK> its re release in a computer colored version presumably for the benefit of viewers who wouldn't touch a black and white product with a ten foot pole and the <UNK> dvd itself contains a <UNK> from this <UNK> being obviously a foreign language title there's also the dubious choice of an english dubbed soundtrack but even if these proved not especially painful to sit through considering when all is said and done there's simply no substitute for the original br br <UNK> la <UNK> a <UNK> given the hero by a young <UNK> page as the celebrated <UNK> de <UNK> contains about as much comedy as the expected action and romance while some may find this overwhelming i don't agree myself as i enjoyed the <UNK> satirical narration and on the whole this combination is comparable with <UNK> <UNK> equally <UNK> the adventures of gerard 1970 that said the <UNK> here are remarkably <UNK> for an essentially lighthearted enterprise particularly a <UNK> in the woods and the <UNK> at a convent and the film itself rather adult at times with numerous <UNK> to sexuality as well as coarse language adopted throughout when viewed back to back with vintage hollywood fare as i did now the climax then is quite ingenious the enemy forces who <UNK> are made to speak in <UNK> up <UNK> are <UNK> by our heroic trio alone much to the king's <UNK> who as portrayed by marcel <UNK>  best known for his role of leader of the <UNK> underworld in marcel <UNK> children of paradise 1945  is himself something of a <UNK> br br p s an italian tv channel has been threatening to screen christian <UNK> promising <UNK> for <UNK> 1964 for months now but despite programming it three times already with a <UNK> fourth one <UNK> for next week they have yet to show it even so i do have three more films of his in my <UNK> vhs pile equally <UNK> from late night italian tv <UNK> the three hour epic la <UNK> de <UNK> 1948 also starring gerard <UNK> the second twin 1967 and the legend of <UNK> king 1971 with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> at times this <UNK> the thing as my favourite horror film while carpenter's film is the more efficient and more entertaining flick kubrick's is more artistic more thought provoking and probably scarier it's one of the few films where i can look past its flaws and truly and wholly love it i try not to compare it to the book  which i've only read once a number of years ago and which scared me to death  because the two don't have a lot in common besides the story and characters obviously it's almost as if kubrick was <UNK> on people's love of the novel in order to make his film more frightening and it that way it's certainly one of the most interesting book adaptations ever made as well as one of the greatest horror films br br what makes the film so terrifying is not the jump scares not the blood and gore not the various ghosts that pop up from time to time it's the destruction of jack <UNK> some people have complained about the casting of nicholson in this role saying that it's too obvious that he's going to go crazy in the film given his past roles and his appearance i disagree we know he's going to go crazy  since most of us have read the book  and jack's appearance only <UNK> this notion but it's the way he acts at the beginning that makes us truly scared he's calm quiet patient he <UNK> in inane small talk with the hotel <UNK> and even with his own family and with a wife and son as irritating as his it's a small wonder that he manages to do so but once he gets to the overlook he changes he becomes <UNK> angry on edge the scene that always shocks me is when wendy <UNK> him <UNK> and he utterly loses it telling her to leave him the f alone this is the first f bomb dropped in the film and it's a shock to the system from then on all <UNK> are off br br another thing i love is the multiple interpretations present in the film we're never really sure if what we're seeing is actually happening many critics have noted that whenever jack talks to a ghost there's a mirror present showing that he may as well be talking to himself but what of the other characters wendy never sees anything until the film's climax until she is given a tour of the <UNK> many ghostly inhabitants but she is well aware that something is wrong while danny <UNK> with the place almost immediately his psychic powers are not in question  how else would <UNK> know to come to the hotel  but does he ever see any of the ghosts that his parents witness it's easy to claim that jack merely loses it being trapped in a hotel with his family and wendy later does as well  seeing your husband attempt to kill you with an axe will do that  but what of danny it appears that his body is taken over by tony but how do we know for sure none of these characters are reliable witnesses <UNK> probably would be and he warns of the dangers in <UNK> but he's killed as soon as he arrives at the overlook a scare kubrick achieves by playing on the <UNK> of fans of the novel and that final shot has there ever been a more enigmatic ending in cinema has jack really been there before or was his body merely <UNK> into the hotel when talking about the acting in this film any discussion begins and ends with jack nicholson shelley duvall gives one of the most annoying performances in cinematic history  probably on purpose to give jack's character more of a reason to snap  and danny lloyd is no better but jack is a <UNK> part method part <UNK> he's simultaneously terrifying and appealing for better or for worse he's the character with whom we identify with not the annoying kid or <UNK> wife we all want to have a hotel to ourselves for a season be able to do whatever we want who cares if it's haunted of course the technical aspects are terrific kubrick's long takes strange angles and bizarre imagery all contribute to the horror the use of colour mirrors long <UNK> and every other <UNK> only <UNK> this and don't even get me started on that score i don't know if the film would be half as scary without that haunting electronic tune its <UNK> perfectly reflects the hotel the mood and the entire film itself br br i know king doesn't like this film but king's <UNK> on cinema is nothing to <UNK> about as great of a novel writer he may be his screenplays are terrible and his attempt at directing is better left <UNK> this is not a very faithful book adaptation but it doesn't need to be and it really shouldn't part of the horror of the film is that the viewer doesn't have the book to fall back on there's no <UNK> source material kubrick masterfully <UNK> the narrative to <UNK> the audience even more if only for that this is one of the most innovative films in any genre and it's got everything else on top of that
<START> i felt this movie started out well the acting was spot on and i felt for all the characters situation even though the true family unit was not completely revealed we never got enough info on the father to truly feel his pain for his whole involvement or the build up for his <UNK> with tobe i mean in one scene you see him <UNK> her for <UNK> and in another scene he just about takes her head off another problem with the movie was it just <UNK> and lost all focus by the end and i was begging for it to just be over with any movie with such a long drawn out and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or above just for the acting we are looking at the over all quality of the movie experience in the case of this movie the end is so bad i seriously <UNK> just walking out of the theater this movie pulled me in then just spit me out
<START> freddy's dead the final nightmare the sixth installment of the nightmare on elm street series and once again another bad sequel i think this is tied up with the last sequel of the dream child i was lucky enough to get the nightmare on elm street series box dvd set for my birthday so i got to see all the sequels may i say that i'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels at least the past two it just seems like freddy lost his edge it's almost like the writers were trying to give freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of <UNK> the story this was a sequel that wasn't needed sorry to robert englund but this was very much below what freddy krueger represents br br freddy is back but he's got something we don't know about a daughter maggie she's not aware that he is her father but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help she has to do her best to resist his powers but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father ironic isn't it but freddy isn't giving up without <UNK> her into his ways br br freddy's dead the final nightmare is also presented in 3 d radical huh note the sarcasm this is one of the worst sequels it's tied up with the fifth sequel of the nightmare on elm street series i'd rather watch the second nightmare on elm street to be honest this just had bad acting stupid editing and just over all a bad idea for a story i didn't like the concept of it and it just ruined the whole idea of who freddy krueger really is the death master of nightmares not father knows best br br 2 10
<START> this movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together well there's nothing wrong with that except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together 90 percent of the cast are white males about same age it's almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves the movie has no plot it simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath there are some funny scenes and comedic bits but they don't redeem the flat <UNK> br br the graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do and not done very well at that anything that can't be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation br br i went to see this film after seeing the trailer which makes it look like a <UNK> piece well the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get <UNK> rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane inane comedy it works at times but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over it's more like a string of <UNK> night live skits than a movie it's a hit you over the head with it kind of comedy i can see where the story idea is intriguing but in this film post apocalyptic america is much like <UNK> england in fact <UNK> says the story ideas came from that era he plans to make a part 2 i guess he thinks he's <UNK> or maybe doing a parody thing br br at the opening in la <UNK> mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2 he was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one to which he <UNK> well <UNK> sure
<START> where do they get the money to make films like this i mean there's nothing redeeming about this film none of the actors are known the writing is terrible the photography is <UNK> the story wanders between being a bad version of <UNK> man and a <UNK> western and the acting is unbelievable for someone who watches all kinds of film good and bad i must admit that this film is about the worst i've seen since attack of the eye people back in the 50's i don't really like to trash the effort of people trying to create some entertainment or heaven <UNK> art but this film would seem to appeal to no one the story <UNK> on a mystical <UNK> of a person who's a bad version of the <UNK> soul eater although he functions more like a male <UNK> without the sexual overtones the bad guys have to team up with the good guys in a town where they are unable to escape from take it from there as that alas is the best part my advice is that unless you are into bad mythology amateurish writing unconvincing acting and tedious settings you will best be served by leaving this one on the shelf when you're out renting videos
<START> this show is awesome i thought that the two episodes where paul died were so sad i actually cried but the other shows were awesome <UNK> was my favorite character because she was in the dark side i also thought that bridget was funny because she was all <UNK> i also thought that guy who played kyle was really really cute i loved it when <UNK> made sarcastic remarks about everything the guy who played <UNK> was cute and paul played by john ritter was really funny this whole entire tv show is funny and i wish they still showed it on tv when they did show it on tv though i watched it every single time it was on the next time it shows i will watch it over and over again
<START> very bad film very very very bad film it's a <UNK> but it <UNK> is not worth hunting down this italian jaws rip off makes little sense most of the time and no sense the rest the alligator is not at all convincing and many of the sub plots go nowhere if it's at the local video store you may want to watch it if you're a fan of monster movies but it's not worth hunting down
<START> i was surprised when i saw this film i'd heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel how disappointed i was br br how any true jane austen fan can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes the <UNK> have decided to stick in bits of ridiculous humour which are embarrassing at the best of times but also ruin the feel of the period as for the cast gwyneth paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine but then any <UNK> american star would be questionable in the role toni collette is miscast and poor ewan <UNK> is made to look laughable br br i really could not say a good thing about this film i seem to be among the very few who don't rate it but if you want my advice see instead the tv production starring kate beckinsale believe me that is far <UNK> to this superficial trash
<START> an <UNK> second installment that manages to be just as good as the first br br once again the casting is just wonderful i like how the first and second episode have nothing in common except for the wit and <UNK> br br the second episode is just very funny very silly and very enjoyable it is the very first christmas episode about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as santa after having killed her own husband just like the first episode <UNK> br br the most humorous scene is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call first <UNK> her fear until it becomes real
<START> an very good storyline good thrill to it but the 10 last seconds destroyed the whole movie what happened extremely well made and an good story destroyed in the last seconds sorry to say but a 1 in vote thats what it it deserve i would think that chris <UNK> could come up with a better end but maybe next time all this meaningless blood gore for nothing the end would lift the story to close to a 10 but it didn't the end destroyed the whole story i think most people aren't lame and when they goes a movie <UNK> want a good end even if it is intricate but the only lame here is the end sorry
<START> this should not have been listed as a <UNK> because in my opinion it does not resemble any of the other <UNK> ever made this should have been listed as a movie starring peter falk and not playing the <UNK> of <UNK> because it does not do justice at all to our great lieutenant <UNK>
<START> the planning episodes were a bit dull but when they reached the desert it was quite fun to watch the reason why i call it the most realistic reality show is because much to my surprise <UNK> fell out of the race relatively early when his hands were sore i expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix but instead he actually quit the race the most anxious moment of the show must've been when max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food the ending was great and i was very happy to see at least one of the team make it overall not as great as the long way round but definitely an interesting watch as one gets a <UNK> into the most challenging race in the world
<START> father and son communicate very little in fact they speak different languages but when the son drives his father 3000 miles for his <UNK> to <UNK> the conversations finally take place they are difficult and growth is necessary on both parts br br this movie takes us into the hearts of these two <UNK> and it is indeed a grand voyage for the audience as well as the two principals the imagery throughout is impressive especially the final scenes in <UNK> it <UNK> for me once again how much different the world can be but also at the same time how similar the same was true for the father and son in this film br br see this movie tell your friends to see it you'll be glad you did
<START> spoilers br br i saw the original on tv sometime ago and remembered this production as less gripping than most <UNK> costume drama i <UNK> on dvd this week and still have the same impression of it it's a good story at first but <UNK> when the heroine becomes oh so terribly brave and noble and returns to her utterly vile husband when he's ill and i got so totally irritated with her <UNK> i suppose this was the right thing to do when the story was written as well as <UNK> plenty of angst and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband as marriage made her no more than his possession let alone to carry on <UNK> with a lover as i expect a lot of the modern audience would have liked to see but it's hard to take the <UNK> nowadays and especially when this heroine had a strong brave admirer ready to defend her against anyone and everyone so re the story as in the film i'm <UNK> it's well done as per the novel but somewhat irritating as per today's kind of life br br <UNK> hero gilbert was certainly a saint to put up with his <UNK> <UNK> and often <UNK> behaviour and <UNK> self denial and to be so consistently supportive so i felt it a great shame that when helen was at long last free to be with him the script didn't allow him a bit more than about one minute to fall on each other for a quick hug before the titles came up this was completely ridiculous when we'd been waiting all this time through all that dripping sentiment over the <UNK> husband for a decent bit of dialogue and a good embrace between hero and heroine instead the ending was as though the film makers had run out of time or <UNK> or just couldn't be bothered here you are one minute do what you can in that then cut as the director wants to go home now i was left feeling totally <UNK> br br however very high <UNK> to the acting of toby <UNK> a perfect and very handsome hero and rupert graves a superbly nasty and self <UNK> villain tara fitzgerald was satisfactory within the confines of the script that forced her to be a depressing and rather <UNK> victim so much of the time br br that said i love these classic dramas and virtually all of them are a sight better than much of the modern drama on tv these days so 7 stars because in spite of the <UNK> it's still a good watch
<START> i saw this film at the toronto film festival where it received a standing <UNK> this film tells a story that to my knowledge has never been told before namely about the rosenstrasse a street in berlin <UNK> of german <UNK> women who were married to jews at the end of the second world war as such it is a unique story and what's more is the only film about the holocaust that i have ever seen that shows that there were good germans the helping family in anne frank for instance was dutch who did not support the nazis and in fact had the <UNK> to stand up against their own country's <UNK> and brutality during the nazi regime at the risk of their very lives the acting is great across the board the framing story in new york interesting and intricate the direction from von <UNK> masterful in every scene and the production values including the gorgeous cinematography outstanding of course the family in new york could be speaking german many immigrants in this country choose to speak in their native tongue with their family a common <UNK> so that criticism is <UNK> to say more would spoil the experience the film is long but i did not look at my watch once i am hoping this film gets some distribution is north america for not only is this film a masterpiece but it can actually help <UNK> any <UNK> people have towards the germans because of their support of hitler if this film is playing in your area i urge you to see it you will be glad you did
<START> perhaps you won't care for the social commentary or the film makers point of view i myself am <UNK> at the <UNK> angle <UNK> seemed to promote  when clearly the actions taken in the movie promote certain significance the ending confused me however there's absolutely no denying the manner in which the story is presented the magnificent symbolism throughout the <UNK> character <UNK> visuals dialogue  is absolute <UNK> i've watched the movie dozens of times and i still marvel at its perfection there's not a moment action cut or line that doesn't have everything to do with the theme realistic human performances from all the actors scene to scene it's woven fantastically br br i have a pretty level <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> never went off during this film if you're a <UNK> rather than a casual viewer  this movie delivers <UNK> absolutely mesmerizing do you have to agree with the message to appreciate the display who cares if it made you warm and fuzzy or not was it interesting br br personally the movie affected me  significantly in my top 5 br br note the front page reviewer clearly speaks from a flawed african american perception what he may have failed to recognize is there was a hand  shake not a hand out the <UNK> dead white man' simply saw a man to respect and admire and he did something about it the fact he was black had little if anything to do with it color is simply used to draw the parallel and the <UNK> it's no accident the opening sequence shifts from black and white to color either if you view the blacks in this movie as <UNK>  you may want to <UNK> your angst you may be seeing only black and white yourself eh just a thought
<START> alone in the dark is one bad movie and tied with <UNK> <UNK> for worst movie of the year i wish that was all i had to say but of course the imdb <UNK> a word count and all that br br i'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie a low budget dreck like red zone cuba monster a go go and <UNK> or a huge budget disgrace like <UNK> <UNK> or this <UNK> you see movies like monster a go go and <UNK> happen because the director hasn't a clue movies like this happen because the director is a stupid money grabbing idiot who simply doesn't care about his audience br br it's more shocking when you consider that uwe boll the mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real garbage under his belt has created something that only happens once in a blue moon the really terribly bad horror film everything about it is a mess cheesy cgi bad plot insane random camera cuts and appalling soundtrack br br alone in the dark is a dreadful movie that should be watched by absolutely nobody woo <UNK> review over give me a bud roll on 2006 and may i never speak of this again br br don't watch this film
<START> if you go see this movie you'll be holding a grudge against the movie theatre the director the producer the actors and the person that told you to go see it shame on you sarah michelle <UNK> for putting your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie it may have been more scary if the japanese actors would have just spoken in japanese instead of attempting to <UNK> in english i wanted to boo when the movie ended a true disappointment after all of the hype on tv and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker sarah michelle really didn't have to act at all to make this movie she just <UNK> her <UNK> skills don't waste your time or money on this film
<START> pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving <UNK> this is a horrible film in every way imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher comedy video they would receive a d for this college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school since this monstrosity was made by professionals i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema <UNK> i enjoy watching bad movies like plan 9 from outer space but this thing doesn't even fall into that category the script acting sound and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood <UNK> or 1970's horror films after viewing this you get the feeling you've wasted an hour and a half of your life
<START> this movie was a real torture fest to sit through its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self evidently a <UNK> <UNK> that it barely needs to convince the audience of it when it does <UNK> to putting in its argument it has the participants <UNK> deliver barely <UNK> facts all that's missing is someone crying when is someone going to think of the children while watching this movie i kept thinking <UNK> you hear that or that can't possibly be true yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources and bless 'em the <UNK> <UNK> in the movie came across more like <UNK> than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power to be fair that might be the fault of the film makers but equally fairly it's a condition shared by the movie's rock stars br br as for the performers now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music i've enjoyed and i'm sure a few of them really did believe in this cause but they all come across as <UNK> old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over now that the 60s have passed them by particularly embarrassing are graham <UNK> and james taylor <UNK> seems to be trying too hard he looks like he can't possibly believe the things he's being told not that i blame him but desperate to feel noticed and included james taylor performs what has to be the <UNK> protest <UNK> ever stand and fight in the most <UNK> cheerful way you can imagine in fact most of the performances are pretty bland when they're not being <UNK> nobody seems worked up by this event as if it really doesn't mean much to them at all it's worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be john hall of the band orleans and responsible for some of the <UNK> <UNK> pop of the 70s remember if you dare dance with me and still the one it's worth noting because that's symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music the cause is supposedly life or death but everybody <UNK> through their numbers like they're playing the <UNK> except maybe <UNK> scott <UNK> his protest number we almost lost detroit is on topic at least but delivered with all the <UNK> of a high <UNK> impressed with how <UNK> he's being br br only bruce <UNK> performance raises a pulse i've never been a big fan of the boss but he absolutely <UNK> no question part of me thinks he was taped <UNK> at another event and edited into this movie to give wake the audience compared to the general <UNK> and air of self satisfaction here it's no wonder bruce was <UNK> as the <UNK> of <UNK> br br but even his performance is <UNK> by the lifeless concert shooting i don't expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a '70s film but the shots are unnecessarily static broken up only by split second <UNK> to a back up <UNK> <UNK> now some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with and maybe the film makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage but all you have to do is watch <UNK> never sleeps or the last <UNK> to see a movie like this done with more skill and with more exciting musicians br br so really there's only two things to watch this movie for <UNK> stellar performance and as a sad <UNK> about a counter culture in decline
<START> <UNK> last <UNK> of 2006 proved to be a hit with the fans but for one reason only the ladder match which was only <UNK> to be paul london and brian <UNK> against william regal and dave taylor but with the recent crap <UNK> being december to <UNK> wwe knew that it had to do something to get the fans talking again this proved useful when it introduced <UNK> and the hardy <UNK> to the mix and announced that the match was going to be a ladder match br br the match was brutal and one of the best ladder matches i have ever seen but joey <UNK> face was a total mess johnny <UNK> didn't even check on his partner they just carried on like nothing happened and taylor and regal did nothing during the match except hit people with a few ladder shots in the end london and <UNK> <UNK> the titles br br elsewhere on the show kane defeated <UNK> in a decent <UNK> match when he set <UNK> stupid costume on fire chris benoit <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a decent match gregory <UNK> defeated jimmy wang <UNK> to retain the wwe <UNK> title in a solid effort br br but the main event was a total mess king booker teamed with <UNK> to take on john cena and <UNK> the action was shoddy and no one cared who <UNK> picked for his partner br br overall results kane defeated <UNK> in an <UNK> match br br paul london and brian <UNK> <UNK> the wwe tag team titles against the hardy <UNK> <UNK> and david taylor and william regal in a ladder match br br chris benoit defeated <UNK> <UNK> to retain the us title in a decent match br br gregory <UNK> defeated jimmy wang <UNK> to retain the <UNK> championship br br the boogeyman beat the <UNK> in a terrible match br br the undertaker defeated mr kennedy in a last ride match br br john cena and <UNK> defeated king booker and <UNK> in an abysmal match br br overall grade b
<START> the original movie man from snowy river is one of the best i've seen nearly perfect a lady and the tramp storyline in two senses rich girl poor boy and ability vs <UNK> the sequel however is not only a shameless attempt to capitalize on the good name of the original but also a ridiculous overblown <UNK> mess best <UNK> as rambo meets the black <UNK> without the charm of the black <UNK> the young hero comes back from a 3 year absence and suddenly he's superman on <UNK> in the original good film he was real and believable but sadly reduced to a caricature in the sequel i've hardly been as disappointed in a movie and at times this thing made me quite angry they missed hardly a cliché <UNK> audience manipulation do studio heads think that all you have to do with a horse loving audience is put pretty horses in front of them to make them happy a mess of a movie
<START> at first i was <UNK> out that a tv show's main character could bring the dead back to life but then i thought i'd give it a shot guess what i love pushing daisies and look forward to <UNK> nights just to watch it then for the next week i watch it a few more times on my <UNK> the colorful characters witty banter fast paced dialogue and new unique situations draws me in and <UNK> from beginning to end ned and chuck <UNK> relationship is interesting to watch as they work their romance around the fact that they cannot have physical contact even detective <UNK> <UNK> character has continued to grow in complexity and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she cracks me up the <UNK> voice is fun to listen to and the cinematography gives me the impression that i am watching a movie instead of a tv show i have recommended my family and friends to turn on pushing daisies and they are hooked too the show is well worth waiting a week for a new episode and if you have not seen p d i highly recommend watching it
<START> winter kills is a terrible incoherent and very disappointing conspiracy comedy thriller from little known director william <UNK> while watching the film i honestly felt as if i was the emperor in the classic fable the <UNK> new clothes the film made me feel like a fool because i couldn't make head nor tail of the <UNK> plot and the nonsensical characters but i felt kind of embarrassed to admit to myself that the film was <UNK> my brain up in <UNK> so i stuck with it to the end hoping that the whole <UNK> mess would <UNK> itself then i realised the film is supposed to be <UNK> nonsensical and illogical because that's the whole point this is a satirical look at conspiracy theories and <UNK> with the <UNK> up of the plot used as a metaphor for the <UNK> up of truths half truths and lies that define any conspiracy even when i got that the joke was on me i still felt winter kills to be a pretty awful movie br br young nick <UNK> jeff bridges is the younger brother of a former united states president who was <UNK> in philadelphia nick is present when a dying man claims that he shot the president and gives detailed information about where he <UNK> the gun nick follows the clues but every step of the way the people helping him seem to die in mysterious circumstances also his father <UNK> <UNK> john huston a vulgar and <UNK> wealthy businessman keeps <UNK> with <UNK> investigation the deeper he <UNK> into the assassination the more nick realises that he is <UNK> into a web of complex lies and red herrings where nothing is as it seems and no one can be trusted br br the film is an utter nightmare to follow and in many ways is not worth trying to follow for the <UNK> mentioned reason that it deliberately <UNK> itself up the cast is packed with extraordinary talent but most of them are wasted <UNK> <UNK> has one of the <UNK> and most pointless cameo roles in cinematic history elizabeth taylor appears uncredited and has not a single line of dialogue richard <UNK> is given what seems to be an interesting role but his character goes nowhere john huston has the best role as the powerful <UNK> and provides us with the film's few enjoyable moments with his <UNK> delivery anthony <UNK> also gets a creepy role and handles it well though his screen time is far too short to do complete justice to the character some nudity and sex scenes are tossed in for no real reason and while they're quite graphic and might appeal to <UNK> they really belong in another film the film's semi comic climax is <UNK> and disappointing yet <UNK> memorable in its weird little way there's obviously a cult audience out there somewhere for winter kills but i won't be counting myself among its number
<START> i remember i saw this cartoon when i was 6 or 7 my grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall i remember that it really sucked the plot had no sense i hated the fox that became <UNK> friend he was so stupid casper cried his head off if he couldn't find a friend so what get over it the only good part and i don't want to sound mean spirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end i laughed my head off in <UNK> because this cartoon sucked so much the bad news is the fox <UNK> and becomes a ghost i wish he had stayed dead i think i even gave the video of this to somebody because i hated it no wonder they were offering it for free at the mall if you have a child don't let them watch this they will probably agree with me that it sucks
<START> i do get irritated with modern adaptations of shakespeare when the director can't make his mind up whether to use the original or to update it if it's using the original words in an updated setting that's particularly <UNK> if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work ok in period styles <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> night set late victorian very effectively it could work with the 30's setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of shakespeare's text unfortunately it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show br br another problem is branagh himself i agree he's far too old to play one of the students but more important he's such an experienced shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student his strength of acting shows all the time of course he should have played the king no problem in having a mature student king surrounded by younger students instead we had a pleasant but <UNK> actor for the king thus an <UNK> so called king with no <UNK> attributes br br the amount of song and dance which i found tedious in spite of the nice songs and pleasant enough dancing unfortunately meant the great shakespearean dialogue had to be cut down drastically so the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild <UNK> and i got very bored including with the comic turns and was glad when it ended branagh has not done shakespeare justice in this production br br <UNK> however to richard <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> absolutely splendid as the older couple
<START> this is to the zatoichi movies as the star trek movies were to star trek except that in this case every one of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this big shiny re do and also better made if substance is more important than surface had i never seen them i would have thought this good looking but empty since i had i thought its style inappropriate and its content <UNK> the idea of <UNK> the character in a bigger <UNK> production must have sounded good but there was no point in it other than the hope of making money it's just a show which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character's world and wholly fails to take the character anywhere he hasn't been already also the actor wasn't at his best i'd been hoping to see <UNK> at a late stage of life in a story that would see him out <UNK> and draw some conclusion from his experience overall this just <UNK> bits and pieces from the other movies seasoned with more sex and <UNK> violence not the same experience at all
<START> i thought this movie was really really great helena did an amazing job in it i thought she played her character very well she's an awesome actress br br the movie was also really funny too the jokes were great i <UNK> stop laughing br br i think everyone should see it br br
<START> being a filmmaker myself and <UNK> a somewhat dark and <UNK> sense of humour i thought i was in for a treat when i took home my <UNK> not that the dvd cover gives anything away instead <UNK> for the ambiguous quote from <UNK> director chris morris a short film including scenes i should have known better really and avoided this insipid and often offensive piece of <UNK> br br the scene in the church is repulsive to watch especially since we are all too familiar with <UNK> <UNK> attitude towards <UNK> from his notorious tv series <UNK> eye and serves no purpose other than to shock how this film is <UNK> a comedy i will never understand br br the <UNK> commentary sounds like a novel idea in principle having been a runner myself it's often an interesting and <UNK> perspective on the filmmaking process however this is sadly not the case here instead we are treated to some public <UNK> <UNK> about dogs on film before <UNK> that there are no really great movies starring dogs this is all very interesting but not worth a single frame of celluloid br br to say that this film goes nowhere would be an understatement it relies far too heavily upon its <UNK> style at the expense of plot character and dialogue leaving the viewer strangely <UNK> and <UNK> its over <UNK> message that man should take responsibility for his actions is both <UNK> obvious and poorly illustrated br br the film does have its moments of pseudo <UNK> <UNK> but ultimately it fails to convince to entertain to <UNK> and just ends up being irritating if you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking i strongly recommend <UNK> <UNK> it's a wonderful life by peter <UNK>
<START> it's cheesy it's creepy it's gross but that's what makes it so much fun it's got over the top melodramatic moments that are just plain laughable this movie is great to make fun of rent it for a good laugh br br the film centers around three women <UNK> during a time way before <UNK> they go to a small town to cover a festival but they can't get a room to stay the night and that's when they meet ernest <UNK> he's creepy in a psycho kind of way and he offers to let them stay at his home but he doesn't tell them the truth about who lives there br br stephen <UNK> performance is so amazing as the unseen that he really carries this film most of the movie is kind of dull although finding out the truth of <UNK> family is kind of interesting br br just seeing this cast in these scenes makes it worth a look barbara bach and doug <UNK> make nice eye candy br br i consider the movie an old gem hard to find and worth a look
<START> i really enjoyed this film because i have a tremendous interest in american history the <UNK> years and the civil war in particular i purchased it recently from a rack of previously viewed videos on sale at the supermarket and i was very glad to add this one to my history video collection though not of the caliber of civil war films such as glory or <UNK> provides a lot of history on the pre civil war <UNK> among <UNK> at west point br br maybe it's the gray uniforms the youth or the military discipline but i am fascinated by the story of the <UNK> of <UNK> from around <UNK> to the brink of the war i imagine what it must have been like to sit in a <UNK> with other young men learning how to make war then later putting the lessons to use against your own classmates br br actually there were two classes <UNK> in <UNK> one class in may the other in june the movie makes no real mention of this except to mention henry a <UNK> first graduate of the may class and george <UNK> last <UNK> of the june class the reason for the two classes was not so much about the war but it was the result of switching back to a four year course of study after a few years of <UNK> with a five year course i think the first class had attended five years the other for four as the movie portrays <UNK> were like brothers and often had <UNK> for each other george <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cushing james beauty stuart for j e b stuart class of <UNK> etc br br i say this film is santa <UNK> trail as it should have been because that 1940 film while enjoyable really <UNK> history <UNK> from several different classes are all <UNK> together <UNK> stuart and george <UNK> are portrayed as the best of friends and are side by side in stopping john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at <UNK> ferry in fact stuart and <UNK> were never friends but enemies during the war they faced each other for the first time i think at <UNK> in <UNK> stuart was at the <UNK> ferry raid but <UNK> was still a <UNK> at the point when it took place br br <UNK> <UNK> plays a role in class of <UNK> though his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> o'neill and <UNK> <UNK> are fictional i believe they are respectively based on <UNK> henry <UNK> and john <UNK> two people you can look up br br anyway i truly enjoy this film or any film which provides a window into mid 19th century america

<START> well at least my theater group did lol so of course i remember watching grease since i was a little girl while it was never my favorite musical or story it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it's still a lot of fun to watch i heard horrible things about grease 2 and that's why i decided to never watch it but my boyfriend said that it really wasn't all that bad and my friend agreed so i decided to give it a shot but i called them up and just laughed first off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn't really clever not to mention they just used the same characters but with different names and actors tell me how did the pink ladies and t birds continue years on after the former gangs left not to mention the creator face <UNK> cycle enemy gee what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these t birds were just stupid and ridiculous br br another year at <UNK> and the music and dancing hasn't stopped but when a new student who is <UNK> cousin comes into the scene he is love struck by a pink lady stephanie but she must stick to the code where only pink ladies must stick with the t birds so the new student decides to train as a t bird to win her heart so he dresses up as a rebel <UNK> cycle <UNK> who can ride well and defeat the evil <UNK> from easily kicking the t <UNK> <UNK> but will he tell stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own well find out for yourself br br grease 2 is like a silly tv show of some sort that didn't work the gang didn't click as well as the first grease did not to mention <UNK> coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable because i thought that she <UNK> from <UNK> but apparently she didn't the songs were not really that catchy i'm glad that michelle was able to <UNK> back so fast but that's probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel i wouldn't really recommend this film other than if you are curious but i warned you this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical br br 2 10
<START> mesmerizing breathtaking and horrifying this <UNK> beautiful film is the apocalypse now without fiction slow in pace quiet in mood it gives good glimpses of the <UNK> <UNK> of earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom br br there is no doubt in my mind the nature is plagued and we are the disease greed the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress has turned us into something like cancer on its way to <UNK> the host and die with it br br <UNK> landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience at least i'll never regard my <UNK> and iron the same way again
<START> a wonderful movie anyone growing up in an italian family will definitely see themselves in these characters a good family movie with sadness humor and very good acting from all you will enjoy this movie we need more like it
<START> when i heard the plot for this movie i simply had to see it i mean whole cities being wiped out by killer tomatoes sadly the title is about as funny as it gets br br led by detective dick mason a special team of military and scientists including greg <UNK> who never takes his <UNK> outfit off and lt <UNK> who is never <UNK> without his <UNK> <UNK> behind <UNK> of the killer <UNK> is a parody of b movies in particular japanese horror of the 1950's the film begins with a standard sized <UNK> being discovered by a women <UNK> up in her kitchen before we find ourselves in a middle of a crime scene as the <UNK> has supposedly murdered this lady and let me tell you it doesn't get any <UNK> as the film progresses to be fair there are a couple of funny moments for instance anytime the japanese scientist dr <UNK> speaks his voice is dubbed over in an american accent or when disguise expert sam smith <UNK> the tomatoes <UNK> can somebody please pass the <UNK> ' equally this film was probably a lot funnier in 1978 with the whole so bad its good concept unfortunately for <UNK> of the killer <UNK> spoof films such as the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> series have been released and done this kind of comedy a lot better since br br the acting is atrocious there is zero continuity in the editing and it just feels genuinely slow and lacking energy for a parody film to work you need a lot of things happening at once one gag after the over the singing in the film seems pointless and the <UNK> for the furniture store that flash across the screen are damn right bizarre even for this film ultimately however you can see why this film is a cult one i can't see many people being indifferent to it unfortunately terrible would be the way i would sum this up
<START> i enjoyed this film it was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of peter <UNK> br br a number of people have disliked the film but it has to be seen in context of the origin story that it is the film uses flashback to show the young modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman that she became before the network before willie <UNK> br br the pace is a <UNK> slow and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes however this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version br br if you like modesty blaise you will enjoy it even with its faults if you just want an action flick with car chases forget it br br it has the feeling of being the first of a franchise but as i have never seen it promoted anywhere i suspect there will be no more to follow sadly
<START> all the talent mr <UNK> <UNK> showed in his first 3 movies i thought were all an accident because his 4th one main <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was so bad but i have to say it wasn't an accident this guy is talented and the way he has done vivah is just brilliant right from the first scene it affects you the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome the chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between <UNK> and <UNK> as usual <UNK> <UNK> as the good and loving father is fantastic so is <UNK> <UNK> but its a shahid amrita film amrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong <UNK> this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life all in all a brilliant film hats off to mr <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i almost didn't rent this because of all the bad comments but did anyways i thought it was similar to darkness falls which i also liked the only part i hated about the tooth ferry was the 2 red neck brothers at the gas station they were funny and the dialog made me laugh but this was not a comedy it ruined the movie a bit for me because it was unnecessary the rest of the movie was the way a horror or suspense film should be the make up was good and i have seen way worse movies then this one it was a simple story with believable acting it's not the scariest or <UNK> movie but i wasn't <UNK> off or wanting a <UNK> after watching it on the dvd there was previews of other movies that all look good and i'm gonna check them out
<START> stewart is a <UNK> <UNK> who dreams to make enough money to buy a small ranch in <UNK> <UNK> his only real companion is his sidekick ben <UNK> the great walter <UNK> to accomplish that they drive the cattle clear to <UNK> and on to dawson in canadian territory where they sell them br br along the way they meet the man who runs the gold crazy town behind a <UNK> <UNK> john mcintire he attempts to steal them the herd later in dawson mcintire and his gang <UNK> this time <UNK> with stewart's gold claim br br captured by <UNK> camera in the wonderful scenery of the canadian <UNK> stewart is a thoughtful loner forced into violence by his need to get rid of the <UNK> actions of a corrupt <UNK> robbing local <UNK> of their <UNK> br br in this entertaining beautiful western stewart has two leading ladies to struggle with ruth roman a bit too valuable to describe as a sexy woman <UNK> the worst <UNK> of the territory and the more <UNK> the french canadian girl <UNK> <UNK> who does create a nice portrait of a likable girl with the ability to form a judgment in spontaneous manner stewart is lost between the <UNK> saloon owner and the wife candidate
<START> what great locations a visual challenge to all those who put their eye behind the lens this little jewel is an amazing account of what you can shoot in just 16 days good going folks i can not wait to see what your next feature will be i'll be with you all the way
<START> i can say without a shadow of a doubt that going overboard is the single worst film i have ever seen and yes i have seen <UNK> adam sandler is an abomination as <UNK> <UNK> a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner that's the plot br br that's it nothing else in the film makes sense it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast and not in a wacky naked gun kind of way but more of a frustrating <UNK> both shoes at the t <UNK> kind of way even general <UNK> makes an appearance for no reason i can comprehend it certainly wasn't for humour add to the mix miss australia who has the worst australian accent i've ever <UNK> and you have something which i won't call the worst film ever made because going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film i highly <UNK> seeing this film as it will elevate the standing of every bad film you ever see i guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad film will be at least it wasn't as bad as going overboard
<START> i saw this movie on cable it was really funny from the stereotype police chief to the stereotype big bad guys jay leno and mr <UNK> from karate kid star in this good comedy about a prototype car part i compare this movie to rush hour in which a local cop has to partner up with an asian police officer to solve a case the chase through <UNK> market in downtown detroit brings back memories enjoyable soundtrack good script i give it 10 10
<START> the film did what it set out to do show how a young girl <UNK> with poverty and grows into her maturity however for most of us this subject has been explored adequately and in most instances with more sophistication than done here the movie <UNK> on breasts which soon became boring and i lost interest if this was on tv i would've switched to the latest news on the <UNK> report that's how boring i found this movie
<START> the scenes are fast paced the characters are great i love anne marie <UNK> acting i really like the ending br br however i was disappointed that this movie didn't delve deeper into <UNK> and <UNK> relationship it only <UNK> when they <UNK> each other
<START> i saw this movie last month at a free sneak preview and i walked out it was pretty horrible in the process of trying too hard they over acted and made a horrible movie i was disappointed since i felt all the actors had made respectable choices in the past so this one couldn't be that far off the mark but i was wrong i was hoping they would give out a <UNK> at the end of the movie so i could tell them not to release this movie i was <UNK> in by the free aspect of the preview but it turned out to be a waste of my time and usually i'm very easily amused it tried to be innovative and creative with the shots ideas and filming but because they threw together so many ideas at once it failed i'm not usually <UNK> about movies and i usually don't feel the need to display my opinions about movies but i had to warn everyone not to watch it i <UNK> on imdb just to tell all of you guys
<START> sure this one isn't really a blockbuster nor does it target such a position <UNK> is the first name of a quite popular german musician who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about it is based on the autobiography <UNK> <UNK> wrote a few years ago but isn't meant to be accurate on that the movie is filled with some sexual offensive content at least for american standard which is either amusing not for the other actors of course or dumb it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a <UNK> fan or not technically speaking there isn't much to criticize speaking of me i find this movie to be an ok movie
<START> after seeing all the jesse james <UNK> <UNK> etc films in the fifties it is quite a thrill to see this film with a new perspective by director ang lee the scene of the attack of lawrence kansas is awesome the romantic relationship between jewel and toby <UNK> turns out to be one of the best parts and jonathan rhys meyers is outstanding as the bad guy all the time this film makes you feel the horror of war and the desperate situation of the main characters who do not know if they are going to survive the next hours definitely worth seeing
<START> this film is famous for several qualities a <UNK> script for once in partly religious film making by philip dunne some very good performances a first rate production in every department and its intelligent direction by veteran henry king if one were making a film then getting such talents as leon <UNK> as cinematographer <UNK> <UNK> as art director and alfred newman as composer of original music would guarantee a quality production add the cast of this film including gregory peck and susan <UNK> as the title characters james robertson justice raymond massey <UNK> moore <UNK> meadows and john <UNK> plus a dance by <UNK> <UNK> and expectations might be raised that the resulting film could be made into something special but in a biblical subject script usually a sub genre prone to illogical motivations and <UNK> <UNK> everything would ultimately depend on the author's skills philip dunne here has <UNK> human beings a rare achievement in biblical films david is a man in this film many sided not someone doing mythical deeds on paper in the old testament gregory peck makes him curious passionate self controlled self <UNK> and appealing as <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> the perfect choice but conveys a good deal of common sense <UNK> and emotional <UNK> that helps one see why the king of israel would risk so much for her the rest of the cast is <UNK> and capable by turns the familiar storyline provides them little to work with but author dunne and the cast do as much as is possible with the human situations david's youth is told in flashback how he was chosen by a prophet of <UNK> to be king of israel and earns his way to be second to the king <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> in battle when all else are afraid to beard the giant warrior thereafter he finally is driven from the court of king <UNK> of israel becomes a famous warrior and returns to claim the kingdom and become the <UNK> of death of jonathan the king's son <UNK> a friend his wars are successful the film opens in fact with a successful attack scene but his life is empty since his wife <UNK> <UNK> meadows is <UNK> daughter and is cold to him he turns to <UNK> whom he sees from the palace roof bathing naked later she admits she had hoped he would see her but she has a husband <UNK> when she becomes pregnant it becomes necessary for <UNK> to come in from the battlefield and spend time at home he instead asks david to set him in the <UNK> of the battle even after being <UNK> by <UNK> dance david agrees he is killed a war hero but this does not solve the infidelity question <UNK> comes to israel and the king's infidelity is blamed for the phenomenon at last david places his hands on the <UNK> of the <UNK> recently brought to <UNK> and <UNK> in a temple which has caused the death of others who accidentally came in contact with it <UNK> his god to <UNK> him and nothing happens david <UNK> the temple and finds that rain has come to his <UNK> land this film is always interesting varied in its types of scenes and physically beautiful the director and author make use of the <UNK> principle and are frankly more successful in <UNK> the characters than in almost any film outside the <UNK> near eastern <UNK> <UNK> the feat is a bit easier since neither <UNK> nor religious themes are made central in such adventures well remembered for its glowing realization fine performances and intelligent dialogue this dramatic effort bears repeated study
<START> <UNK> is quite possibly the most incompetent embarrassing pitiful film i have ever seen the acting is criminal the direction practically non existent and the special effects presumably put together by <UNK> a monkey with learning difficulties on a <UNK> <UNK> computer br br far be it from me to <UNK> creativity but i actually believe things like this shouldn't be made i am sure the film makers will say that yes the film was <UNK> by a low as in nothing budget but in that case they just really shouldn't have bothered as it is they have offered the world something so dire so <UNK> that only <UNK> could get the <UNK> <UNK> of enjoyment from it br br starting the movie it wasn't as though i was expecting citizen kane or anything i was expecting a low budget little horror with perhaps a <UNK> of <UNK> a hint of fun and even some energy what i got was the cinematic equivalent of a used <UNK> br br the plot well our <UNK> <UNK> scientist who works in his parents' basement is seen <UNK> stirring some goo in a cup apparently such high level science is the end result of years of research his parents then send him off to a strange hotel type place in the countryside to relax there are some other people there who are simply too awful to write about anyway the scientist drops his test tube onto some <UNK> and soon the <UNK> grow and kill some people wow i'm getting <UNK> just writing the plot summary our heroes save the day by <UNK> a barrel of <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> a <UNK> really a piece of string to it the barrel <UNK> explodes with the power of a small nuclear weapon destroying all the <UNK> the end thank goodness br br that summary is as good as the film gets and actually makes it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is it really should never have got past this stage of development by which i mean a plot outline <UNK> on the back of an <UNK> with <UNK> somebody should have really stepped in and given someone a <UNK> shake and said no br br and those special effects well they're special all right this is cgi gone crazy and done by a person who i can only assume believes the <UNK> <UNK> to be the <UNK> of modern technology and when the <UNK> monsters are not in the style of a 1984 home computer graphics package they are represented by actors <UNK> along covered in a sheet i kid you not br br one of the most <UNK> things about the movie is its <UNK> this can be summed up by the scene in which the hero <UNK> his guns a la clint eastwood and then fails miserably to get them in his <UNK> i mean come on a couple of <UNK> and he could have pulled it off but just to leave it as it is really weak br br i cannot believe money was spent on this camcorder shot rubbish the film makers should hang their heads in shame and be banned from going within fifty <UNK> of any movie making equipment br br i also think it's wrong that friends and family of the makers come onto imdb and post <UNK> reviews and give <UNK> high user ratings which give a totally inaccurate picture of the movie <UNK> is an absolute travesty of film making mr <UNK> is either very very stupid or very very cynical
<START> for a film that's ostensibly about sex and leather it doesn't have any right to be as oddly sweet as it is the story of bettie page a good christian girl from the south who's <UNK> wouldn't let her date until she married who moved to new york and ended up becoming the most successful pin up of her age is driven by an outstanding performance from gretchen <UNK> her page can't quite <UNK> the pictures that she takes <UNK> allowed to touch it's all fun and <UNK> with the pornography trials and supposed ill effects that her images have on the world around her br br page has been an inspiration to every <UNK> artist since not just because she had a figure to die for but because she invested every picture with an innocent sense of fun that was uniquely sexy and simple at the same time rather like this film in fact <UNK> in both black and white and glorious <UNK> it's a lovely way to spend a couple of hours
<START> delirious near plot less mood piece and if it's more <UNK> inspired than the devil then we must remember when it was made after a startling <UNK> opening which even itself is not what it seems we move to soft focus and dream or <UNK> or <UNK> lots of literary and cinematic references and indeed this is the franco film that lang himself praised beautiful and <UNK> the film unfolds at a <UNK> pace but has a <UNK> within each <UNK> a rare movie to <UNK> within old jess could make 'em when he tried fine central performances too including the <UNK> jack taylor and howard <UNK> i haven't even mentioned the <UNK> locations ah
<START> <UNK> is a woman without any interests she just dreams her life away and wonders why she does not feel <UNK> this could be an interesting topic that would need a good story a nice setting and good dialogues it doesn't have any of these this movie is totally boring there are only <UNK> and no <UNK> the only climax is <UNK> khan but although i am a huge fan of his i couldn't stand this movie even he can't make this movie <UNK> the movie is not as bad as king uncle and if you're an art house fan or like it slow you might maybe like it it's not funny it's not interesting it's not catching my recommendation don't watch it
<START> this is one of the most boring horror films i have ever seen as it's absolutely god awful john carradine has very limited screen time all the characters are boring and the story is terrible plus i could see the two twists at the end coming miles away the great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it wasn't so damn boring and there isn't one character to root for either plus i hope it makes it's way to the bottom 100 because it deserves to be there in my opinion when john carradine finally shows up at the end it's a pretty good scene but it's already way too late and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by <UNK> as it was rather gory i got this in a dvd horror set called back from the grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion plus it's lucky this was included in a set i bought otherwise i would have <UNK> this out the window this is one of the most boring horror films i have ever seen as it's absolutely god awful john carradine has very limited screen time and i say avoid it like the plague you don't want to go through the torture the direction is absolutely terrible carl <UNK> does an absolutely terrible job here making every thing look cheap wasting his potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace the acting is just as bad john carradine is good in his scene but other then that he's hardly in the film other then flashback scenes carradine ruled merry <UNK> overacts here terribly as laura as she didn't convince me at all <UNK> <UNK> is ok and somewhat creepy but also <UNK> she did have a creepy smile at the end though rest of the cast i didn't pay enough attention too as i had a lot of trouble getting through it but they were all really bad overall please avoid this it's not worth the agony bomb out of 5
<START> as it is in heaven spoiler warning br br this was a great human drama that <UNK> my emotions and my imagination br br this is a <UNK> <UNK> the life and death of christ daniel is a superior gifted musician who is physically and mentally exhausted by his career and has to give it up when he joins a church choir as its <UNK> he brings about a transformation in the lives of the <UNK> just as jesus did to the society in first century <UNK> they laugh they begin to speak openly and <UNK> to each other their faults are exposed they accept each other come to love each other become a vital community they include the mentally disabled young man <UNK> such is their <UNK> br br the <UNK> <UNK> enjoyed authority through <UNK> a <UNK> morality on the <UNK> and that is gradually rejected by the <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> daniel there is a revolt and <UNK> is crushed <UNK> represents the jewish authorities of <UNK> day whose <UNK> on <UNK> to the jewish law provided a stark contrast to the new life by the golden rule brought by jesus br br in one dramatic scene someone declares the church invented sin all through the film there is this contrast between moral <UNK> and vital living being br br true to the christ story daniel is killed by <UNK> when he beats him up leaves him to <UNK> in the river next scene we can hardly believe it when <UNK> <UNK> body is dragged into his room the tomb <UNK> in a white <UNK> sheet the <UNK> by three women three women kept <UNK> at the foot of the cross in the <UNK> br br daniel is drawn closely to lena a warm beautiful young woman who has been betrayed by a man she loved and who is now <UNK> jesus developed a close relationship with mary <UNK> lena who was probably a high class <UNK> prostitute through lena daniel learns to love something he has <UNK> for and now finds <UNK> br br the solo sung by <UNK> composed by daniel is all about living a full life in contrast to moral correctness that leads to concern about sin and what's right and wrong br br the final scene shows the choir all singing <UNK> in harmony like a <UNK> drawing in the large audience <UNK> the harmony and inter <UNK> that is our true human destiny
<START> i used to love watching sabrina the teenage witch friday nights on <UNK> <UNK> i think this was one of the best shows on <UNK> my friends and i used to get together every friday just to watch this show and we never missed an episode br br my favorite character was <UNK> he was adorable and <UNK> funny i liked <UNK> boyfriend harvey too he was hot i think melissa joan hart played a good teenage witch too my favorite episodes were sabrina through the looking glass and <UNK> and <UNK> the teenage years those episodes were great br br overall i really miss this show i hope one day abc brings it back with new episodes i give this show 10 10 stars
<START> i like bad movies i like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip on them for their duration then there are <UNK> movies like this <UNK> is not just a bad movie but a telling sign that maybe the american movie industry should please for the sake of the viewer at least <UNK> scripts before funding a movie br br if a stereotype took a crap this movie would <UNK> from that the storyline is unbearable and the acting all around is laughable <UNK> <UNK> and eddie <UNK> have perhaps the worst screen chemistry i've seen in a good while and even <UNK> they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of <UNK> until they change their profession to street <UNK> about the only thing they can <UNK> qualify for furthermore how <UNK> <UNK> got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that i can't even think of an <UNK> i am a loyal fan of his but this has made me question him br br to sum it up several people want revenge for different reasons and if you care enough to know what they are you're a bigger person than me so much so that it turns to violence i guess the movie is like <UNK> the snake that <UNK> its own tail in that it's an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears this movie is essentially one big car commercial for the first half and an <UNK> action movie for the rest it should be avoided at any and all costs br br i wish i could find one positive aspect to this movie and i think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits do roll br br p s <UNK> <UNK> if that was you singing those two songs in this movie then you are a hack and i hope old age <UNK> you br br p s s if you do rent this movie looking for a laughable experience listen for the lyrics to <UNK> <UNK> awesome songs
<START> granted this seems like a good idea steve martin goldie hawn and john <UNK> in a neil simon comedy where can you go wrong watch the movie and you'll find out br br in truth martin the lead is <UNK> cast he's not doing the great slapstick he's known for from movies like the jerk but instead plays a sort of in between character that doesn't work hawn with no one to play off of is terrible <UNK> is the only even partially funny member br br to top it off the plot is pretty stupid i can't say how much of it may have been changed but the characters seem to lack the slightest bit of common sense they <UNK> through new york not doing anything right and <UNK> nothing funny not only is the whole premise completely unbelievable it seems to give the message that people who don't live in new york aren't very bright a theme repeated throughout the movie br br in <UNK> instead of seeing this go rent the original odd couple again
<START> this movie was kind of interesting i had to watch it for a college class about india however the synopsis tells you this movie is about one thing when it doesn't really contain much cold hard information on those details it is not really true to the synopsis until the very end where they <UNK> try to tie all the elements together the gore factor is superb however even right at the very beginning you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense only watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it i've seen rumors on other <UNK> about this movie being based on true events however you can not find any information about it online so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch
<START> what a horrible comedy totally lame the supposed humor was simple and stupid <UNK> <UNK> a great actor had the only parts worth <UNK> at and he was tied up and <UNK> at the time don't waste your time with this one it deserves a 0 10
<START> a classy offering from <UNK> producer <UNK> <UNK> and director peter <UNK> 'the far <UNK> etc turn in a classy intelligent <UNK> <UNK> with a strong cast peter cushing christopher lee jon pertwee ingrid pitt etc all giving stylish performances despite a low budget which results in a few <UNK> special <UNK> the most outstanding contribution however is that of the 7 year old chloe <UNK> who turns in <UNK> effective account of her part which makes one's blood run cold only <UNK> by the lurid title wished on the film by its <UNK> this underrated release a cut above the run of the mill <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> shocker movie is for those who appreciate a little thought with their horror
<START> i watch lots of scary movies or at least they try to be and this has to be the worst if not 2nd worst movie i have ever had to make myself try to sit through i never knew the depths of <UNK> until i rented this piece of <UNK> cheese covered in a used <UNK> <UNK> i am a fan of julian sans but this is worse than i would hope for him br br on the other hand the story was promising and i was intrigued for the first minute and a half while the credits rolled and i had yet to see what pain looked like first hand perhaps there are some viewers out there that enjoyed this and can point me in the right direction but then again i know of those viewers who understand if not <UNK> me especially when we had to turn the video off and that simply is not done with our watching we had to make one exception obviously br br if it were up for a remake i'd give it a chance so long as they had at most 1 of the original <UNK> into it that's all
<START> i saw true crime when it was first released back in the mid nineties and i have watched it many times since it is a great mystery about mary played by alicia <UNK> a high school senior in a california town who's <UNK> younger sister was tortured and killed by an unknown murderer mary meets tony played by kevin dillon a police <UNK> who sees how bright she is and they decide to work together to try to find the killer br br many suspects in this one true crime feels very true or real to me i read a <UNK> review where someone wrote that total suspension of disbelief is present here and it is so true alicia <UNK> is perfect in this role and kevin dillon and bill <UNK> do a great job as do the other actors the locations are right on and the writer director pat <UNK> really captures some of the realities of teenage life and of <UNK> loneliness see the scene where mary <UNK> from the dream sequence after having viewed the photos she took of tony i wish <UNK> would make more movies br br i have not seen any other movie quite like true crime 10 10
<START> utterly predictable silly show about a man who has killed his wife by <UNK> her down when driving and claimed he had <UNK> out why was he still driving a car why did he still feel able to drive a car having killed his wife with one this question has not occurred to the writers the story then <UNK> on about a psychologist and her failing marriage which is tied into the failing marriage of wife killing <UNK> driver an <UNK> mother and one dimensional child are thrown in for good measure and the whole builds up to a predictable denouement and crashing finale are police <UNK> so easily taken in <UNK> writing that the actors do their best with but they are doomed to failure this is on a par with a <UNK> romance don't waste your time watching this one unless that's what you are aiming for
<START> no one should ever try to adapt a tom robbins book for screen while the movie is fine and the performances are good the dialogue which works well reading it is crap when spoken or to put it another way no one would be likely to suggest that hearing someone else's name was like seeing it written in <UNK> on a pearl br br overall the movie feels like a badly adapted <UNK> notes to the book most of the parts have been <UNK> down to a fifth of their size in the book in terms of <UNK> and current story and the ending is wildly and <UNK> different from that of the book most of the plots from the book have gotten lost including the one that makes everything make sense at the end and there's more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say huh not a worthy effort unfortunately the script should have been read compared to the book burned and all the actors sent off to do something far better i admire gus van <UNK> tremendously but not even someone of his <UNK> could have made a decent movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries
<START> i question anyone saying they don't care for this movie some reviewers have said it didn't have enough action some said it was too long etc don't listen to them if you like <UNK> redemption and or braveheart you will definitely love this movie br br the acting performances are superb tim roth john hurt and jessica lang are <UNK> and liam neeson does an <UNK> job and is a very <UNK> character because of his size the <UNK> was brilliant and breathtaking it is <UNK> of the few movies i have seen in my life along with <UNK> that was virtually flawless from casting directing writing acting etc br br i was amazed this wasn't in the top 50 or 100 movies reviewed i felt so <UNK> about it that i just <UNK> with imdb so i could let everyone know the real scoop i have seen this movie about 10 times each time with a different person and everyone has loved it you must be awake and pay attention carefully for the first 30 minutes because they introduce quite a few characters in the beginning if you have the attention span longer than most of these <UNK> kids writing reviews for the movies on this site than you will love this movie come on all 3 lord of the rings movies in the top 9 and the matrix at <UNK> that should show you the age range of most reviewers here br br this is a top 50 movie
<START> david <UNK> is a rich good looking guy who lives in new york city when his <UNK> <UNK> julie <UNK> gets very jealous after david falls for spanish beauty <UNK> she gets david into her car and tells him that he's the only guy she loves and wants to be with but seeing as he's in love with <UNK> she decides to commit suicide with david in the car with her by driving off a bridge david survives the crash but is left with a <UNK> face he is then charged with the murder of julie the thing is david doesn't know what's real and what's not as he keeps having these strange dreams most of which are actually nightmares and flashbacks some of which just don't make sense to him everything will soon come back to him though as he's begins to find out the truth br br well there's an all star cast here including tom cruise <UNK> <UNK> cameron diaz kurt russell jason lee and <UNK> taylor who all give good performances in the movie in the movie they all put off different things about there characters like happiness sadness angry etc really well there's also a cameo in the movie from the brilliant steven spielberg br br vanilla sky is a well made different interesting and original movie which will leave you talking about it a lot after it's finished it's not just a thriller but it's a real psychological thriller the trailer for the movie is really good but the movie is so different from what it might be made out to be it's been directed very well and there were a couple of really great scenes here too all in all an enjoyable movie which should be really be paid attention too they are sure making a lot of are they dead if not who is dead movies recently
<START> every now and then there gets released this movie no one has ever heard of and got shot in a very short time with very little money and <UNK> but everybody goes crazy about and turns out to be a surprisingly great one this also happened in the <UNK> with quite a few little movies that not a lot of people have ever heard of there are really some unknown great surprising little <UNK> from the <UNK> that are worth digging out panic in the streets is another movie like that that springs to the mind both are movies that aren't really like the usual genre flicks from their time and are also made with limited resources br br i was really surprised at how much i ended up liking this movie it was truly a movie that got better and better as it progressed like all <UNK> movies it tends to begin sort of slow but once you get into the story and it's characters you're in for a real treat with this movie br br the movie has a really great story that involves espionage though the movie doesn't start of like that it begins as this typical crime thriller with a touch of film noir to it but pickup on south street just isn't really a movie by the numbers so it starts to take its own directions pretty soon on it <UNK> that the movie remains a surprising but above all also really refreshing one to watch br br i also really liked the characters within this movie none of them are really good guys and they all of their flaws and weaknesses really <UNK> it also especially features a great performance from thelma ritter who even received a well deserved oscar nomination for it has really got to be one of the greatest female roles i have ever seen br br even despite its somewhat obvious low budget this is simply one great original special little movie that deserves to be seen by more br br 10 10
<START> i haven't seen this in over <UNK> but i still remember things about it br br this film could not have been made in color the stark <UNK> are what make it and was life really that simple in the 1950's what stands out the most in my memory is perry smith going to the <UNK> his breathing under the hood just before they <UNK> the trap i don't think i could watch that again once is plenty it's like that <UNK> guy at the beginning of <UNK> who is dragged out in terror to the <UNK> the guy that said watch this on a double bill with dead man walking should have added the last 10 minutes of i want to live as well br br some of my <UNK> being <UNK> went to the <UNK> in <UNK> 95 so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense
<START> two years later bill alex winter and ted keanu reeves are becoming near rock stars in the present future but still needing more work in their <UNK> in the future bill ted are in the public popular history but then a evil man <UNK> <UNK> is set to kill bill ted by sending cyborg look likes to destroy them <UNK> are sent to the past present and they actually murder the real bill ted now both guys are spirits and they have to travel through heaven and hell to save themselves and their future br br directed by peter <UNK> tom and <UNK> the <UNK> made a clever sequel with terrific visual effects much more funny and entertaining than the original william <UNK> the <UNK> redemption steals the show as the grim <UNK> br br dvd has an good <UNK> widescreen 1 85 1 transfer and an fine <UNK> digital 5 1 surround sound dvd has the theatrical trailer and an amusing behind the scenes <UNK> this sequel was a box office hit like the original but it is also believe it or not one of the best sequels ever made depending on your point of view george <UNK> <UNK> his role from the original briefly pam <UNK> also appears in a bit role it's a enjoyable fantasy comedy
<START> my god <UNK> masterpiece is one of the best movies i've ever seen closer to peter <UNK> and jean luc <UNK> movies this one is really disturbing but not gruesome as the <UNK> all the little stories have a deep <UNK> interest and the directing is totally inventive in spite of the lack of money see the bridge sketch highly highly recommended
<START> in light of bad reviews or car crashes i feel possessed to get in gear and make a <UNK> to give merit where due and do a service i'm not sure people have license to say it was so bad almost automatically br br it's rare for a movie to have suspense this movie <UNK> suspense it's whole length for me despite any flaws that may be how many films can say that not even many big ones because of the simple premise you don't know if the people will get out of the life threatening situation which lasts the whole movie <UNK> the suspension was tight and over some <UNK> the shocks did their work it's not just a tv movie but an all action movie there is no point where it stops or <UNK> or becomes talky it would be hard to make a film like this always on the road only duel or speed are this that i recall the best thing in them also was the constant tension br br acting is not bad the judge is as good as ever and the others are br br script is good but the jury is out as to whether it sometimes may be or seem to be a little awry what seems unrealistic is not necessarily so your first <UNK> are not always right but i think the lead actor's was right in being in this movie br br stunts are mostly terrific especially for a tv movie their only failing may be the noticeable and again apparent slow speed but we all know how <UNK> slow grand <UNK> cars can look br br i liked that the beginning said inspired by a true story so you are not going to go how much is true you know just the basis is the usual based on a true story makes me think it should mostly be true but maybe that's my error br br how to save them good idea of the reviewer to suggest a <UNK> truck to lift the back <UNK> up just a few <UNK> would do a stunt driver could do that at 100 <UNK> odd that they didn't call a car expert or auto <UNK> or mechanic to see if there's a way br br i hope this review has put in reverse that this film is a disaster or at least neutral and help it become a runaway success br br <UNK> quality is a little soft for a dvd br br spoiler they would have been <UNK> out after the baby was but strangely that life saving idea was cleverly dealt with in some joking conversation to fade it out i guess we know why end of movie suspension of disbelief went out the top window with the baby
<START> one could wish that an idea as good as the invisible man would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects but this is not the case the story the characters and finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad scientist flick from the early 50's there are some great moments mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets but alas soon we're back in the <UNK> <UNK> of the underground lab which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable but <UNK> br br there has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past 10 years and some of them have their charms but it's becoming <UNK> and <UNK> for each film that the idea of putting ol' classics under the <UNK> of eager <UNK> like verhoeven who does have his moments is a very bad one it is obvious that the money is the key issue here the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough and as a result hollow man is seriously <UNK> with clichés sappy characters predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever br br however the one thing that actually impressed me beside the special effects was the swearing when making this kind of film modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them therefore the language and sometimes the violence and sex is very toned down when the whole world blows up the good guys go oh darn and oh my god hollow man <UNK> <UNK> that kind of <UNK> and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them i'm not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear but it makes it more believable if someone actually <UNK> i think we can thank verhoeven for that

<START> kurt russell is so believable and the action so non stop that it takes thinking about it afterward to realize that there were honest to goodness important themes <UNK> fear of the stranger learning to rise above early <UNK> the strength that love and friendship can bring etc in the storyline this is so very rare for a <UNK> action <UNK> that even i who thinks most a a is violent <UNK> liked the film and have recommended it to every guy i know it's a shame this one was overlooked because by rights it should have been one of the biggest action adventure box office hits it has something for everyone without <UNK> <UNK> or losing the nearly non stop action moments i'm afraid the answer to it not becoming a hit lies in the fact that adults did not go to see it anyone under 20 probably has not only seen more violent action in their video games but probably would either not catch the multi layered multi themed beauty or not care about it this film could <UNK> anyone who avoids a a as mindless violence if a guy takes his lady or <UNK> it or sees it in a cable listing to see this film he'll be much more likely to get her to go with him to other action flicks

<START> i saw this film yesterday i rented the dvd from blockbuster in fact i know one of the actresses from the film i won't say who that's kept under <UNK> but i must admit it wasn't as good as i thought it would be tom <UNK> hats down to this guy but it's a shame he wasn't in the film for long what lacks the film is the idea the script sound etc it may look like a good movie but it wasn't that entertaining br br well i'm glad my sister paid <UNK> for renting 3 dvd's from blockbuster i chose this one and i was disappointed anyway thumbs down for me not my cup of tea 0 out of 10
<START> i am 13 and i hated this film its the worst film on earth i totally wasted my time watching it and was disappointed with it cause on the cover and on the back the film it looks pretty good but i was wrong its bad but when i saw <UNK> she was totally different and a bad actress and i really didn't know how old the 2 girls was trying to be i was so confused the film was in some parts confusing and i didn't enjoy it at all but i watched all the film just to see if it was going to get better but it didn't it was boring dull and did i say boring and i don't think many other people liked it as well as me boring boring boring
<START> like <UNK> <UNK> this attempts to make a point about the treatment of vietnam vets but there really isn't much time for that in between the monotonous <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> torture and explosions as an <UNK> <UNK> rambo takes out half of asia a ton of <UNK> soldiers most of the russian army various vehicles and anything else he can point a rocket <UNK> at the only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon <UNK> off allowing the <UNK> to reach dangerous levels and the script to <UNK> into a succession of loud noises <UNK> <UNK> a few hackneyed musical <UNK> is jerry <UNK> who carefully <UNK> off all the clichéd themes from russian rat a <UNK> to chinese <UNK> chang chong just in case we don't quite understand who we're looking at stallone has a brain in his head this empty nonsense is beneath him
<START> i was literally preparing to hate this movie so believe me when i say this film is worth seeing overall the story and gags are contrived but the film has the charm and <UNK> to pull them off that gag where jason lee thinks he has <UNK> and tries not to let his boss future father in law and co workers see him scratching himself isn't terribly intelligent but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter very few of the film's gags are high brow but they made me laugh as i said the film has charm and charm can go a long way br br the characters are likable too i must say i wish i got to see more of james <UNK> character since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in plus i admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife who serves as the <UNK> in the plot a total witch the <UNK> blair character is hardly unlikable and there's never a scene where i thought to myself why did he want to marry her in the first place the ending is hollywood ish but it could've been much more <UNK> br br the cast is talented i haven't had a <UNK> view of most of jason lee's mainstream work i just loved him so much in kevin smith's films that i couldn't help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles and he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles even in this movie he doesn't look perfectly comfortable but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene but i still miss his work in independent films julia stiles proves again why she's so damn likable of course she's a very beautiful girl with a <UNK> smile that makes me want to faint but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality in other words her beauty shows inside and out i don't know the <UNK> name but the woman who plays the drunk <UNK> is hilarious julie <UNK> also has a small part and she's always enjoyable to watch which makes me wish she received better roles i loved her so much in airplane and lost in america that it's a shame she doesn't get the same opportunities to <UNK> her skills br br don't be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records this is a funny charming film romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be <UNK> down the toilet so it's always to see a good one among all these bad <UNK> br br my score 7 out of 10
<START> <UNK> bound is a beautiful film <UNK> the part where shadow falls down the <UNK> <UNK> i cried considering i was only six i cried it takes a lot to make me cry the dogs and the cat are excellently trained a nice family movie not for completely hardened non <UNK> people or animal <UNK> but could for soft as crap a k a people like me br br a good film overall 10 10
<START> <UNK> i really loved this movie and it particularly moved me the two main actors are giving us such great performances that at the end it is really heart breaking to know what finally happened to their characters br br the <UNK> between barbra streisand and kris kristofferson is marvelous and the song are just great the way they are br br that's why i didn't feel surprised when i learned it had won 5 golden globe awards the most rewarded movie at the golden <UNK> an oscar and even a <UNK> this movie is a classic that deserves to be seen by anyone a great movie that has often been criticized maybe because streisand <UNK> to get involved in it surely as a co director her artistry is the biggest and that will surely please you
<START> i just saw valentine and i have to say that it was the best slasher movie that i've seen in years unlike the recent trend of 90's horror flicks this movie is more concerned with being eerie than it is with being self mocking for those out there that hated scream there is not one reference to the horror rules in this movie even though the old slasher movie rules do apply here br br this is the perfect blend of 80's and 90's horror you get the style cinematography and good acting of 90's films and the stalking slasher madness of an 80's flick i guess the year 2001 is going to finally give horror fans the kind of movies they were longing for this is definitely a move in the right direction br br denise richards stands out here as a fun character you can tell she liked her role and that makes her stand out i loved her in this movie
<START> if there's one thing that <UNK> me most in seeing a bad film it's seeing it done by experienced film makers who ought to know better this re imagining of planet of the apes could have used some imagination to say nothing of essential elements of character development <UNK> the girl in the original planet of the apes was a better developed character than <UNK> in this version for all that she does not say a single word one certainly expected a lot better from tim burton a man who has <UNK> combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence wit and humour all of which were notably absent from this production br br there were problems in basic plot development the first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk this was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made all the difference in the original film even while he was mute his ability to communicate was what marked out <UNK> taylor as being different from the other humans in the current film mark <UNK> encourages the talking human slaves to revolt but there is no <UNK> reason for them to have not <UNK> and <UNK> their <UNK> already they are <UNK> tool users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans something mute humans can't do it needs no man to fall from the stars to save them indeed since he comes from a technological <UNK> and finds himself in a pre technology era without at first any <UNK> to help him it is <UNK> who ought to be at a <UNK> not the humans who are used to living there br br it was sad to see helena bonham carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that <UNK> brick wall mark <UNK> her best scenes were with the villainous tim roth br br the humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act at which point <UNK> started showing some actual interest in <UNK> <UNK> and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a <UNK> <UNK> ho freedom fighter this was poor character development <UNK> warren in particular looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script <UNK> <UNK> at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me as he has <UNK> <UNK> with the humans throughout br br creating the apes half a plus point and two <UNK> ape make up was excellent on the males particularly michael clarke <UNK> who has incredibly <UNK> eyes which was why he was so good in the green mile and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully but the ape females looked like nothing on earth neither ape nor human the <UNK> were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as flash <UNK> rocket jumping apes looked as if they'd just been fired from a <UNK> they had none of the long <UNK> grace of genuine apes secondly the poor sound mixing when the <UNK> <UNK> it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal probably <UNK> making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic br br in the original film the various human things the apes do and say are handled as light relief i never knew an ape i didn't like human see human do here the apes just talk matter of <UNK> exactly as 21st century humans do and there is no humour in it at all the only genuinely original idea was <UNK> writing with her feet br br nothing made me cringe more than the v <UNK> from star trek moment near the end of the film first of all the apes had apparently been able to read roman <UNK> in the distant past for them to know the name of the forbidden zone in its partly <UNK> form secondly the mysterious <UNK> giving the name is merely covered with sand which <UNK> just <UNK> away something any ape could have done centuries ago this moment was for me far worse than the much <UNK> ending of the movie br br things of that nature however are typical of most science fiction movies of today back in the '60s and '70s they generally didn't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional i'm thinking of 2001 a space odyssey the 1967 planet of the apes <UNK> soylent green silent running and the 1972 <UNK> the first planet of the apes even <UNK> the only <UNK> valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time however this film includes just about every bad science fiction cliché going space <UNK> <UNK> and worm holes straight out of star trek the planets of the <UNK> system and their <UNK> apparently all visible together as large <UNK> in reality from any one planet all other bodies even their own <UNK> are just points of light a conventional rocket powered <UNK> travelling from <UNK> to earth in a matter of minutes instead of years two thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero <UNK> the button to say nothing of a conveniently <UNK> internal glass door in a contemporary setting you'd have to explain why it was bullet proof but because it's science fiction you don't have to br br overall <UNK> most disappointing film
<START> <UNK> could have been a great vehicle for <UNK> leigh cook but the director cut out her best scenes in the scenes that she are in she is just a zombie she is involved in a sub plot that is <UNK> to a sub plot in get carter but she handles the sub plot better in get carter i blame the director the director's homage to hitchcock was corny it's the scene were ryan <UNK> <UNK> realizes he may not be able to trust tim <UNK> <UNK> at least i think it's a homage to hitchcock the dvd shows the scenes that were cut out i think the director should have trust his instincts and not listen to the test audiences
<START> dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love wanders is probably not the word i should say he <UNK> on the past girlfriend he recalls to the day when the relationship ended the dream sequences only lack the <UNK> transitions he <UNK> recalls their favorite songs and places they went i'm not a <UNK> but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age also divorced who instead of being turned off by his creepiness starts to become interested in him did i mention how creepy dave is he sometimes refers to himself in the third person he doesn't move his arms when he walks either it's just weird too make a long story short dave plots to hunt down mary the old gal friend and kill her <UNK> i mean confront her he does so which was really creepy he believes her to be married yet he still flies half way across the country to meet her he stakes out her house to make sure she is alone before he drops in on her he has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the <UNK> of christ in about 10 words or less and flies back to the new young girlfriend we enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value i am still entertaining the wife with my dave impressions i heard another dave mary song
<START> there's so many things to fall for in <UNK> <UNK> en la <UNK> del <UNK> inside the killer's mind that it's very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning let's just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really really great done it´s made with super 8 black and white shots 35 <UNK> color interviews flashbacks <UNK> <UNK> it´s like a movie made a <UNK> or <UNK> which most peculiar aspect <UNK> on the doubt that leaves you wondering did he really ever existed the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in <UNK> worked in a religious mission and then killed some people an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced the movie starts because some french <UNK> got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death nowadays some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character the one we are witness of the movie br br for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside <UNK> mind mainly in order to <UNK> why he did what he has done nevertheless the important thing is that the filmmakers never gives us a sided point of view they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions we clearly never justify them so the first half is based upon <UNK> information later things turn into <UNK> childhood giving the movie such an incredible new force even tough never got weak or boring br br i don't mean and don't want to spoil anything so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you believe me the trip to see it is more than worthy
<START> i put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home because i had packed away all their toys <UNK> don't like to watch <UNK> and <UNK> lee or the view my four year old found one scene funny but told me the rest of it was too silly this is a four year old folks anyone over the age of say nine will want to kill their television rather than let this one play itself out br br to say this movie is bad is like saying the holocaust was a little mistake there are no words for how ridiculous and utterly terrible this film truly is the acting is bad the plot is stupid and the script is <UNK> unfunny since this is supposed to be a comedy the fact that you cannot even laugh at the badness of the movie makes it even worse bronson <UNK> <UNK> is the worst with some weird fake accent irish <UNK> <UNK> cockney <UNK> as far as i could tell but all the characters are awful i haven't watched a real laurel and hardy film in ages but i know that they had to be way better than this what is the point of ruining a classic comic duo with this br br bottom line derivative garbage avoid at all costs unless you have some freaky bronson <UNK> fetish 2 10
<START> as a physics student i've become aware of many idiot <UNK> and other so called experts in the field as i continue with my studies i learn more and more about real physics experiments going on and about the people who are doing things right br br then my friends tell me of this physics movie they want to see knowing nothing of it i'm excited hoping that the information will be presented well br br i've done real quantum <UNK> this wasn't it br br this movie starts with the basic <UNK> that anything that occurs to a <UNK> <UNK> can and will occur to you if you just open your eyes let's think about that for just a moment br br our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10 30 such <UNK> <UNK> that is a million billion billion billion <UNK> the more mysterious quantum effects of just two <UNK> can have a 50 <UNK> of <UNK> each other out completely as you add more and more <UNK> into the mix it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result to tell us to believe that this is a valid <UNK> with no <UNK> behind it it's just stupid br br my friend also in physics and i counted 3 facts during the course of this movie but they were presented in the most misleading manner i've ever seen br br i cannot say as much for the <UNK> portion of the movie as i have not had any kind of medical training it seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it remembering my days in <UNK> but i cannot say br br at least this film had a redeeming quality the dancing <UNK> or whatever they actually were scene not to ruin the <UNK> plot that drives this movie but the main character goes to a wedding where she sees all different types of personalities driven by their <UNK> and then the film cuts to the dance floor where we are spliced between people dancing sometimes surrounded by cg <UNK> and a fully cg scene filled with dancing <UNK> the film at that point was trying to tell us how we're addicted to emotions so we're treated to the full song of that smash hit addicted to love br br this scene was redeeming because anyone who could go through that scene and still take this movie seriously well you are the ones that need to open your eyes
<START> i first saw this movie on some movie channel hbo some time ago i was a fan of public enemy <UNK> and other early rap and had seen <UNK> in theaters anyway the <UNK> for it caught my eye and i wanted to see what it was all about well right off the bat i knew it was going to be good warning and i was right the parody songs alone make this movie worth watching over and over my <UNK> but the overall flow and delivery of the movie was great you've got to love the satire of rap groups obviously <UNK> certain <UNK> <UNK> e <UNK> <UNK> ice cube and the humor of the three members of <UNK> who can forget tone deaf scratching with his ass it's too bad this movie didn't get the credit it deserved as it was overshadowed by <UNK> during their releases but in my opinion is a much better film if you know and like 90's <UNK> rap you'll be watching and laughing with this movie for a long time if you aren't into or don't like <UNK> you'll enjoy the jokes at the expense of the genre
<START> okay i'll confess this is the movie that made me love what michael keaton could do he does a beautiful parody of someone doing a parody of james cagney with charm to spare br br the supporting cast are solid workers all and will step right up and do a fine job in this '80s comedy a spoof of the <UNK> <UNK> gangster movies it breaks new ground constantly with remarkably original material well yeah some of it has been copied since but when this movie was made it was original and much of it has not been copied elsewhere watch joe <UNK> warn people to not do with one of the great <UNK> of spoofs watch roman <UNK> do things with english profanity that would make your <UNK> <UNK> teacher laugh watch amazing sight gags such as pet store owner johnny kelly using the price tag gun on his <UNK> and <UNK> his <UNK> watch the greatest warning against sex educational film ever made watch the most amazing <UNK> of church latin done while a guy who never took shop class <UNK> a thompson machine gun from parts watch lines you'll be using in casual conversation for the next decade watch maureen <UNK> do the perfect <UNK> to the hard working mom with surprise gags that you'll never see coming br br if you see a gag that doesn't hit your funny bone be patient another will come along in 30 seconds or less and the odds are you'll need to pause until you're done rolling on the floor several times <UNK> and <UNK> them too watch for the subtle stuff some of the sight gags can go by <UNK> the first few viewings br br there are a few minor flaws but it's probably the best of the spoofs some come close but none of them are quite this good
<START> i always found <UNK> drake rather creepy and this movie <UNK> that as another review said this is a stalker movie that isn't very funny i watched it because it has cg in it but he hardly gets any screen time it's no north by <UNK>
<START> well you might not actually see any women in love in this movie but you'll certainly hear women talking about love and men talking about love and women talking about men and men talking about women and men talking about men and everyone talking about death and talking and talking until you yourself will want to scream and do something that requires no talking at all like paint your bedroom or water your plants br br welcome to the world of d h lawrence where psycho <UNK> <UNK> supreme and where no one can get down to living a <UNK> life because everyone is too busy talking about how <UNK> their lives are spending time with the characters in a d h lawrence novel is like being locked in a closet with a group of your most self absorbed <UNK> who you would run away from if you met them at a party when i read women in love i so desperately wanted to <UNK> every single character in it but since i couldn't i was hoping they would at least <UNK> each other alas only one of them dies not by <UNK> and i won't spoil it for you by telling which one in case you actually give a damn about this story or any of these people br br to give director ken russell his due he makes this filmed version about as entertaining as it's possible to make this essentially <UNK> novel he throws out much of the psychological <UNK> <UNK> that lawrence <UNK> and focuses instead on all of the naughty parts so we get lots of <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> and fields two buck naked men wrestling by <UNK> and one embarrassing scene featuring alan bates <UNK> buck naked again <UNK> around in a <UNK> making love to <UNK> and grass i'm not kidding glenda jackson won an oscar for her performance as <UNK> the more <UNK> of the two sisters at the story's focus and she certainly tries her hardest to do something with this material anyone would deserve an oscar simply for having to bear <UNK> decision to give her a scene where she has to dance wildly in front of a herd of <UNK> looking cattle oliver reed has one expression an intense <UNK> the whole thing is over written and over directed and it's <UNK> campy indeed this <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> as perhaps the most unintentionally hysterical movie i've ever seen br br grade d
<START> if you're after the real story of early <UNK> painter artemisia <UNK> you'll be disappointed however if you're after a reasonably crafted <UNK> <UNK> with an art theme you've found you're movie br br this film is such a <UNK> inaccurate depiction of artemisia <UNK> life that it almost made me <UNK> type in artemisia inaccuracies in <UNK> and check out some of the fact vs fiction <UNK> from a purely technical point of view though the film was alright the sets costumes and especially the <UNK> lighting helped create an <UNK> early <UNK> century experience although the above mentioned glaring factual inaccuracies let it down a bit br br i wonder how the director co writer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her film at the time perhaps she refused to portray artemisia as a victim which would've been unfortunate because lets face it she was
<START> with rapid <UNK> of scenes of insane people in an asylum and montage <UNK> of images and vague <UNK> <UNK> this is a very hard movie to follow apparently a man <UNK> <UNK> takes a job as a porter or janitor in an asylum so he can be near his imprisoned wife and maybe to rescue her but she's clearly mad <UNK> on the floor with a <UNK> expression much of the time and fear misery and confusion written on her face the rest of the time the film maker switches to her point of view sometimes and we see vague images of her at the side of a pond drowning a baby or <UNK> at a drowned child she's tormented by something when the point of view shifts to her or other mad folks the filmmaker uses <UNK> <UNK> and such things showing us what mad people see and then how they react and the place is <UNK> with mad folks laughing hiding and in one case dancing <UNK> night and day at one point the man tries to take his wife outside but the night outside the door <UNK> her and she runs back to her cell gradually the man slips into a nightmare in which he's interrupted in another attempt to steal her away and he kills the doctor and many <UNK> and all the while the mad folk laugh and applaud when he wakes he is <UNK> and <UNK> the floor some fascinating shots of <UNK> life streets buildings in the 1920s
<START> a lot of people unfairly sh t on this series but several of the guinea pig videos are fairly entertaining devil's experiment in particular has some really fantastic effects work not just the infamous <UNK> scene but also a very realistic skin slice on the foot and a hand breaking with a <UNK> are very realistic especially for the <UNK> vintage and low budget br br let me start at the beginning now for those who don't know this film is an extreme torture fake snuff film that <UNK> in japan in the mid 80s it's plot as it stands is simple a young girl is held by a few men and forced to <UNK> a series of brutal <UNK> to see where her breaking point is this <UNK> brutal violence all effectively realistic effects including the ones mentioned in the last paragraph as well as a painful looking <UNK> of hot oil to the captive girl's arm and placing of <UNK> in the subsequent <UNK> wound br br the least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session where three men take turns <UNK> the hell out of the girl as her head falls about and a second sequence where the three men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the ground these two scenes are obviously staged and detract from the realism of the rest of the proceedings br br the actress who plays the victim of the experiment is pretty convincing at being in pain and takes a good amount of abuse and rough stuff on camera her reactions as she has <UNK> <UNK> to her head and loud noises are played for hours on end are chilling some of the other abuse she takes is being strung up in a net from a tree during the only times she is given a rest also there is a disturbing scene where the <UNK> <UNK> through guts at her and one other <UNK> sleazy scene where she is <UNK> in an office chair and forced to drink a bottle of jack daniels till she <UNK> br br if you haven't seen this series i hope i have helped you decide whether or not you want to give this episode a shot 8 5 10 for devil's experiment
<START> i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role gandolfini gives his typical a performance the entire cast is funny the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome i went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why i was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and <UNK> exhausted i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy can identify with loneliness during the holidays and or putting up with the relatives the best part to this film to me anyway were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped namely the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree go see it and have a good laugh
<START> a dying kung fu master sends out his last student in order to track down what happened to the previous five students who were members of the banned poison clan he is to see if they are acting for good and if not he his to stop them the master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran off with the <UNK> money which the master wants used for good the earlier students were all taught in a different style snake <UNK> <UNK> lizard <UNK> while the last student was taught a little in each style all of the students end up in one town looking for the old man with all of the money and soon everyone is battling to get the money br br classic martial arts film has title that even many non fans know i've spoken with a couple of casual fans and this seems to be the one film that sticks in their head its a very good movie though i'm not really sure why this film stays with people when for my money there are other films that are better from the shaw studio one armed <UNK> or the brave archer series for example this isn't to sell the film short its not since the film is structured like a mystery our hero has no clue who anyone is and the <UNK> themselves only know at best who two of the others is we're given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is the film is also odd in that for a martial arts film other than a training sequence at the start and the killing of the old man and his family for the money there is really no action for about 40 or 45 minutes its a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and the performances hold your attention the film is also odd in that its the first martial arts film i think i've ever seen where there are no women i don't think one has a speaking role and i'm pretty sure that none appear in the background its <UNK> of nothing its just something that struck me this is a good solid little film that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles but is still a really good film to <UNK> up with on your couch br br around 7 out of 10
<START> because <UNK> would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers where do you even begin in a <UNK> of b <UNK> i'm going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie scratch that nearly does not belong in that sentence i can't think of even one character who was portrayed well although in all fairness it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way still the girl who played <UNK> whose name i <UNK> don't include i'm pretending she doesn't exist remains one of the worst actors i've ever seen only <UNK> by the guy who played sebastian the story was god awful it attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways pretty much every part of it was pointless though i will admit <UNK> that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise and the ending was at least slightly humorous but this film is up there with the worst i've seen don't watch it just don't there is absolutely no value in watching it none it only takes away the enjoyment of the first
<START> for the life of me i can't understand the good reviews on this piece of crap it was pointless matthew <UNK> was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man gina <UNK> well others have said it but i'll <UNK> why the stupid accent totally unnecessary and her acting was just bad i don't know if she was thrown by the accent or what there was no chemistry between these two br br and the girl <UNK> was in love with suddenly she's <UNK> half a head of <UNK> in her mouth and acting in a goofy way where did that come from i think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage to a <UNK> begin to <UNK> but frankly i couldn't care less about any of these people
<START> worse than the rating it has been given this is a typical scifi movie nowadays bad to awful acting a script that is poorly written and shoddy direction from the opening scene where demille is <UNK> his set to the end this movie is terrible in the beginning scenes this movie has <UNK> which was charlton heston in the demille film <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> anne <UNK> <UNK> a boy <UNK> a box in the sand the characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to supposedly be the fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an <UNK> the screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no <UNK> in the middle of the desert i was sorely disappointed that <UNK> <UNK> decided to do a film of such low quality
<START> remember ralph bakshi the guy that was an animator on <UNK> then on paramount cartoon studios after that he was a director on fritz the cat 1 2 and heavy traffic well this is <UNK> and it's actually pretty good racist but good the movie takes place in harlem nights no duh it was a working title but with a twist that becomes a lampoon of a disney movie song of the south br br it's about <UNK> barry white and the <UNK> charles <UNK> rush to help their friend randy philip michael thomas escape from prison but are stopped by a <UNK> and wind up in a shootout with the police while waiting for them randy <UNK> <UNK> to fellow <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as he begins to tell randy a story about three guys i used to know just like you and your friends <UNK> story is told in animation set against live action background photos and footage br br brother rabbit voice of thomas brother bear voice of white and preacher fox voice of <UNK> decide to pack up and leave their southern settings after the bank <UNK> their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a <UNK> arriving in harlem rabbit bear and fox find that it isn't all that it's made out to be they encounter a con man named simple <UNK> a phony revolutionary leader who <UNK> to be the cousin of black jesus and that he gives his followers the strength to kill whites in a flashy stage performance in his church <UNK> acts out being <UNK> by symbols of black <UNK> by images of john wayne elvis <UNK> and richard <UNK> before asking his <UNK> for <UNK> br br rabbit first goes up against <UNK> a <UNK> racist and <UNK> white police officer and the bag man for the mafia who demonstrates his contempt for african americans in various ways including a <UNK> to <UNK> before an anticipated encounter with them he believes they're not worth it when <UNK> finds out that rabbit has been taking his <UNK> he and his <UNK> ruby and bobby are led to a nightclub called the <UNK> br br a black stripper <UNK> him while an <UNK> sugar cube is dropped into his drink <UNK> while under the influence of his <UNK> drink is then <UNK> into a sexual <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> gay man and then shoved into clothes that women were representative of the racist <UNK> <UNK> in something racist and finally shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that ruby and bobby are dead br br then while recovering from his <UNK> of being drugged shoots his gun around randomly and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them br br rabbit bear fox and the <UNK> boxer rush out of the boxing <UNK> as it blows up the live action story ends with randy and <UNK> escaping while being shot at by various white cops but managing to make it out alive br br this movie was controversial at that time of release and was re edited by the director several times under the title street fight which is obvious since street fight is a 2005 documentary about racism in the streets in fact this movie has the same subject as the documentary br br that caused <UNK> pictures the <UNK> of this film and the original tobe hopper classic texas chainsaw massacre to go out of business because paramount wanted to produce and <UNK> this film but due to racism <UNK> took over bakshi's production br br despite the controversy it was worth the entertainment the animation was awesome at that time the plot makes sense and it's actually funny too br br final verdict 9 10
<START> i had never heard of this film prior to seeing it i wondered if it was an independent film and i was correct but with a good cast i decided to chance it basically drifter michael williams nicolas cage is in the town red rock <UNK> looking for a job and meeting bar owner wayne brown <UNK> j t walsh he is given a large sum of money mistaken for a hit man he has hired to kill his <UNK> wife suzanne lara flynn boyle he does not correct him takes the money and goes to warn suzanne and after she makes him a <UNK> he decides he needs to leave when wayne knows his real identity he chases michael shooting a big gun until he gets in a car with <UNK> from dallas dennis hopper but things get complicated when michael realises <UNK> is the hit man he was mistaken for and he makes a quick <UNK> he goes back to suzanne and knowing they are both in danger they plan to leave town together and add another <UNK> by falling for each other before they leave however suzanne insists they go and steal a big amount money in the safe of course things aren't going to go smoothly and wayne and <UNK> catch up to them and <UNK> forces them and now tied up wayne to go and get the buried money in the end <UNK> and wayne both get what they deserve michael and suzanne do get on a moving train together but it is obvious she cares more about the money and she gets what she deserves too also starring craig <UNK> as jim vance johnson as mr johnson timothy <UNK> as deputy matt <UNK> dwight <UNK> as truck driver and robert <UNK> as howard the performances apart from maybe a lame boyle are all fine and dandy and it has got quite a good film noir feel for a black comedy thriller very good

<START> two years ago on berlin film festival we watched the <UNK> <UNK> movie sue in the <UNK> program with a wonderful anna <UNK> in the leading part it's a film about loneliness and sex and how the one thing is <UNK> by the other in the same section on the festival now we have to complain the superfluous <UNK> of sue <UNK> du <UNK> de la <UNK> which now tries to convince us that loneliness and having no sex is one and the same problem but unfortunately we can't sympathize with our hero how he is called by the story <UNK> because he is unnecessarily and <UNK> tired of company and himself own fault i'm sorry i can't understand him not enough the writer director actor want us <UNK> to him that it's not his destroyed self consciousness or the <UNK> of his personality what brought him so far but the rotten society and its image of sexuality yes there are some deeper insights about gender relations but we won't follow him so far and the point is that there is rather any sign of reflection about his own portion to the fate having no sex who didn't notice yet it's a quite depressing film br br in the beginning there had been some starts to be more accurate in <UNK> the situation at the bed store the hero speaks about the <UNK> buying a new bed perhaps it's too broad getting up the stairs you have to stay at home half a day this is a satire about a character who doesn't know taking the life and heart in hands doing something the movie <UNK> t follow this path but handles his characters with <UNK> nobody believes that our hero is able to <UNK> <UNK> for a murder too dull too kind too passive not to mention <UNK> complex he has an <UNK> but he couldn't be of course a murderer of women to finish there are women and the world it's not a device of a modern <UNK> society help you as you can but don't follow the messages and the wisdom of this movie which <UNK> <UNK> to human relationships without <UNK> the real conflicts within
<START> i'll tell you a tale of the summer of 1994 a friend and i attended a canada day concert in <UNK> and it was a who's who of the top canadian bands of the age we got there about <UNK> waited in line most of the morning and when the doors opened at <UNK> we were among the first inside the gates we then waited and waited in the hot sun slowly <UNK> but we didn't care because the <UNK> were among our favourites at one point early in the afternoon i sat down and <UNK> off with my back to the <UNK> i was <UNK> to my shock and <UNK> by a <UNK> girl wearing a <UNK> t shirt this is the reason i have hated the <UNK> to this day there's nothing reasonable nor taste determined nor really anything except their <UNK> <UNK> of me isn't it so i in my hatred of the band have denied myself the delight that is whale music br br <UNK> <UNK> had it all it's hard to say what he's lost since he lives in a fantastic mansion <UNK> between the ocean and the mountains the <UNK> region where the movie was shot is breathtaking the life most of us dream of is <UNK> by dreams <UNK> and his own past until the day a <UNK> criminal breaks in and trite as it sounds breaks him out br br canadian cinema suffers from several problems generally a lack of money as well as an <UNK> lack of asking for help as if somehow the feature would <UNK> to be canadian leads to lower production values than american or british films and most people don't like to watch anything that sounds or looks like well not like an american film next canadian screenwriters often seem so caught up in being weird that they lose sight of how to tell a good story and tell it well third they seem to think that gratuitous nudity often full frontal makes something artistic i'm sure anyone who watches enough canadian movies especially late at night on the cbc knows exactly what i'm talking about it's almost like a don't do this <UNK> exists out there somewhere and canadian film makers threw it out a long time ago br br in the 90s and <UNK> however some films such as bruce <UNK> work and the brilliant c r a z y have broken this mold and managed to maintain what makes them canadian while holding onto watchable production values and great stories whale music is such a film on the surface deeper than just its canadian <UNK> it's a deeply moving story of a man who's lost his grip through grief and excess who is redeemed by music then by love and that <UNK> even the <UNK>
<START> i do agree with everything <UNK> has said and i don't always agree with people but what <UNK> has said is very true it is time for the girls to move on to better roles i would like to see them succeed very much as they were a very inspirational pair growing up and i would like to see them grow as people actresses and in their career as well as their personal life so producers please give the girls a chance to develop something that goes off the <UNK> a bit move them into a new direction that <UNK> them <UNK> and their talents in many <UNK> this movie that is being commented is not too bad but as i have seen further on in their movies their movies stay the same of typical plot and <UNK> when in rome is good for audiences of younger generation but the adults who were kids when the twins were babies want to follow the twins in their <UNK> and so hence i think we adults would like to see them make movies of different kinds maybe some that are like the sixth sense the hour <UNK> that sort of movie not saying to have just serious movies for them humour ones too yes but rather see them in different roles to what they have been playing in their more recent movies like this one and new york minute note i am from australia so excuse my weird spelling like <UNK> with the s instead of z
<START> i saw it last night on tv and was quite delighted br br it is sort of the movie which makes you feel nice and warm around heart and believe that there is still some goodness in the world all the <UNK> <UNK> not to see what grace was doing in order to help her and protect her the old policeman is my favourite although you know that this story is not quite realistic br br i loved acting they all seemed just as ordinary common people living in small <UNK> english coast town but the greatest thing in the movie was the wit and humor it has just remember the scene in the shop with two old ladies after they had their tea br br perhaps the ending was a little bit confusing but it didn't stop me from really really enjoying the whole story
<START> when i go out to the video store to rent a flick i usually trust <UNK> views on a film and until this one had never seen a flick rated 7 0 or above on the site i did not enjoy br br sidney lumet a legendary director of some of the best films of the 20th century really <UNK> here by making one of the biggest mistakes a filmmaker can filling a film's cast with thoroughly unlikeable characters with no real redeeming qualities whatsoever br br i like films with flawed characters but no matter how dark someone's personality is we all have a bit of light in there too we're all shades of gray with some darker or <UNK> than others mr lumet crossed this line by filling this movie with totally unsympathetic and almost <UNK> pitch black characters br br ethan <UNK> hank is a 30 something whining immature irresponsible man child divorced from a marriage with a wife that hates him and a daughter who thinks he's a loser which he very much is his <UNK> and <UNK> to let others do the dirty work for him because he's too cowardly to do it himself leads directly to their bank robbery plan falling apart and mother getting killed by the time he stands up to his older brother at the end of the film it's more pathetic than uplifting ethan hawke plays his character well but isn't given much to work with as he is portrayed as someone with a boot <UNK> <UNK> on their face and he <UNK> particularly care that it's there br br speaking of which his character's wife is equally as bad just about every single shot of the film she's in is her <UNK> <UNK> him for rent and child support money and further <UNK> in his already non existent self <UNK> with insults seriously that's just about all the character does her <UNK> like behavior borders on <UNK> br br albert finney plays their father charles and while mr finney has been a great actor for many decades he spends about 90 of this film with the same mouth open half <UNK> on his face like he's suffering from the world's worst bout of <UNK> for someone who's been an actor as long as mr finney you think he'd be more apt at <UNK> even though he doesn't show it much his character is supposedly grief stricken and anger filled and when he <UNK> andy at the film's conclusion it's akin to dr frankenstein putting the monster he helped create out of it's own misery br br marisa tomei isn't given much to do with her character stuck in an unhappy marriage with andy and having an affair with his brother for some <UNK> reason when <UNK> world begins to spiral out of control she <UNK> jumps ship but it really doesn't make her any less selfish or self serving than any other character in the film but probably the one with the most common sense at least br br and finally we come to andy played by the always good philip seymour hoffman is the only reason i rated this film a 3 instead of a 1 his performance of the heroin addicted <UNK> financial executive who's perfect crime of robbing his <UNK> <UNK> jewelry store goes awry is mesmerizing his descent from calm master <UNK> of a flawed scheme to unstable deranged homicidal maniac is believable and tragic <UNK> character ends up being the film's chief villain but it's hard to root against him given the <UNK> are an emotionally <UNK> little brother and a father who's self admitted poor early <UNK> led to his son's eventual <UNK> and <UNK> unintentional murder of his mother br br ultimately this film is really only worth watching for <UNK> great performance and it's family train wreck nature just don't expect there to be any characters worth cheering for because there really aren't
<START> this movie was boring br br yes there are a few funny moments and jokes but you cannot base a whole movie on that br br the characters are too stereotyped there is no real story but short episodes with freaky side characters who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine br br shame because most of the actors are acknowledged in <UNK> a mystery why they took the roles br br this is not a new hope for the hungarian film it was boring though it was meant to be genuine or unique they could have tried much more harder than this 2 out of 10
<START> i can't remember many films where a bumbling idiot of a hero was so funny throughout leslie cheung is such the <UNK> of a hero that he's too dense to be <UNK> by a gorgeous vampire i had the good luck to see it on a big screen and to find a video to watch again and again 9 10

<START> i have watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was that funny but it's still fun to watch and good for a few laughs br br its about women that work at a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine and try to get the respect they deserve br br the acting is really good <UNK> coleman is one of those 80's stars that plays a good bad guy not really evil just unlikeable <UNK> <UNK> is lovable and fun to watch in comedies and her down south wit really shines here jane fonda is so so and does little for me lily <UNK> is the best thing about this movie she has the funniest lines and made me laugh out loud several times gotta love her br br i could recommend this to anyone that likes 80's comedy i like the movie but it has things about it that i don't like it starts off great and has a nice flow and then everything starts coming together all at once and made me care less about the characters they all have little fantasies about what they would like to do the boss and although <UNK> i just thought it <UNK> down the flow of the movie as the movie goes on it once again picks up and the funniest things happen and then once again it slows down only to wrap up in a quick manner thats too good to be true br br 4 out of 10 stars but give it a try if you haven't seen it i think depending on ones mood it may be more or less likable
<START> this movie is a muddled <UNK> mash of clichés from recent cinema there are some promising ideas in there but while the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a <UNK> ambiguous film what he ended up with was a confusing mess lead actor daniel wu does a fair job but with no central theme it seems as though he doesn't have much to work with furthermore the movie is largely devoid of scares although in fairness there are some creepy moments amid the <UNK> br br mild spoilers br br we have the mysterious death of an estranged twin diabolical <UNK> ghostly love interests identity confusion death by savage monkeys <UNK> conflict abusive <UNK> <UNK> homosexuality and crime gang connections the only real <UNK> these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and <UNK> br br perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the dvd cover the act itself is never directly portrayed instead director julian lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys not very scary br br end spoilers br br avoid this one for an excellent psychological ambiguous horror tale check out the korean film a tale of two sisters 2003
<START> this movie was terrible throughout the whole movie i was puzzled and did not see any point to it i had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about this movie is not worth watching at all not only is it sick and revolting but totally stupid please don't watch unless you are one of those that likes to watch bad movies if this movie questions japanese society and their values and roles than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know this is a totally sick movie i did not enjoy it because it made no sense my boyfriend and i sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under it was total disappointment
<START> hollywood's attempt to turn jack <UNK> life into a jack london adventure film isn't a bad idea certainly he led an interesting and sometimes adventurous life this film however winds up flat and unsatisfying most importantly it lacks integrity michael <UNK> as london has some <UNK> speeches and it's nice to see his <UNK> jack receive the call of the wild after spending some quality time alone in the snowy mountains with his dog buck virginia <UNK> and susan <UNK> are both very pretty the film draws unfortunate yellow peril parallels between <UNK> life and world war ii which are both strained and insulting br br jack london 11 24 <UNK> alfred <UNK> michael <UNK> susan <UNK> virginia <UNK>
<START> i didn't know what to expect from the film well now i know this was a truly awful film the screenplay directing and acting were equally bad the story was silly and stupid the director could have made a smart and thought provoking film but he didn't i <UNK> in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad where was the focus to the film where was anything in this film christians should <UNK> this film instead of promoting it it was <UNK> done and a waste of my money do not see this film
<START> this is easily the worst <UNK> scott film <UNK> scott is a wonderful director but this film is a black mark on his career <UNK> moore and viggo <UNK> both totally miscast in an <UNK> film about a girl going to the army very stupid and there is never one scene that is convincing in any way it is really not difficult to make a film such as this everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody the writers didn't have much inspiration either many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all and some brainless action i strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish i hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess
<START> do not see this movie if you value your mind at the end of our collective viewing me and my friends <UNK> that we each lost 5 of our brains during its course the only person involved with its making that was not <UNK> insane was the set designer br br most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth i realize now that instead of a feeling of <UNK> this movie has <UNK> a deep hatred within me i hate this movie so very very much br br some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously if only it didn't take itself seriously but it does the plot is a <UNK> over version of blade runner <UNK> universe <UNK> with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies the dialogue is not only <UNK> and meaningless but often literally painful <UNK> goldberg isn't even trying but george <UNK> as the voice of theodore rex is like <UNK> on the soul and whether its juliet <UNK> with her off again on again british accent or richard <UNK> aka <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> you will sink into an ever increasing sense of <UNK> and <UNK> br br i recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall
<START> this comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail there have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this <UNK> mixture which haven't come anywhere near the depth and <UNK> of this one this is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by <UNK> rogers and ally <UNK> seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film at first the action seems rather off the wall and <UNK> but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and <UNK> trying to <UNK> themselves even if <UNK> through each other <UNK> <UNK> facial expressions of <UNK> hurt and <UNK> angry <UNK> are so <UNK> that one feels them as one <UNK> them you will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it's in doubt and all hangs on a <UNK> emotional thread hopefully audiences will get to see more of <UNK> rogers and ally <UNK> as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt
<START> this adaptation like <UNK> the <UNK> is based on the henry james novel the <UNK> starring olivia de <UNK> remains as a well respected piece of work though less true to <UNK> original story than this new remake which <UNK> <UNK> original title it is the story of a awkward yet loving daughter leigh devoted to her father finney after her mother dies during <UNK> the arrogant father holds his daughter in no <UNK> whatsoever and considers her as well as all women <UNK> when a young man chaplin of good family and little fortune comes <UNK> the father is naturally suspicious but feeling so sure that his daughter could hold no interest for any man is convinced that the young man is a fortune hunter and <UNK> her to see him leigh is a controversial actress  most either love her or hate her  and she always has a particular <UNK> and <UNK> to her style like she's acting through <UNK> teeth she's not bad in this and she handles her role relatively <UNK>  it's just an awkward role for any actress making the audience want to grab the character by her shoulders and shake her until she comes to her senses while the character <UNK> a lot of sympathy she's not particularly likable the very handsome and immensely appealing ben chaplin previously seen in the truth about cats and dogs plays his role with the exact amount of mystery required to keep the audience guessing whether he is after her fortune or is really in love with her maggie smith is one of the finest actresses alive and raises the level of the movie considerably with her portrayal of the well meaning aunt finney is marvelous of course as the father who threatens to <UNK> his daughter for her <UNK> but the daughter is willing to risk that for the man she loves but does her <UNK> <UNK> still want her without her fortune this is only one instance where washington square <UNK> from the <UNK> another instance is the ability to stick with it it is a handsome movie that is as tedious as a dripping <UNK> offering too little story in too long of a movie
<START> i'm a rather pedestrian person with somewhat <UNK> tastes however i occasionally try to raise the bar on my cultural awareness this movie was one of my attempts i was in awe throughout the entire movie i liked it so much that i got my own tape so i could see it again this is a very thoughtful and emotionally striking movie i saw it as a huge question to the viewer what is the depth of sacrifice to duty one can accept can be asked to accept should accept as a military member this is of course an important question to me this question <UNK> heavily on the viewer of this movie br br recommended
<START> if unlike some of the <UNK> here you are not staging a class war and don't mind seeing the lives of other people who are fairly successful <UNK> <UNK> gasp and not being terribly english at a party and getting into all sorts of trouble as a result this is not a bad film closer to euro cinema rather than an imitation of the usual slick american crap i believe the minimal sound design and cheap camera is a conscious decision rather than bad film making i'd defend this the film isn't any worse as a result and it puts the spotlight on the cast some of whom are really good kate <UNK> think that's her name as the sarcastic drunk is spot on the one exception being david <UNK> who should never be allowed to appear in serious stuff it's light and we don't go for this kind of <UNK> of relationship crap in this country but if you don't have any real friends to go to a party with than you could do worse than to sit in and watch this
<START> the <UNK> part was meant to <UNK> back on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name while the labor <UNK> theme tied in with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of the day however despite the a grade b movie cast and some good script ideas the movie <UNK> along for some 73 minutes it's a cheap jack production all the way what's needed to off set the poor production values is some imagination especially from uninspired director sidney <UNK> a few daylight location shots for example would have helped <UNK> the succession of dreary studio sets a stylish <UNK> like anthony mann might have done something with the thick ear material but <UNK> treats it as just another pay day exercise too bad that brian <UNK> typical low key style doesn't work here coming across as merely wooden and <UNK> at the same time cult figure elisha cook jr goes over the top as a wild eyed drunk clearly <UNK> is no actor's director but you've got to hand it to that <UNK> little number beverly garland who treats her role with characteristic <UNK> and dedication too bad she wasn't in charge my advice skip it unless you're into ridiculous bar girls who do nothing else but knock back <UNK> in typical <UNK> <UNK> 50's fashion
<START> sadly 8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter was the last sitcom that john ritter got to work on after his tragic death in 2003 he was one of my all time favourite actors he had it all comedy who can forget him in <UNK> company but he was also an excellent dramatic actor unforgivable  worth watching tv movie as much i loved all the other cast members of the show <UNK> amy <UNK> and martin john was the star he was much of the reason i was drawn to the show in the first place and it was his perfect comedic delivery that was able to crack me up each and every time br br i loved how the show wasn't all <UNK> sweet as much as i loved the <UNK> show come on they were too nice to each other lol they portrayed the typical family dynamics brilliantly it was realistic enough what with all the sibling rivalry and the <UNK> between parents but they still kept it funny a lot of american sitcoms try and fill the shows entirely with morals and what not and this show didn't do that yes there were some like <UNK> important issues such as drugs and bullying but they didn't try and be anything other than a fun family comedy br br the way they wrote john's death in to the show was brilliantly done i still <UNK> like a baby each time i see it you could feel how raw the emotions were during those incredibly hard episodes br br i'm sad the show was cancelled i still enjoy watching the reruns and i never get tired of it br br john ritter you'll always be remembered for you hilarious depiction of this over protective father who would rather lock his daughters up in their room than have them date a boy you rock ritter
<START> the poor dvd video quality is the only reason why i gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 that could have been so much better this movie deserves it br br this is truly a movie that covers several themes simultaneously if you do not like movies about serial killers but are fascinated by the astonishing <UNK> culture in the former <UNK> union this movie is a must see anyway br br i can't compare it to silence of the <UNK> for several reasons the way the serial killer is portrayed has been done far much better in citizen x you see several details of his private life because you travel along with the killer which gives you some idea of the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration br br the only other movie i have seen that is as realistic as this one was henry portrait of a serial killer if you were fascinated by that movie you definitely need to take a look at citizen x
<START> it makes one wonder how this show is still on the air there's been one couple that has stayed together married and has children but everyone else has broken up what's the point of continuing this the show can be entertaining at the beginning you see all the girls <UNK> over one man that almost all of them like instantly it's just like in real life the girls start to take sides bitch one another out and show their true <UNK> or so we think but that one man is left to decide who to pick that he thinks he can marry and live happily ever after br br what is true love exactly how can you fall for someone when you're forced to pick them this show is unbelievable you thought dating online was bad but people have to go on tv to find love it's not realistic how could a girl be with a man when he is going out with several others making out with them none of these questions are answered and finally when the show ends you know there won't be a happy ending in the future for all we know everything is scripted
<START> just another film that exploits gratuitous frontal male nudity awful acting plus the <UNK> scenes are the most un sexy i've ever seen and this is not about me not <UNK> the idea of two young men making love since i'm gay br br again as in <UNK> <UNK> de paz julian <UNK> directed an incredibly pretentious film with a story that makes enough argument for a short film of about five minutes but manages to make a 2 hour film with it and this time there isn't even the issue of racism and <UNK> in the mexican gay community to talk about god <UNK> have mercy on us
<START> just because an event really happened doesn't mean that it will make a good screenplay movie the <UNK> <UNK> by peter bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events which happened on a cruise <UNK> by william randolph <UNK> the writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit the key moments of the story seem implausible for example when <UNK> accidentally shoots the producer believing him to be chaplin <UNK> a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and contrived the story attempts to be a dark comedy but the <UNK> <UNK> misses an important piece of this <UNK> comedy there is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters it hardly matters who is shot who is killed who is guilty and who is innocent there is not a strong character to cheer for as a result the conflicts are difficult to care about and the eventual outcome is incidental
<START> i waited for this movie to come out for a while in canada and when it finally did i was very excited to see it i really enjoyed it of course in the beginning it is a very sad movie and it was new years day making it even <UNK> however it sticks with you the next day i was thinking about it again because although it revolves around something so emotionally <UNK> you realize after a few days that it is such a beautiful story how one person can be seen as the link to so many people but sometimes you can be <UNK> so many things and how diane keaton's character kind of saves the rest of them by just being there and how they save her in the process as well it was such an excellent movie and chris <UNK> one of my favourite actors provides the perfect comic relief it is definitely a movie that will need a box of <UNK> but will really stay with you for a long time
<START> i have seen some bad movies austin powers the spy who <UNK> me batman forever but this film is so awful so boring that i got about half way through and could not bear watching the rest a pity <UNK> talent such as kenneth branagh <UNK> <UNK> and robert duvall and a story by john <UNK> what went wrong branagh is a big time lawyer who has a one night <UNK> with <UNK> her father duvall is a psychopath who <UNK> her cat etc etc so branagh has him sent to a <UNK> and he promptly escapes somehow i couldn't figure out how robert downey jr <UNK> hannah <UNK> <UNK> and tom berenger are all mixed into the story which moves slower than <UNK> i wanted to like this and being a huge <UNK> fan have read all about this movie and i <UNK> expected something interesting this is honestly the worst film i've seen to date and i wish i could have my money <UNK> out of
<START> a family with dad louis <UNK> <UNK> mom rachel denise crosby 10 year old <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and about 3 year old gage <UNK> hughes move to this beautiful house in <UNK> seemingly unaware of the <UNK> that <UNK> down the highway in front of their house every 90 seconds or so the neighbor across the way the wonderful fred <UNK> makes them feel at home and shows them a pet cemetery where children bury their pets but a little further on is a sacred ground which can bring the dead back to life but the dead come back in a nasty mood br br definite spoilers the novel by stephen king was good it was long but it developed characters and situations that made you care what happened this movie <UNK> all the character development and just plays up the gore and violence animals are killed on camera i know it's <UNK> but it's still repulsive a little boy is hit by a semi and his <UNK> pops open during the funeral in a totally sick scene he's brought back to life and attacks and kills people including his mom i do wonder how a 3 year old was able to hang her a ghostly <UNK> don't ask tries to help the family for no reason the movie just works the audience over <UNK> every gruesome death or violence into your face it just goes out of its way to shock you end spoilers br br acting is no help <UNK> is just dreadful as the father he's handsome and buff but totally blank crosby isn't much better the two kids are just annoying only <UNK> single <UNK> saves this picture with his <UNK> good acting br br this picture shows a total contempt for the audience taking large leaps in logic and having characters do incredibly stupid things especially <UNK> at the end this movie was inexplicably a huge box office hit in 1989 which led to the even worse sequel in 1992 i saw it in a theatre back then and was disturbed how the audience kept cheering on the violence and was just appalled by what i saw a sick repulsive horror film a 1 all the way br br when you think it's all over and can't get worse the ramones sing a title song i don't wanna be buried in a pet cemetery truly beyond belief
<START> the movie is about two brothers that are supposed to be alike but are not in any way expect for being smart one is a surgeon and they other is able to write a computer code geniuses as they like to call themselves which sounds very exaggerated if you compare it to personal characteristics can you perceive from the material of the title br br i honestly didn't like the style of the movie i believe that anxiety confusion and deep blues it brings are there for a purpose but what i don't get is why there is so much of it the movie is cheap on scenes and tells the story basically with no human aspect in it at all it gives the comic book like experience however it's visually numbing the viewer it somehow brings him inside the blues with brief dialogs <UNK> scenes dynamic cut music and abrupt noises br br the movie's storyline is very simple most of what's going on is being dramatically <UNK> for long minutes mostly in confusing <UNK> <UNK> effects of drug use and dynamic cuts br br i will say openly that this movie didn't meet my <UNK> a tiny bit
<START> i purchased the dvd set on a recommendation from amazon com based on my other interests they hit the nail on the head with this one i remember watching the show when it was on tv but always wondered what happened to it ten years later it's like watching it all again for the first time lucas black as <UNK> temple and gary cole as sheriff lucas buck are great together even though they are somewhat rivals almost representing good <UNK> and evil <UNK> lucas buck i never really understood exactly what lucas was supposed to be but let it suffice to say he has some special powers that i don't believe were granted by anything holy he can make phones ring writing appear or even cause a person's emotions to change none the less there are a few episodes where he actually becomes the good guy in spite of it all all in all this is an excellent series that like so many others i can think of i e point pleasant <UNK> nowhere man and <UNK> <UNK> just to name a few were cancelled way before their time the steven king's the dead zone <UNK> usa network seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be making it there is just nothing fit to watch on tv anymore this is because anything that deals with christianity and satan is considered offensive and must be immediately pulled from tv so in the meantime i'll just keep buying dvd sets and watching shows that should still be on tv but were <UNK> off tv by religious <UNK> so we could watch quality shows like family guy and american dad and the simpsons what a bunch of crap that is
<START> working from a script written in part by nicholas <UNK> best known for writing the book <UNK> which he adapted into the movie <UNK> and for writing the book and screenplay casino director harold <UNK> shows how connected circles scratch each other's backs even in the command of a <UNK> honorable mayor like <UNK> who is regarded as a presidential <UNK> as cusack follows the paper trail of the dead <UNK> <UNK> report his <UNK> is <UNK> how did this violent young man get <UNK> rather than a jail sentence we meet the other players in the plot not the least of which is danny aiello the political boss of brooklyn and tony <UNK> the mafia boss whose nephew was shot dead how and why these people are <UNK> i leave to the movie to <UNK> though there are never any <UNK> that they are br br the narrative is told generally through the eyes of the cusack character a <UNK> from <UNK> who <UNK> his boss and hopes to learn from him much is made by everyone of <UNK> knowledge passed down through the generations some of the dialogue is <UNK> <UNK> but considering i just described the building <UNK> of the story as <UNK> knowledge one can't say it doesn't work the shooting case builds against the <UNK> of two other issues on the <UNK> desk a charge by aiello for a subway stop and an off <UNK> in brooklyn to aid a new <UNK> center and the city's <UNK> for the next <UNK> convention individual <UNK> are also explored including <UNK> emotional bond with the music of rogers and <UNK> br br much also is made of <UNK> a <UNK> expression which <UNK> explains to his deputy is about the bond of honor between two men about what happens between the two hands in a <UNK> this connection doesn't mean much to bridget fonda the lawyer for the <UNK> association who <UNK> the dead <UNK> honor and fights for his <UNK> <UNK> even as <UNK> evidence appears little by little the deputy mayor comes to grasp that <UNK> is such an influential notion that it <UNK> he law br br there are various scenes of hard impact including one where the brooklyn boss comes home for lunch in the middle of the day his wife <UNK> her interest through the medium of the dish she has <UNK> and then the mafia boss drops in by surprise there is also a compelling and <UNK> <UNK> late scene between the mayor and his deputy br br one scene handled with <UNK> is comprised of the <UNK> decision to speak at the funeral of the <UNK> child in a harlem church his <UNK> tell him he won't be wanted there but he goes anyway and <UNK> himself up for a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> pacino and his character both br br it gets an impressive reaction from the <UNK> but the mayor knows and his deputy knows that it was artificial and the way they <UNK> <UNK> discussing it in the <UNK> taking them away is a subtle <UNK> of <UNK> and innuendo this is a script that knows it has to supply pacino with the reason why most of his fans go to see him and immediately follows its <UNK> with the reality that silence has much more inherent meaning than speech br br pacino and cusack are convincing together throughout the movie the older man <UNK> and aware the younger one anxious to learn but with ideals that don't <UNK> pacino is <UNK> with his down to earth capacity to marry common sense and inventive imagination inspired flair and matter of fact realism cusack moves very <UNK> in spite of his dark <UNK> br br the bridget fonda subplot development is unnecessary but it is a result of veteran screenwriter paul <UNK> otherwise <UNK> <UNK> belief in the worth of every character and each is fleshed into earnest <UNK> aiello for instance is a highlight because he evokes his character's <UNK> de <UNK> and sensitivity to his environment
<START> at least the seats in the theater were comfortable and i ate the pop corn as loud as possible to <UNK> out the inferior dialogue this is absolutely not a girls film any <UNK> who like it are the ones us ladies can be sure to stay far away from dumb story mediocre dialogue and an overall cheap looking film i've seen many many movies but this one is the new winner in the bad category if you do happen to see it the one thing you'll look forward to is the ending so you can finally run out of the theater as fast as you can
<START> after several extremely well ratings to the point of superb i was extremely pleased with the film the film was dark moving the anger the pain the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon br br i had initially expected to see many special effects and like a <UNK> <UNK> it blew me away with the subtlety and the <UNK> of it brian i am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects you will go a long way my friend i will definitely be the president of your fan club br br eric <UNK> the best actor award was the number one choice you made jr lopez look like a child compared to <UNK> br br overall the acting story line the high quality filming and awesome effects it was fantastic i just wish it were longer i am looking forward to the <UNK> with extremely high expectations
<START> if there's one genre that i've never been a fan of it's the biopic always misleading filled with false information over <UNK> scenes and <UNK> all around <UNK> are almost never done right even in the hands of the truly talented directors like martin scorsese the <UNK> and ron howard a beautiful mind they often do a great <UNK> to the people they are trying to capture on screen <UNK> takes the place of hype with the majority of <UNK> that make their way to the big screen and the notorious bettie page was no different some critics and <UNK> <UNK> to gretchen mol given the role of bettie page saying she was no longer a celebrity and didn't have the chops for the part i never <UNK> mol could handle the part since but i never expected to as blown as away by her performance as i was upon just viewing the film hours ago mol delivers a <UNK> oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950's pin up girl who after an early life of abuse depicted subtlety and <UNK> done something few directors would probably do inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time the picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story director co writer marry harron and <UNK> <UNK> fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending still credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it <UNK> masterfully come oscar time mol turner and harron should be receiving nominations doubt it will happen though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them 9 10
<START> if this movie should be <UNK> it should be the <UNK> of hazzard to sum it up this movie is nothing but <UNK> minutes of two immature country <UNK> <UNK> the famed 1968 dodge <UNK> around town and in the country chasing the girls and <UNK> the law br br i have been a fan of the dukes and what <UNK> the movie is the characters are out of key the <UNK> of profanity sexual references and drug use has made the good name of the dukes into trailer trash br br side from comparing it to the television show the acting was horrible the only actor that got it right was the famed 1969 dodge <UNK> named general lee the others have exaggerated the character's role which <UNK> the movie br br the dukes have been another <UNK> of the 21 st century hollywood television to big screen transition tragedy skip this movie and just buy the television series on dvd br br my grade f
<START> this movie really i mean really sucks its got plot holes so big and 30 foot dragon can fit through them not to mention the dragon itself which is inevitably the worst computer generated image ever to be put on the film real i mean when you see something like this you gotta be thinking wow someone actually made this movie then released it that takes guts whoever they are i'm sure they don't work in the film business anymore br br when i hired this movie it wasn't in on dvd so i reluctantly took it out on video the first thing to appear was a lord of the rings trailer for the two towers this was a very clever move putting this trailer on the video it <UNK> me reluctantly giving the film 1 star otherwise i would have given it zero stars maybe the producers though the star attraction of dean cain i think thats how you spell it would draw in the crowds uh to the video store that is br br next they employed split screen technique like in hulk to i assume compensate for what an atrocity this piece of crap film is on the box cover we see a picture of our hero and the dragon does the dragon look exactly like the one in <UNK> or is it just me either way the dragon in the film looks like a reject from <UNK> 2 and has the cgi of a <UNK> video game villain from the early 90's perhaps worse also not the dragons movement as it <UNK> its victims its the same f <UNK> monotonous movement right leg left leg right leg left leg dom dom dom dom dom dom f king <UNK> this just <UNK> me off maybe the filmmakers thought this was thrilling and would have the same effect of jaws why not then have a dragon <UNK> shot either way that was just funny much like watching a <UNK> <UNK> br br dean cain gives many puzzled looks during the film maybe his coming to terms with the fact that this film could end his career don't expect superman here the first time i saw the trailer for this film i thought it was an add for a <UNK> game br br as for the story its so so bad my 5 year old brother can come up with better ones when he's <UNK> trying to lie about why he was messing around in my room while i wasn't there oh and did i mention that i f king hate the people who made this incredibly stupid stupid crap atrocious film
<START> well how do you even rate a movie such as this one does it even have cinematic value really it's a movie that tries to get as close to being a snuff movie as possible basically the entire movie is purely a bunch of guys torturing a young girl not very appealing and on top of that also not that realistic really br br it's obvious that the movie tried to be as realistic and shocking as possible however the movie is just all too fake for that to work out as intended the <UNK> and <UNK> is all soft and fake looking as well as sounding they are often just kicking into the floor rather than into the girl obviously also the way the girl responds to all the <UNK> is pretty tame i mean if this was real surely she would had screamed it out there is more <UNK> than screaming in this one though br br the movie is obviously low budget and it's a <UNK> attempt at trying to achieve something shocking and realistic as well as original and provoking with very limited resources don't really think this movie made much impact though at the time it got released though it must had done something well since a total of six sequels got released after this one br br fans of shock and gore will most likely be disappointed by this movie though there are still some fetish people out there who will get a kick out of this movie br br 4 10
<START> enormous fun for both adults and children this film works on numerous levels there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good yet subtle jokes for adults br br glenn close is at her <UNK> evil best as cruella call me <UNK> de <UNK> br br after three years in dr <UNK> behaviour <UNK> clinic she is <UNK> of her desire for fur  even the puppy skin fur she had so intensely desired she even has all of her fur <UNK> placed in the <UNK> of the extraordinary castle she <UNK> br br but it wouldn't be a <UNK> movie without the <UNK> and <UNK> of cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour <UNK> and now she needs one extra puppy hence <UNK> <UNK> to complete her <UNK> scheme this time round br br <UNK> <UNK> is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the second <UNK> dog shelter though he was in <UNK> and in last year's television version as <UNK> of great <UNK> i didn't recognize him well he was <UNK> officer <UNK> in <UNK> and i didn't see great <UNK> so i am not terribly surprised br br gerard depardieu does a delightful turn as the <UNK> <UNK> of cruella he <UNK> and <UNK> in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen  and does it well his <UNK> witch of the <UNK> homage is hilarious br br tim <UNK> is superb is <UNK> not so evil henchman  he was also <UNK> ' <UNK> butler in 101 <UNK> and you may also recognize him from all of the black <UNK> brit <UNK> he plays his usual bumbling good hearted somewhat dim witted character to great effect br br oscars for <UNK> are generally given for the entirety of the <UNK> in a film this is unfortunate as the clothing worn by glenn close is amazing  it is incredibly detailed note her <UNK> when she is being released from the behaviour <UNK> clinic and worthy of such an over the top character her clothing alone deserves at least an oscar nomination br br animation holds a special place in my heart  but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing <UNK> to <UNK> it can't be done suffice it to say that <UNK> <UNK> is even better than the film version of 101 <UNK> that came out in 1996 there is a lot to like here from the sight gags the dialogue and the costumes to the casting it is a good film for the whole family
<START> poor michael madsen he must be kicking himself to know folks have found out about this horrible flick i really can't think of anything worse i have ever seen except amateur porn it's that bad and all here wooden acting bad script crappy moral ending you hate it and it is in this movie br br my question is who the hell put into this piece of <UNK> doo at least we could have seen michael's sister virginia nude in a scene but i don't think even that would save this stinker br br for a cool guy that has made some exception movies i want to know what wacky church <UNK> this piece of <UNK>
<START> i went in to this movie thinking it was going to be the next <UNK> but left feeling let down the humor was weak and the characters fairly flat that isn't to say it was all bad the idea of the dating service in the <UNK> store seemed like pretty <UNK> material but the director switched focus to the <UNK> save the mom and pop store from the evil corporation guy i felt like if he would have just stuck with the dating service plot he would have come out with a much more memorable movie now to do the film justice i am from the rochester area and loved the way he portrayed <UNK> in fact the best kevin smith of <UNK> homage here was giving props to his hometown <UNK> ny is to <UNK> what red bank <UNK> is to <UNK> the director wisely threw in a date at nick <UNK> trust me as far as things to do in rochester a garbage plate is at the top of the list i was lucky enough to see this film at the little in rochester so everybody knew when the <UNK> to the town came up and appreciated them
<START> im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when i'm picking a film so i picked five across the eyes i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish i think i could of done better myself i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch i think it was a little bit like a <UNK> rip of off the <UNK> which project and it has not worked at all it was foul
<START> if you want to see women's breasts get a porno there is no plot but the last 45 minutes of this movie focus on <UNK> some sort of dangerous plan the only value this movie has is that sometimes its so bad its funny and yes boobs are boobs
<START> one thing that <UNK> me about this film and not in a good way was that nathan <UNK> who seems to pride himself on being the major <UNK> on the topic of the rosenstrasse was one of the historians working on this film considering how much of the actual events were altered or <UNK> br br another reviewer said that von <UNK> said she never meant for lena to bed <UNK> but in that case why did she give every impression that that was what had happened why not show other possible reasons for the <UNK> release such as the disaster that was <UNK> or the <UNK> fear that the international press based in berlin would find out about the protest br br also why did the whole storyline play second <UNK> to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history in places it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common br br overall this film failed in its aim which was to draw attention to a little known act of resistance which is a shame because done better it could have had a major impact
<START> when it comes down to fairy tales cinderella was the one that made you cry the most poor cinderella is a girl who had her whole life stolen by 2 evil and ugly <UNK> and a slave driving step mother and thanks to mr walt disney we got to witness cinderella in animation br br before the story begins cinderella and her father are lonely and rich beyond their needs to share his wealth and to give his daughter some sisters <UNK> dad marries a woman but then dies soon after the stepmother only seeing dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her gorgeous step daughter cinderella br br so for many days cinderella is a slave to her step mother and her step sisters she has hope however thanks to her friends the mice of the home sounds like cinderella wasn't playing with a full deck she has hope that one day she'll find her prince the chance eventually comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend br br 9 10
<START> quite typical for swedish movies of this type strange that the acting was <UNK> bad these actors usually give a good show the casting was poorly done it made you expect something i won't tell you what the lead character was awful i don't know where they find her anyway stay away from this and go see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> instead this is swedish action in is prime
<START> carry on <UNK> was released in 1972 and it's becoming clear that the series has reached a natural end with the best entries like <UNK> up the <UNK> and screaming being from the mid to late 60s br br in itself <UNK> is by no means bad it's just that we've seen it all before with a thin plot a bunch of <UNK> trying to break into a hospital to steal a supply of <UNK> <UNK> which they plan to sell to third world countries surrounded by gags of a slightly amusing though <UNK> nature i think that's where the problem lies the gags aren't all that amusing with the <UNK> nature starting to show its age did we need another movie that uses a man dressed up as a woman in order to drive the plot perhaps the worst criticism i can make is that i saw carry on <UNK> this afternoon less that twelve hours ago and i have a problem in trying to remember a very funny line that's a serious problem for a comedy
<START> <UNK> image <UNK> and others produce films for the sci fi channel that come in with budgets of roughly 2 million some feature extensive effects work others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both for 2 million br br mr hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at 20 million dollars but it's painfully obvious that this was probably produced for <UNK> 000 if not considerably less than that few sets are <UNK> a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem <UNK> and amateurish br br it's painful to watch not so much because it is poorly directed poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget br br those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the <UNK> of those spoken of by p t <UNK>
<START> hi br br i heard about lost from a co worker that had obvious differences of opinion on entertainment he loved it well i watched an episode or 2 in the early seasons and was bored so i tuned it out after a few years i stumbled upon lost bored with the current sci fi fare wow was i surprised can you say gravity well damn i got sucked in the pace and scripting are very good some of the flash forward backs are so so with the <UNK> characters but over all good my favorite characters are ben locke <UNK> richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> daniel <UNK> <UNK> wife walt charlie <UNK> and jack's dad jack and michael definitely are immature <UNK> very spoiled and immature kate 1 step above them juliet was way more classy than kate mr <UNK> way under rated and on the level of charlie if not more too bad they both died the guy dressed in black talking to <UNK> way back is a genuine curiosity as a whole great very layered series looking for more br br regards
<START> the movie begins a with mentally challenged girl with bright yellow <UNK> looking <UNK> on a <UNK> street corner and being <UNK> by a passing plane the movie <UNK> the life of five <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> anita <UNK> have completely different lives and choices of shoes their shoes is the first superficial yet <UNK> with some <UNK> meaning clue we get at their fragile identities in a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> way a <UNK> tries to <UNK> reveal the deepest secrets of a woman's souls by the sole of her feet the premise is <UNK> and slightly contrived but the tone and depth of the movie takes a daring <UNK> for the good br br what may have been light hearted and superficial quickly switches gear with the a superb dysfunctional couple scene that leaves the viewer <UNK> for minutes seeing the love or lack thereof the pain the confusion the hope the needs and escape <UNK> develop through minutes different rooms of the house and down to the street and eventually below what a scene but there will be others as effective to follow and <UNK> the strong characterization and directing displayed in this slice of life affair br br moving along a woman has lost the husband she loved and inherited his kids and his taxi while another has completely lost her husband emotionally sexually intellectually but not physically a ghost a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> regret <UNK> a new love can you love a <UNK> can you love the person in the mirror can you love someone you can't love or think you can't love can you love and live life even though it will always be somewhat hopeless yet isn't it exactly these hopes and dreams that keep us here grounded and in a spectrum of relative happiness a lot of deep themes emerge and the final act brings people and ideas together to <UNK> in an existential crisis with no clear cut solution definitive decision or effective healing maybe a <UNK> thought a fleeting feeling but a lasting appreciation of life and of the artistry and intellect of the film live live again <UNK> the reel <UNK> the real the important the big stones <UNK> of life the rest is just details
<START> this movie is by far the <UNK> i have seen in a long time wonderful animation and adorable characters even the bad guys were cute made this one a total winner in my book and also in the books of those i saw it with i still want to see it again but haven't had time better than toy story which was good too but not this good
<START> not having read <UNK> and knowing nothing about chess i could only view the luzhin <UNK> as a movie br br it works really well as one of my favorite genres sports romances the chess comes alive as a tough competition much more than in say searching for bobby <UNK> in showing just how much hard mental work the game can be <UNK> thought <UNK> <UNK> and planning i particularly liked the special effects on the chess board as alternative plays are anticipated br br through the feminist director maureen <UNK> of <UNK> emily watson with her big blue eyes gradually <UNK> via her <UNK> relationship with john <UNK> fairly one note absent minded intense chess genius br br the settings in italy and <UNK> are beautiful br br originally written 5 27 2001
<START> this is a fan made short film that pretends to be a preview for a new movie that <UNK> batman and superman it's the sort of film that fans adore and watch at places like <UNK> and was made by the same person who made batman dead end sandy <UNK> br br as far as this film goes i could easily pick it apart sure the cgi effects aren't perfect and the costumes are far from perfect but this was made on a <UNK> budget and for a fan film this is incredible i was particularly impressed by the very buff superman he was no <UNK> little guy if only this were a preview for a real film they'd have fans <UNK> up from here to <UNK> to see it great job
<START> despite its budget limitations this is a great film proof that effort and imagination can overcome lack of cash the opening in which cave paintings seem to show how some dinosaurs at least survived into the age of human beings is a nice red <UNK> after that a meteor comes down into a lake and causes heat which in turn causes the <UNK> of a frozen dinosaur egg maybe the cave paintings suggest instead that this isn't the first time such a thing has happened when the <UNK> beast appears it's a well animated <UNK> which is soon causing <UNK> in the local area alright so it's not jurassic park but it's still genuine entertainment for fans of monster movies
<START> one of the <UNK> <UNK> i've ever played the levels are creative there are fluid controls and good graphics for its time there's also a <UNK> of crazy bosses and enemies to fight sometimes the levels get frustrating and if you leave out some of the hard levels and still need to get more accomplished to fight a boss it can be annoying another complaint is the camera angle though it works fairly well most of the time it can be a pain in certain situations if your a big time mario fan this ones for you even if your not a huge fan of him i'd still recommend this one its a big game and getting what you need can take a while but it's very satisfying good for playing in short bursts of time it will almost certainly hold your interest it sure does hold mine
<START> now this show looks like most of the other shows of it's type from the mid 90's but the only thing is about this one is that it's different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too i personally thought it was a good show i can't understand why would they <UNK> it the good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since 1997 up to date br br my hopes is that the wb bring back the show or even do a movie which i know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesn't hurt to dream doesn't it br br anyway i would recommend if you hadn't seen it to find the dvd of all 13 episodes because the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great
<START> this is simply the most astonishing movie you will ever see i thought it was just another documentary but it really is something else it doesn't try to teach you anything it shows you how life works in nature br br i won't talk about the quality of the pictures because you obviously know from other comments it is <UNK> br br earth is funny tense and sad it can make you laugh it can make you cry sometimes both at the same time this is the first movie that made me cry not because you feel sorry for the animals but because you come to realise how fragile our planet is and what treasure we were blessed with yet we don't appreciate it one bit br br this movie should be shown obligatory in schools it is the most wonderful film you will ever see so go and see it who knows maybe it is the last time we might see our planet like this br br 10 10 but i would easily rate it more if it were possible
<START> now i love american pie 1 and 2 while 3 was great just for <UNK> william scott's performance as <UNK> but after that the quality has dropped band camp kept the standard reasonably high with characters you actually cared about but naked mile was the same joke and plot lines recycled <UNK> <UNK> sex problem is like <UNK> it had some amusing moments like the football game against the <UNK> and the <UNK> of <UNK> but on the whole it lacked originality and the <UNK> was just stupid and moronic not to mention the irritating girlfriend who doesn't want to have sex br br anyway enough about the naked mile i watched <UNK> house with <UNK> as i thought it could take the series to a new low but i was pleasantly surprised to be honest there is no real plot but it's filled with hot girls ashley is incredible and sex jokes <UNK> yes it is formulaic and the jokes are old but dwight <UNK> steve <UNK> raises the bar with an <UNK> performance the greek <UNK> is entertaining especially the <UNK> and final events while christopher <UNK> cameo is hilarious there are weak points though <UNK> is as irritating as he was in the first i'm still <UNK> to as how he ever got a part br br while <UNK> is bad <UNK> <UNK> is worse john white made naked mile a pain to watch but in <UNK> house he takes his performance to a whole new low first and foremost he lacks charisma a <UNK> <UNK> you really can't care less about him the only reason i was bothered about his relationship was so ashley could be on screen she shines above him as does the rest of the cast seriously john white is the ultimate in bad acting and has about as much charisma as a dead fish br br saying that the film does entertain and <UNK> fear that his girl is not exactly a girl is brilliantly funny br br overall this film is worth renting get a few of your mates in and have a laugh at the vomit fest event and <UNK> your anger at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i was up late flipping cable channels one night and ran into this movie from about 10 minutes into the start every time i even thought going to bed something kept on telling me to keep on watching it even though it was way way way past my <UNK> br br this movie could have been another easy slam <UNK> anti gun film but instead they chose to examine the <UNK> of the shootings and even better the movie kept on with the real life just when you think they are going to take the easy and obviously contrived way out a twist comes along and changes the whole <UNK> of the movie this film not only doesn't follow the formula it shows how other events often lead up to and or affect what happens afterwards br br i only wish the filmmakers had explored the issues around anti <UNK> drugs more the kids from <UNK> who did the shootings were on them for years and it was frightening to watch the way deanna popped them every time the nightmares started up until recently they were <UNK> the stuff like candy and only now do they even begin to understand what long term effects the drugs have it was very refreshing to see that the mental illness aspect of the story was given quite a bit of film having a relative who suffers from a mental illness i can say that the movie was dead nuts on in every aspect of mental <UNK> bravo to the director and writer who obviously did their <UNK> on those issues and for those who think certain things couldn't happen in a hospital i don't want to tell any <UNK> you're dead wrong on that too i've been there the script was so real it was amazing br br go buy this film and show it to your teenage kids before it's too late someday they'll thank you for it
<START> this is a bad bad movie i'm an actual <UNK> trust me when i say that this film's <UNK> of accuracy is just that this is especially true during that vile little scene when the <UNK> are combining <UNK> with 80's pop the ending is predictable and the movie is a bore from start to finish horrible
<START> <UNK> <UNK> was exceptional but <UNK> <UNK> comes too late we already have enough of this and we want something new br br big directors should have no problems seeing beyond their time not behind why people see romania only as a <UNK> country br br we are just born not <UNK> and nobody gives a s t anymore about old times most people dont remember or dont want to remember and the new generation of movie <UNK> dont understand a bit this should be the first day of romanian movie not the final song <UNK> maybe younger directors should make the move
<START> i found this family film to be pleasant and enjoyable even though i am not a child it is based on the concept of a high school girl susan elisha <UNK> discovering that the elevator in her upper class apartment building becomes a time machine when a key on a key chain she got from a blind scientist is turned in the elevator lock she learns how to control the machine with some <UNK> about time of day br br the film is not a work of serious science fiction you have to ignore the usual <UNK> <UNK> associated with <UNK> the past through time travel i e the past is changed to prevent the <UNK> walker family from becoming poor but the change means the family never got into financial trouble so victoria wouldn't have told susan about the financial problems her mother had which means that susan shouldn't have had a reason to change the past in the first place but other than that there are some nice touches in the story such as the old elevator <UNK> found in the apartment of the woman who secretly invented and <UNK> the time machine not having a space for the lock that <UNK> the time machine feature as in many stories for children we need to also suppose that a child will not share startling information about a time travel device with a parent or other adult but instead hide the time <UNK> br br it also requires <UNK> some poorly staged scenes and uninspired performances by some of the adult actors the child actors elisha <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and matthew <UNK> all were very convincing in their parts in one scene in the <UNK> native americans notice susan <UNK> and <UNK> them but they don't register surprise in the sudden appearance of this blond white skinned girl in peculiar dress their response is to simply stop what they are doing and to walk <UNK> towards susan in the same scene an indian mother is carrying what is supposed to be a baby but is so obviously a doll its white skinned and its head <UNK> around br br timothy <UNK> the award winning actor who originally came to fame in tv's old thirty something gives a somewhat uninteresting sometimes <UNK> performance in the other extreme michel <UNK> <UNK> it up as the italian building <UNK> janitor as does richard <UNK> in his role as a <UNK> neighbor the <UNK> name is edward <UNK> which is the name of the author of the novel the film is based on i suspect that these problems may be the fault either of the director or possible of a low budget br br despite these flaws i recommend the movie for kids in addition to the interesting story it also has some educational value in that it points out how much both technology and social <UNK> have changed in little more that 100 years
<START> i found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible br br the only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was <UNK> <UNK> performance who i thought played the multiple personalities really well for me she was definitely the highlight of this movie br br <UNK> meyer was pretty as always but i found her role pretty bland so i don't think one can say that her acting was great br br as for the male lead <UNK> <UNK> his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese 1980s hospital series br br all of that i could have lived with however the terrible terrible terrible end solution the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing i have seen in a long time
<START> finally an indie film that actually delivers some great scares i see most horror films that come out theatrical straight to dvd cable etc and most of them suck a few are watchable even fewer are actually good dark remains is one of the good ones i caught a screening of this film at the south <UNK> island film festival the audience loved it and my wife and i loved it having no name actors i assume the budget on this film was pretty low but you wouldn't know it the film looks fantastic the acting totally works for the film the story is good and the scares are great while most filmmakers focus solely on the scares they often forget about story and character development two things that help to deliver the scares more <UNK> brian <UNK> <UNK> must know that character and story are important he develops both to the point where you care about the characters you know the characters and are therefore more scared when they are in danger br br watching horror films that cost anywhere from 80 million to <UNK> to make i find dark remains to be one of the gems out there check this film out
<START> this movie was just plain bad just about every cop movie cliché is present and <UNK> for bad guy gets away check partner check wacky personality clash with partner check rookie with something to prove check rookie shows up <UNK> veteran check about the only ones it didn't touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and <UNK> but i guess they're saving those old <UNK> for <UNK> next outing add in the battle of the <UNK> with girl power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like <UNK> prize car getting <UNK> all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie avoid this one at all costs
<START> the last hunt is one of the few westerns ever made to deal with buffalo hunting both as a sport and business and as a method of winning the <UNK> indian wars before the white man set foot on the other side of the <UNK> the <UNK> used to have <UNK> of american <UNK> as large as some of our largest cities by the time of the period the last hunt is set in the buffalo had been all but wiped out the 20th century due to the efforts of <UNK> saw a revival in population of the species but not hardly like it once was br br robert taylor and stewart granger are co starring in a second film together and this one is far superior to all the brothers were <UNK> here stewart granger is the good guy a world weary buffalo hunter who has to go back to a job he hates because of financial <UNK> br br the partner he's chosen to throw in with is robert taylor forgetting taylor for the moment i doubt if there's ever been a <UNK> <UNK> soul than charlie <UNK> who taylor portrays in devil's <UNK> he was an american indian fighting against the prejudice <UNK> up by a racist played by louis <UNK> in the last hunt he's the racist here he kills both buffalo and indians for pure pleasure he kills one indian family when they steal his <UNK> and takes the widow of one captive like some barbarian <UNK> he expects the pleasure of debra <UNK> sexual <UNK> he's actually mad when <UNK> doesn't see it that way br br no matter how often they refer to russ <UNK> as a <UNK> i was never really convinced he was any part indian it's the only weakness i found in the last hunt br br however lloyd nolan the <UNK> old buffalo <UNK> taylor and granger bring along is just great nolan steals every scene he's in with the cast br br for those who like their westerns real who want to see a side of robert taylor never seen on screen and who don't like cheap <UNK> the last hunt is the ideal hunt
<START> i always wondered what happened with that magic kind of feeling the old <UNK> movies seemed to have in them well in time i wondered if that feeling was just the nostalgia or did that feeling decide to pack its <UNK> and say goodbye somewhere in the middle of our cinematic history and then never came back or did it because for me it came back the first time i saw <UNK> <UNK> and it was it's old self again br br there are three qualities of this movie that makes it somewhat unique and as enjoying as it is to watch the smooth flow of the story the warmth of the colors and what i appreciated the most the lack of excessive use of verbal communication something many of other not just <UNK> screenwriters should at least consider there is no use for words when you can understand each other just as well yeah or better by other means in use just watch <UNK> and <UNK> uh br br so this in only so many words is why i would recommend <UNK> <UNK> to all of you as a must see <UNK> movie regardless of what you may heard of <UNK> films if you ever even heard anything that is br br oh and that scene where <UNK> is dancing to <UNK> music a treat br br treat yourself watch it
<START> there's a lot of movies that have set release dates only to get pulled from distribution due to a legal <UNK> of some kind and then put in <UNK> for a long time you can only wish a film as rotten as <UNK> remained in a coma for what it's worth which is <UNK> release dates were continually <UNK> around for this truly awful movie that is so much a <UNK> on the radar like it deserves the premise kicks off under the <UNK> of ethan a creepy nerd with a scary obsession for the campus <UNK> angela ethan <UNK> <UNK> the aid of david and his friends who have been <UNK> the school for their entire run with blackmail to help win angela i don't like to give spoilers out but for a piece of crap like this i can make an exception angela falls for david ethan intentionally <UNK> everything up the good guys win that's what happens in a nutshell for another tired <UNK> of the teen gross out genre gross humor is funny it always has been dating back to the days of the immortal classic animal house to the likes of <UNK> like there's something about mary and road trip amongst dozens of others of which there are too many to mention but when you use it as a plot point you can only get so far case in point ethan has an angela doll composed of her individual <UNK> of hair of which he does god knows what with it no one wants to take witness to watch ethan <UNK> in the shower while singing to himself no one wants to watch a young man singing she'll be coming around the mountain with a <UNK> on his penis but nothing can prepare you for the full visual assault of seeing 50's <UNK> <UNK> van <UNK> bare her breasts at <UNK> years old i don't know if it's the story's lack of <UNK> which cuts to scenes that make absolutely no sense director <UNK> <UNK> was a former fashion photographer and after reviewing this film you can only wish he'll go back to the profession the worst thing you can do on any film is to make it look like you're having fun because you detract from your <UNK> just like <UNK> does by <UNK> it's plot outline under a pile of gross out gags pointless vignettes and lack of construction it's like a bunch of college students got drunk took one's camcorder and shot a bunch of random crap and <UNK> it together if you want to see a teen gross out comedy that's actually good then i suggest american pie and animal house or road trip just something that's entertaining and not dreadfully bad like <UNK> <UNK> cameron diaz makes a cameo in this film just as she did in another bad film such as the <UNK> thing where the story treats gross humor like another plot instead of a device much like this disaster if you pass by <UNK> at your local video store just keep on walking and let it end up at the bottom of the shelf like it deserves
<START> i thought this was a truly awful film i found myself actually yelling at my tv a couple times one or both of the gay male leads was miscast there was absolutely no chemistry between them and richard <UNK> looked like he'd rather be kissing a dog the movie covers their long and tortured <UNK> <UNK> each break up and make up but not developing the reasons in between in any detail these reasons would make for some interesting characters not the fight or the make up scene in bed lame even if you liked the movie br br <UNK> martin and adam goldberg shine as their characters but it doesn't make the film worth renting save your money
<START> apparently shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is at one point in this film someone i believe <UNK> producer warns him that film is getting off track that it was once about how the masses think about shakespeare through the vehicle of richard iii instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments <UNK> throughout some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for al was there really any reason for the quick visit to shakespeare's <UNK> other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there and before the film has really even begun we are treated to seeing al <UNK> around and act cute and funny for the camera i thought his silly act with kay near the end of godfather iii with the knife to his throat was an act but apparently it's how al really behaves in person br br enough rambling here's a shotgun <UNK> of why i didn't even make it 3 4 of the way through this 1 pretentious al always knows when the camera is on him whether he's acting as richard or in a <UNK> conversation with someone you can see it in the corner of his eyes also some of the actors around the rehearsal table become <UNK> and wax hammy to the extreme if anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside it's unbearable look at me chewing all the scenery 2 <UNK> <UNK> when she appears as lady anne this film comes to a <UNK> halt which it never <UNK> from she has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera <UNK> on her to bring in the <UNK> her performance is dreadful to boot 3 the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very <UNK> the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture of course you also learn that pacino shouldn't be directing films or doing richard in the first place i'd rather watch bobby <UNK> than this br br lastly read the play and learn it for yourself go out and see it performed in 1997 i saw the play performed at the university of washington ethnic cultural theater and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama except for the gratuitous throat <UNK> of clarence my god was that necessary br br it's all just a bunch of sound and fury <UNK> <UNK>
<START> ask the dust looked intriguing from the trailer and we especially like all of the actors unfortunately the movie was not compelling enough to be considered drama and it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy it practically seemed to <UNK> itself and to no entertaining effect after <UNK> minutes of waiting for this thing to get better my wife and i walked out <UNK> not having wasted any more time on such nonsense it simply was not interesting moving funny nor artistic it appears as though it were written produced and directed by a high school kid worse yet it was such a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actors not to mention our time and money
<START> i often feel like scrooge <UNK> movies that others are raving about or i write the review to balance <UNK> <UNK> i found this movie almost unwatchable and unusual for me was fast <UNK> not only through dull clichéd dialog but even dull clichéd musical numbers whatever originality exists in this film unusual domestic setting for a musical lots of fantasy some animation is more than <UNK> by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought provoking plot development <UNK> june <UNK> and dan <UNK> appear to be nice people but can't carry a movie as a team neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal they're both bland i like billy gray but his character is pretty one note the best part of the film to me are june <UNK> beautiful costumes and great body
<START> alfred <UNK> is not my favorite director by any means but imagine what he could have done with this the plot holds much potential for suspense john garfield is as almost always excellent and raymond massey is <UNK> cast against type nancy coleman is not a very impressive leading lady but the supporting cast is large and very capable br br yes it starts to <UNK> fairly early there are too many <UNK> and an important subject is <UNK> by its being made into little more in the end than a love story br br it's fun to watch for garfield massey and the character performers but it's not awfully good
<START> around the late 1970's animator don <UNK> frustrated with the <UNK> his company disney was <UNK> <UNK> from the mouse house to form his own studio his first production the secret of <UNK> was a brilliant feature that still holds up well to this day this was followed by an american tail and the land before time both of which were made under the involvement of steven spielberg and were <UNK> successful although none of those two films had the dark adult appeal of <UNK> they still are very charming enjoyable features for both children and grown ups but before long don <UNK> had his first major misfire with all dogs go to heaven critics were especially harsh on this film and matters weren't helped by the fact that it opened alongside disney's the little mermaid br br considering that the movie has such a friendly sounding title one would expect all dogs go to heaven to be pleasant family fare instead <UNK> provides a surprisingly dark story involving gambling <UNK> crime <UNK> and murder that itself is not a problem for an animated feature per say but it does call into question over whether the film is for children on the other hand it's hard to say whether adults will find much to enjoy in all dogs go to heaven in short it's a movie with a major identity crisis br br set in a dreary <UNK> of new orleans the movie starts out when charlie b <UNK> a rough and <UNK> german shepherd is run over by a car courtesy of his former gambling casino partner a nasty <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> carface before you know it charlie finds himself in heaven albeit by <UNK> here a <UNK> angel <UNK> tells him that all dogs go to heaven because unlike people dogs are usually loyal and kind this line represents the confused nature of the movie since the dogs in the movie the <UNK> aside are presented as anything but br br upon realizing that he's been murdered charlie steals his way back to earth and plots to get even with carface with the reluctant help of his <UNK> pal itchy charlie <UNK> <UNK> prize <UNK> a human girl who can talk to animals in order to predict who will win the rat races charlie claims that he will help the little <UNK> find her a family but in reality he is using her skills to win <UNK> at the race so that he can build a more elaborate casino of his own to bring carface down although he refuses to admit it charlie does grow to love <UNK> br br the concept of the story isn't as <UNK> as the execution aside from the human girl <UNK> and a flamboyant musical alligator who appears about three quarters through with the vocal <UNK> of ken page none of the other characters emerge as likable nor frankly are even worth caring about unfortunately that also applies to charlie in trying to make him an anti hero the script composed by more than ten writers only succeeds in rendering the character too <UNK> as such the audience feels no empathy for charlie and worse his redemption at the end of the movie does not come across as convincing further <UNK> to the character is the <UNK> <UNK> vocal performance from burt reynolds besides the lack of an endearing lead the movie's other problem is in the structure of the story the slowly paced plot jumps all over the place and makes a habit of throwing in extra scenes which serve no purpose but to pad out the movie's running time the aforementioned musical alligator who <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with native rats seems to have been thrown in from nowhere as does a scene where charlie tries to show his <UNK> to <UNK> by feeding a pack of <UNK> colored <UNK> pizza the whole screenplay feels like a rough first draft a bit more polish could have made this a <UNK> <UNK> story br br matters are not helped by the lackluster musical numbers by charlie <UNK> and t j <UNK> <UNK> song and the <UNK> <UNK> are the only good ones the latter in particular benefits from ken <UNK> <UNK> vocal or the uneven voice cast as mentioned burt <UNK> stiff and lifeless charlie <UNK> from his already unlikeable character even further the only exception is a fiery confession to itchy about his true intentions toward the end dom <UNK> as itchy is pretty good but he's had better roles notably tiger in an american tail and jeremy in the secret of <UNK> ken page as mentioned is awesome in anything he does but his character has such a small part that his overall contribution is <UNK> at best similarly wasted are <UNK> anderson as a <UNK> who once <UNK> a <UNK> with charlie <UNK> moore and charles nelson <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> is probably the only voice that comes across as truly memorable partially because her character is the sole <UNK> likable one in this depressing and <UNK> show br br <UNK> aside the only real positive about all dogs go to heaven is the animation technically this film has some of the most imaginative visuals from <UNK> team by 1980's standards that is particularly a frightening scene where charlie has a nightmare about ending up in a fiery underworld ruled by a <UNK> satanic <UNK> demon if anything the movie is more of a triumph of animation than storytelling br br on the whole however i cannot recommend all dogs go to heaven as good entertainment even though i recognize that the movie has its fans and the climax does <UNK> provide some energy and a moving conclusion the overall package is not in the same league as <UNK> better efforts animation buffs will marvel at the lush artistry but by the time it's over all dogs go to heaven could very well leave a bad taste in your mouth
<START> this movie has a very hard to swallow premise even by this <UNK> standards we are asked to accept not only that a record played backwards can bring a dead man back to life but that the record also contains hidden messages aimed specifically at one kid when the singer had no connection to the boy when he was alive and of course no way of knowing at whose hands the record would end up anyway the film is fun for a while but eventually the silliness and the <UNK> reign supreme if they were really trying to create a new freddy like horror icon they were way off the villain here has no personality no motivation and no variety 1 2
<START> while the story of a troubled kid turning to boxing for self respect and anger management is hardly a new thing the story is given a fresh twist here when the protagonist is a girl instead of a boy br br diana has trouble at school she just can't stay away from fighting at home her father is constantly putting her down her brother trains boxing at a gym and one day when she picks him up she decides she also wants to train br br it would be easy to call this movie a rocky with girls i guess but that is not at all what this is about the story actually benefits very much from the main character being a girl rather than a boy that way you can deal with more problems at once first the problem of her not being accepted because she's not a <UNK> girl and then when she comes to the boxing gym because she's a girl at all it's also a story about how a purpose can change <UNK> life how positive things can make you grow i don't want this to sound pretentious because the movie doesn't feel pretentious at all but what i'm saying is true br br also michelle rodriguez is very good in the lead it's a shame really that she has become stuck in the tough girl <UNK> now because that's really not what her part in <UNK> is all about sure she's a female boxer but rather it's the more sensitive moments that really makes her shine br br so maybe this is basically your average underdog story with a twist but it's lifted way above the crowd by <UNK> performance i rate this 7 10
<START> i must say i was impressed the cinematography was amazing the frames close to perfection and the way he built up the tension around a subject that sound more like a dreadful bore is beyond be br br the film is about two <UNK> one seen one unseen they are both trying to explain the significant of a series of painting that caused a scandal a long time back the film is all about theories and explanations of views but the conclusion is quite shocking i must say definitely a film that deserves more than it's <UNK> votes br br with only <UNK> minutes to play out it's plot the film still felt like a complete work fantastic direction i must say far better than blood of the poet which it for some strange reason remind me a bit of br br i suppose you can call it by the <UNK> word artsy it's pretty much just a lot of professional talk about various theories and stunning visual effects but the crew and <UNK> did pull it off at least for me an amazing film
<START> no this wasn't one of the ten worst films of the 1980's but it certainly <UNK> the bottom 100 somewhere this movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981 how else would you explain special effects pre dating an american werewolf in london disco still being considered cool and ronald reagan not being the <UNK> president of the united states while we're at it let's not overlook those 1970's <UNK> in the 1950's and <UNK> i've seen more of that here than in happy days <UNK> shirley combined br br the one woman who <UNK> this movie to the so bad it's good category was the late great elizabeth <UNK> but just barely <UNK> plays as miss <UNK> the <UNK> high school teacher who becomes a <UNK> a stereotype that's been done to death and is still being <UNK> out by hollywood today but even as a hot chick she <UNK> her <UNK> qualities her call for help is evidence of this she also looks much better as miss <UNK> seven bucks at the beauty <UNK> shot to hell she wasn't kidding br br this isn't to say that there aren't any good parts elsewhere they're just few and far between and i'm not just saying that because i like <UNK> incidentally teen wolf was better than this teen wolf too was better than this and that wasn't even so good br br
<START> scary movie 2 is a let down to the scary movie franchise scary movie 1 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great scary movies br br this film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape br br this movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things it is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the scary movie franchise then give this a watch but i don't think you will like it nearly as much
<START> i read the novel <UNK> <UNK> for the first time back in 1986 it was round that time that i saw the bbc version with timothy dalton and zelah clarke it was an excellent version and very much like the book years later i laid eyes on this version and was horrified william hurt is totally miscast as mr rochester mr rochester is a passionate character where as william hurt portrays him as a block of ice the same goes for charlotte <UNK> it was like watching two zombies together this is story about love and passion but i couldn't see it in this version no back to the bbc version a wonderful time is guaranteed
<START> if you've seen other movies like this they're probably better the <UNK> man comes to mind to the <UNK> credit they avoided the <UNK> unnecessary big budget <UNK> that <UNK> movies of this <UNK> additionally the set up and premise were excellent four people whose past is virtually irrelevant to us are trying to get away from an overwhelming <UNK> fatal disease what's bad is everything else i get tired of endlessly stupid <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> arrogant characters in a movie that pretty much describes everyone in the movie at some point i rented it and found myself yelling at the tv repeatedly no don't do that why are you so stupid look out <UNK> a true lack of character development is evident about halfway in a movie should give you a strong personal connection with at least some of the characters so that you actually care what happens to them this one does not also there should have been a longer more involving end to the movie as well
<START> this movie is a crappy and forgettable sean connery vehicle the performances are generally crappy especially by <UNK> fishburne and the usually solid ed harris connery seems miscast as a <UNK> academic the movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along it is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it <UNK> the movie <UNK> an excellent supporting cast george <UNK> also turns up in a minor role to add some <UNK> to connery as they debate the death penalty the violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mystery thriller that is manipulation to the highest degree the scripting and direction are extremely poor <UNK> charisma and screen presence are the film's only virtue manipulative violent and ridiculous 2 10 avoid it
<START> i usually start by <UNK> the premise of the film but before anyone makes any <UNK> <UNK> about my review let me <UNK> it by saying that i'm someone who likes most films just check my other reviews alone in the dark is a film by director uwe boll whose film right before this one was house of the dead 2003 like alone in the dark it was also a film adaptation of a video game almost everyone hated it well i loved it i even gave it a 10 out of 10 my point in stating this which will surely turn some readers off immediately is that if even i hated alone in the dark there must be something wrong with it br br the premise who am i kidding attempting to state a premise for this film is about as easy as trying to balance the united <UNK> budget but here it goes anyway some <UNK> discovered evidence of some lost american indian tribe the indian tribe apparently had discovered some means of <UNK> the second world which was evil in nature the bad stuff wiped them out but not before they could lock the door to the evil world and throw away the key later some scientist government <UNK> who had been <UNK> with the <UNK> and specifically this tribe decided to experiment on some kids to try to produce some kind of hybrid with the second world believe it or not everything up to this point and then some is told to us in a written prologue to the film it's just white text <UNK> across a black screen with a voice over also reading it to us then there was something about the kids being in an <UNK> but the government takes them back out and then a bunch of people are searching for <UNK> <UNK> and there are super humans <UNK> around and a bunch of military people are called in and on and on br br in fact the exposition never really stops it's like a <UNK> <UNK> from hell there are enough ideas here to fill at least 10 films maybe 25 but not one of them is presented in a coherent way to create one good film in addition to the mystical lost indian tribe and the <UNK> we also get monsters that resemble a cross between alien and a werewolf worms that <UNK> your body and turn into snake like aliens <UNK> worms underground zombies starship <UNK> like wars evil scientists underground <UNK> gold mines spooky <UNK> <UNK> big mostly <UNK> <UNK> government <UNK> golden <UNK> pulled out of the sea nuns explosions complex <UNK> plots a very ambiguous romance car chases home <UNK> kitchen sinks wait i can't remember if that last one was in the film even more amazingly <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> producer shawn <UNK> was <UNK> as saying we're spending much more time on story being very <UNK> about that tara reid called alone in the dark a smarter film br br let me not <UNK> anyone a lot of that stuff above might sound <UNK> to the potential audience for this film but the problem is that nothing has the slightest connection to anything else i usually had no idea what any <UNK> relation was to any other setting why we were there or what anyone was doing at least when each scene began it's just a random <UNK> of settings and clichés as if director uwe boll had 250 unrelated ideas in a hat and pulled them out like <UNK> numbers then when he was done he and editor richard <UNK> decided to cut the film by using <UNK> then <UNK> it by throwing the i <UNK> sometimes the film plays like an extended director's reel which is a combination of short varied unrelated scenes that directors <UNK> to try to get work but perhaps that's being too generous i'm not sure boll would get work if this were his reel br br just as i tend to at least like most films i tend to like most actors and most performances it's very rare that i say that a performance was bad well tara reid was bad here and i'm someone who usually likes reid i don't know what happened for a large <UNK> of the film they just move her around the set like a prop they might as well have just bought a blow up doll that would have saved them money that they could have used for some cgi ghosts and vampires in castle and graveyard settings maybe they chose to move her around like a pretty piece of <UNK> after they saw the <UNK> of her <UNK> nonsense dialogue in a <UNK> that's usually reserved for entertaining mother in laws br br and speaking of that dialogue a lot of alone in the dark plays like a godzilla film without godzilla by that i mean that it's a lot of pseudo scientific <UNK> <UNK> at least in godzilla films there's a <UNK> to it because they know how ridiculous it is and there's a big payoff in that we get to see godzilla destroy downtown and battle a giant <UNK> with <UNK> death <UNK> shooting from its eyes or something br br just what stephen <UNK> and christian slater are doing here besides overacting and <UNK> <UNK> against their agents is difficult to say i can't say that i thought anyone in the film had a decent performance although maybe slater at least saw the <UNK> i think that's <UNK> for me br br still i didn't give this film a 1 there was some competent cinematography even if boll and <UNK> made <UNK> out of it and the hard rock tunes over the end credits were good heck even the <UNK> prologue wasn't so bad i actually thought the film had promise at that point but this may just be the worst film i've ever seen with a budget of 20 million or more
<START> if you ever hear these three words <UNK> to you joe don baker be afraid br br final justice is the low budget action movie based on a sheriff in a texas town named <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> he's an ugly slimy rude character who is on the hunt for a criminal in <UNK> who killed his partner in texas his partner actually <UNK> down twice in the movie very bad editing joe don baker <UNK> ends up in jail like 4 or 5 times in this movie making the plot go nowhere fast plus he shoots everybody like he's in the wild west i guess nobody told him it was the 20th century a woman cop is assigned to show him around <UNK> who looks like <UNK> from seinfeld and she is the only one who can put up with the redneck she must be insane br br the <UNK> in the bar are the most entertaining characters in this movie their dancing is shown throughout the film and i began to bond with the sleazy women well at least it was better than watching <UNK> try to dumb his way out of something the ending is flawed and somewhat predictable and i was happy it was finally over you'll never forget that last line of joe don baker from the movie br br it's so hard to imagine how he was in three bond movies very weird anyway if you're up for a laugh then see this one on mst3k sometime also i've heard his other bad movie among many mitchell mst3k version is being released on dvd by <UNK> i can't wait to see that
<START> weak stale tired cliched wants to be basic instinct but misses opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspectives new insights insipid trite grotesque and without the possibly redeeming value of <UNK> oh wait it was only 90 minutes long it must have just seemed a lot longer i'd rather clean bus station <UNK> with my <UNK> than have to sit through this again i'm expressing an opinion here i guess this means i didn't like it
<START> well worth watching especially with the nice twist of a journalist with integrity you are expecting a big fall down story line as grey owl is <UNK> as a fraud but it is not to be and adds to the generally optimistic and uplifting theme and drama of the story and film br br this has to be <UNK> best performance to date he convinces admirably as the english boy playing indians the stand out scene is the return to his aunts where brosnan and the two elderly lady actresses make a wonderful scene full of feeling of nostalgia and a life lost with so little dialogue just with expressions and good direction perfect br br the story is so little known and the message so universal and all important it is a real pity this film did not get better recognition maybe in time it may become a bit of a classic and a sleeper i hope so br br well done <UNK> attenborough and cast
<START> <UNK> is truly a masterpiece it's a thought provoking film that makes you think and makes you question our culture it is without a doubt the best hindi movie i have seen to date this film should have been shown at movie festivals around the world and i believe would have been a serious <UNK> at cannes all the characters were perfectly cast and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were haunting in their roles br br the story the movie tells about <UNK> is a very very important story and one that should never be forgotten br br it has no <UNK> or prejudices and has given the <UNK> a human story here no one country is depicted as good or bad there are evil indians evil <UNK> and good indians and <UNK> the cinematography is excellent and the music is <UNK> meaningful and haunting everything about the movie was amazing and the acting just took my breath away all were perfectly cast
<START> what can i say about it it's another hollywood's horror flick with very high budget 80 million dollars not scary at all it offers us only a few thrills and one really creepy sequence with <UNK> in the <UNK> a lot of computer generated special effects and nothing more catherine zeta jones is beautiful as always <UNK> taylor is also a good actress the architecture of the hill house is amazing all these <UNK> <UNK> furniture delicious however i don't like the ending because it was so <UNK> check this one out and form your own opinion on it i give this picture 7 out of 10
<START> this review applies for the cut of the film that's generally available as fury of the <UNK> i understand there is an uncut version out there with additional footage and i would hope that it contained at least eight or nine crucial scenes that seem to be missing from the cut known as fury of the <UNK> in short the movie makes absolutely no sense whatsoever it is utter nonsense and incomprehensible nonsense at that br br <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> portrayed by paul naschy in a seemingly endless series of films is apparently a normal guy who has just come back from a trip to <UNK> where he was attacked by a yeti somehow this has turned him into a werewolf <UNK> is a doctor a scientist and an <UNK> at what appears to be a college one of his female colleagues <UNK> <UNK> is involved in a vague form of <UNK> <UNK> a nonsense word used to refer to a bunch of <UNK> attached to a <UNK> head <UNK> feels this will <UNK> her to change the direction of the human brain naturally <UNK> her to rule the world provided she can get us all attached to those <UNK> with no trouble br br <UNK> is also into werewolves because she kidnaps <UNK> and takes him to her hidden laboratory she has a bunch of other people trapped there as well some of them look like <UNK> and are <UNK> up being in varying states of <UNK> others are clearly hippies <UNK> feels that one day she may be able to help them be human again but in the meantime she controls them with her <UNK> <UNK> becomes her hairy hit man wandering around like a werewolf zombie that is until the filmmakers decide to use footage spliced in from another naschy werewolf film <UNK> bloody terror don't ask at which point <UNK> werewolf makeup changes considerably and he <UNK> around like an animal br br is this making any sense no good that's the film's saving grace it doesn't try and engage you on any kind of intellectual level it just goes full speed ahead with whatever nonsense dialogue or cheap horror movie sets it can <UNK> up fury of the <UNK> may be the best halloween party movie ever you absolutely do not need to pay attention to it and in fact if you do you will be completely confused
<START> i really love the sexy action and sci fi films of the sixties and its because of the <UNK> that appeared in them they found the <UNK> women to be in these films and it didn't matter if they could act remember candy the reason i was disappointed by this film was because it wasn't nostalgic enough the story here has a european sci fi film called <UNK> being made and the director is fired so the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker jeremy davies to complete the picture they're is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays <UNK> but she's barely in it film is written and directed by roman coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script i wish the film could have been an homage to those early films they could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them there is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its john phillip law <UNK> gerard depardieu <UNK> <UNK> and dean <UNK> appear as well i guess i'm going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties if any are reading this make it as sexy as you can i'll be waiting
<START> prom night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely <UNK> a lifetime original film you know the one this october lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving insert disease name here to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex boyfriend it's dramatic  it's sappy  it's immensely dull it does nothing to further a genre tell an original story or <UNK> for any sort of <UNK> prom night shares this plight watching the killer poke holes in his victims we sit <UNK> as they <UNK> to the floor with not a drop of blood <UNK> it occurred to me that this was the <UNK> killer in movie history br br our director is working with a fairly good looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear <UNK> think about matthew <UNK> coming at you with a knife you'd probably go  oh good <UNK> guy is going to kill me <UNK> not scary even for a second so the director throws <UNK> into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror this mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator you'll get 15 jump scares in this film 2 of which made my date jump i might mention she is afraid of everything i'd also mention she decided to take a <UNK> halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me br br as if this film were not disjointed enough it appears to be cut to <UNK> i'm not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew <UNK> to salvage some semblance of a horror film i'm saying as the film moves from scene to scene you often get a jarring jump this is the kind of thing you'd expect when a film catches fire and a <UNK> is forced to <UNK> ends together cross his fingers and hope for the best the editor should be shot br br with a plot you can pack into two sentences one stray <UNK> of blood an <UNK> killer and the tension of a very special episode of silver <UNK> we're left with no reason to support horror this weekend  at least on the big screen in fact this is the sort of film that should be <UNK> is it really that hard to make a scary movie was this crew even aware they were making a horror film a complete waste of my time and yours i bit the bullet to get you this review don't let my sacrifice be in vain don't go into the movie
<START> this is a collection of documentaries that last 11 minutes 9 seconds and 1 frame from artists all over the world the documentaries are varied and deal with all sorts of concepts the only thing being shared is 9 11 as a theme very minor in some cases some of the <UNK> are weak while others are very strong some are political some are not some are solely about 9 11 some simply use 9 11 as a theme to touch on human feelings emotions and <UNK> that are universal some are mainstream while others are abstract and artistic this film has not been <UNK> in any fashion by anyone so the thoughts that you see are very raw and powerful br br this is a very controversial film especially for conservative americans i think two segments might really <UNK> off the right <UNK> one from egypt where a dead american soldier and a dead palestinian <UNK> come back as spirits another from uk which <UNK> the us backed <UNK> of <UNK> on <UNK> 11 1973 which resulted in 50 000 deaths and horrible atrocities the segment from mexico was the most powerful <UNK> the fall of the towers and the resulting death in vivid fashion you have to see it to believe it br br even though the final product is uneven with some segments being almost pointless i still recommend this it's very difficult to rank this film because the segments <UNK> all over the place some weak some very powerful i'm giving this a rating of 9 out of 10 simply because some segments were excellent and covered issues that usually get <UNK> mexico segment uk segment japan segment egypt segment
<START> many people have commented that this movie was nowhere near as good as the first well maybe it isn't to you however how does your child react to it well mine loved it more than the first br br disney movies of the past can sometimes be a little harsh for little kids for example <UNK> mother getting shot this movie was really great for my sensitive little girl who likes humor and happy endings br br if you want to be <UNK> about what should be disney's standards based on the past skip this movie br br if you have a sweet little girl or soft hearted little boy you really want to please buy this movie and treat your small children this film is great as a <UNK> movie for happy dreams instead of nightmares i'm happy with a movie that <UNK> my kid doesn't need to impress the parents all the time
<START> sometimes a movie is so <UNK> awful it has a destructive effect on your <UNK> you begin to really ask yourself what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low can they honestly expect that we'll endure this many clichés and still be entertained br br of course it is still a hollywood <UNK> to make the gun the major character plot device and the source of all conflict and resolution in films character needs a gun gets a gun can't do that because he has a gun puts his gun down first oh my god what are we going to do he has a gun he waves it around acting more <UNK> than real human beings ever do he pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes shouting questions the hallmark of any conclusion will be the <UNK> sound of police <UNK> br br it's a real challenge to make such a tired hackneyed formula work again a film has to be very clever and well executed this one is neither it has no life and no personality and it will suck these <UNK> from you it will make you feel worse about living in the time and space that you do really who needs that so yes i'll say it i think this may well be the worst film i have ever seen anyone who was involved in the making of this sub mediocre soul killing trash should be <UNK> embarrassed for the <UNK> they've done to us all
<START> the 1st season was amazing the whole idea of them <UNK> to the island while mysteries were being explored and seen was just phenomenal filled with suspense tons of <UNK> and an amazing plot i mean i love the whole idea of just seeing them get used to the island and then first seeing the smoke monster in the first episode really caught my attention from then on i was hooked the second season was right on par with the 1st season only a little better i absolutely loved the idea of the <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> the whole plot and sequences of season 2 were mysterious creepy and exciting i loved all the suspense surround others on the island but the <UNK> story really made season 2 amazing br br season 3 wasn't quite as good as 1 and 2 but nonetheless great i loved seeing the back stories of the others seeing their camp and seeing the mysteries further explored <UNK> <UNK> is dead is one of my favorite episodes this season while not as good was still breathtaking and fun but most of all exciting now the 4th season i had hopes for this season and the 1st couple of episodes we're good but then it really started to get boring and monotonous i mean i really despise the new <UNK> such as miles and daniel the plot got old after the first couple episodes and most of all season 4 was stripped away of something which made lost a perfect series the mystery suspense comedy mixed in charlie gone and overall excitement also some of my favorite characters have left
<START> the acting in this movie was superb but mixed with the truth about the condition of many <UNK> in south africa made it heart wrenching it was good that the writer isolated <UNK> and lena from others run from their homes so we could share fully in their <UNK> and <UNK> the conflicts they shared as they grew together and apart worth seeing when you put the movie in it's proper context
<START> we have an average family <UNK> a famous <UNK> we have the <UNK> teenage daughter the adopted white kid and the cute little kid and we have <UNK> <UNK> what show has had a <UNK> like that do we have a messed up brady bunch <UNK> when it first came out i thought it was really cool mostly because i was young the music was bad the <UNK> were so bad and they were too g rated all of his <UNK> were about his family and friends and problems the dad was kind of the danny from full house type of dad always gave the advice out but he wasn't a clean freak they had a house keeper for that remember the plots were basically <UNK> romeo was in trouble of some sort or not that's it oh and maybe some <UNK> drama yeah that stuff is good not really but its still a good show for kids but <UNK> could do better
<START> the <UNK> highlight of this movie is peter <UNK> performance in turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic does anybody do it better than o'toole i don't think so what a great face that man has br br the story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts especially toward the end but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels however i felt the film basically <UNK> around peter <UNK> <UNK> performance and i'm sure i wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it
<START> i just saw <UNK> yesterday and i was really <UNK> despite all the oscar buzz this is nothing special anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics except for eddie murphy's great musical and dramatic performance <UNK> is just a <UNK> tv movie with no style or flair just a bunch of amateurs singing at each other br br now the first half hour was good but i was irritated at how eddie murphy's terrific <UNK> performances were <UNK> and interrupted by montages those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film and the rise to the top portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum the remaining hour and 45 minutes was a <UNK> rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting it was also visually dull and included too many sound alike tunes br br <UNK> didn't try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as i'd expected they would each number in the 2nd half was just one <UNK> after another of people singing at each other and the way they shot <UNK> big love me number was criminal <UNK> just shot her <UNK> around the stage no drama at all god it sucked br br and note to all involved that sing talking dialog stuff might work on stage but it does not work in movies see embarrassing failures of <UNK> and phantom all that i'll <UNK> <UNK> something <UNK> <UNK> crap should have been left on the editing room floor those aren't songs br br again the film except for eddie murphy's amazing performance was nothing more than a <UNK> tv movie there must have been <UNK> behind the <UNK> work for this film i wonder how much money was spent to give it that pre release one to beat oscar buzz as a whole this film was except for eddie nowhere near an oscar caliber movie except for eddie i'd rank it right up there with grease 2 big disappointment especially after all the very <UNK> i've hype
<START> i must admit that this is the type of film that i would normally <UNK> but i rented it basically because of the stars i certainly was not sorry in fact as you see i rated it five stars this film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and superior acting br br andy and hank <UNK> are brothers who decide to commit the <UNK> crime of robbing their parents' jewelry store the crime goes terribly wrong thus beginning an examination of the three men in the <UNK> family through a series of flashbacks we get to know charles <UNK> and come to an understanding of the strained relationship between father and sons br br younger brother hank is basically a screw up he has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind hank is insecure cowardly and very much under the influence of his big brother ethan hawke has the character of hank nailed to a t and gives what is probably his best performance thus far he shows us a man who is basically good hearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task br br andy on the surface appears to be a successful businessman but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been <UNK> from his company to pay for his habit it is andy who <UNK> the scheme to rob his parents' store and he gets weak <UNK> hank to commit the act philip seymour hoffman surely one of the finest actors of our time plays andy hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who on the surface is a charming businessman liked by his <UNK> but a real <UNK> ball underneath he is absolutely perfect for the part of andy or it might be said that he through his superior acting skills made andy the perfect part br br albert finney plays a father common to his generation charles <UNK> is not a bad or <UNK> man but he has a lousy relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was necessary in <UNK> a positive bond between his sons and himself he has always been too quick to criticize and <UNK> he always made it clear that he <UNK> his younger son over his older thus causing a wide emotional <UNK> between himself and andy as we get to know charles and andy the thought of andy <UNK> a plan to rob from his father becomes less unbelievable br br on a personal note i cannot believe how much charles <UNK> reminded me of my own father and how much andy and hank reminded me of my own brother and myself perhaps this may be one of the reasons that i enjoyed the film so much as this story of a distant critical father a more successful older brother and a less successful younger brother hit so close to home fortunately my brother and i never came to the state of committing a crime against my parents guess we were made of <UNK> and more moral stuff br br this complex of personalities and actions has been expertly put together by director sidney lumet at <UNK> three he still has the chops to give the audience engrossing characters and edge of seat action that <UNK> 12 angry men was his first film made fifty years prior to before the devil knows you're dead but he hasn't lost any bit of his magic touch in showing us characters that will be long remembered br br the events and characters in before the devil knows you're dead are harsh and unattractive and this is definitely not a feel good movie however it is two hours of ultimate entertainment which i thoroughly recommend
<START> mario is invited to princess <UNK> castle for cake when mario gets there he finds out that <UNK> has kidnapped her mario must save the day again unlike the 2 d games mario can explore anything he wants to he can just <UNK> around climb trees trying to look for 1 ups find secrets in levels and more you can spend four hours in one level no time limits there are 16 worlds with a number of stages and there are star doors which you need a certain number of stars to get into once you get in these star doors you must go through a stage and fight <UNK> at the end of the stage to get to certain worlds you need a number of stars to get in you enter the world by going through a painting there is so much stuff to do and so many hours of <UNK> i don't see how anyone could dislike this game it's great this launch title is the game that <UNK> <UNK> that the <UNK> would have a good life every 3d <UNK> form game we know of has something in common with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are examples that are <UNK> used super mario 64 is one of the greatest games in the history of 3d games 10 out of 10 if you have an <UNK> buy this game it's hard to find used because no one's selling this baby for 5 bucks at the <UNK> shop a perfect 10
<START> hitler the rise of evil was <UNK> in controversy before it ever aired and that controversy may obscure the accomplishment of the film br br those who <UNK> the film which they hadn't seen did so with good intentions based on the misguided thought that it would be overly sympathetic to hitler however they misunderstood the point to <UNK> the evil hitler is not sympathize with him it is far more disturbing to realize that the <UNK> acts committed by one of <UNK> greatest villains were committed by a human being a sick <UNK> maniac to be sure but a human being nonetheless it is necessary to know the story of how hitler was able to come to power to prevent it from happening again br br rise of evil is <UNK> by a brilliant career best performance from robert <UNK> who makes hitler a human being without ever redeeming him in any way <UNK> <UNK> captures the look and mannerisms of the nazi leader while never letting the <UNK> become cartoonish or distance us something anthony hopkins was not quite able to accomplish when he portrayed hitler in the <UNK> another very good made for television film while were are <UNK> by hitler's <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gives him a certain <UNK> and power the real <UNK> hitler must have <UNK> after all while else would a nation have followed him br br of the various subplots by far the most compelling features matthew <UNK> as reporter fritz <UNK> who makes it his life's work to draw attention to the reality of of hitler and <UNK> while <UNK> performance is a little stilted in part 1 by part 2 he seems to have settled in the character gives us a real life hero in a film full of villains peter <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> also give strong support br br part 1 of this two part mini series suffered a little bit from being overly choppy including a look at hitler's childhood which lasts only the duration of the opening credits and in part 2 sections <UNK> hitler's <UNK> with his niece and his mistress eva <UNK> are less successful than the central plot but do serve to give us further insight into his mental and emotional state br br ultimately no film about hitler can make us understand him the average person is thankfully incapable of ever understanding a man who would try to <UNK> an entire race of people hitler the rise of evil tries less to make us understand hitler and more to make us understand how he came to be power it is an important story that must be told and it is impossible to believe anyone who has seen the film would <UNK> it of having anything but the best of intentions and the <UNK> of doing anything but good br br 9 out of 10 1 2
<START> i am writing this after just seeing the perfect son at the 2002 gay and lesbian <UNK> <UNK> film festival in sydney australia br br when their father dies two estranged brothers meet at the funeral and after discovering that one of the brothers is dying from aids they enter on a heart warming journey of <UNK> the two leads do a magnificent job of creating the <UNK> warmth and respect that builds up between them as the movie progresses i do have one <UNK> about the movie though whilst the brother who is dying acts sick he doesn't look it a person of 0 <UNK> cells would look quite ill not even a make up job to make the actor look ill was employed a small <UNK> but one that makes it a bit less realistic despite that one small <UNK> the perfect son is a wonderful movie and should you have the chance to see it do i'm hoping for a dvd release in the near future
<START> what surprised me most about this film was the sheer audience it attracted similar films such as anita and me have never caused as much hype as this film has though i think that's probably because of the mention of <UNK> in the title more than anything else br br it's a brilliant film putting across a brilliant message you can do anything if you're determined enough and put your mind to it which is such a positive message to anyone watching this film br br i think this is one of <UNK> <UNK> better films and i think she's a brilliant actress and was excellent for the role <UNK> <UNK> was brilliant too sadly i can't say this for jonathan rhys meyers because i don't think that he was that much of a good actor and to be honest his eyes were a little scary br br all in all a brilliant film and a brilliant story
<START> all i can say is first movie this season that got my attention i picked it because of the actors gere and claire and the story looked promising i have just watched it and i can say i'm overwhelmed there are shocking scenes true but that's what makes it more realistic we shouldn't run away from our reality these things are happening right this moment and there are experts who are trying to change things and make things better and who get laughed out about their commitment to the cause actually i can't seem to feel the hollywood touch in the movie and that's what makes it better both claire and richard did a great roles and deserve a 10 from me
<START> i myself am a big fan of low budget 80's horror films this isn't the worst but still not to spectacular the plot line is decent but drags out way too long you're through half the movie before you even get to see any zombie action the kills aren't very creative and the zombies aren't too <UNK> i truly think this movie would have been better if they left out the zombies and just made it into some mafia flick it's watchable but i feel that this film did steal at least an hour of my life i'll give the film credit for being somewhat original if you are really into b horror movies it's worth a viewing but if you're not don't bother but you don't have to take my word for it
<START> page 3 is one of those films <UNK> <UNK> makes to expose societal filth the film is compelling but like most of <UNK> films it is one sided and overly <UNK> this film is all about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> celebrities the film exposes the lives of <UNK> whose lifestyle is <UNK> <UNK> peculiar and repulsive they party they care for nothing but fame they plan parties at <UNK> they are <UNK> for more money and a higher reputation they will do anything to get due exposure in the media to get their names <UNK> <UNK> on the daily <UNK> social <UNK> known as page 3 with huge photographs which will be the center of people's discussions they are attention seeking <UNK> and <UNK> the film industry is shown as sleazy with casting couch being a common phenomenon among filmmakers that's where our lovely heroine a young social <UNK> reporter <UNK> <UNK> is thrown all these people from <UNK> elite depend on her <UNK> and she is the right person to <UNK> at these parties if you want her to mention you in her article later in the film we learn that even those who are <UNK> friends are no different from these high society people this was tough viewing for me although the film is <UNK> brave and the issues it deals with are interesting br br the film's music is average the only passable songs are <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> e ala sung by the two melody queens <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> respectively otherwise the soundtrack is bad one song which was particularly horrendous is <UNK> very <UNK> the film's writing is quite good the second half is far better than the first as it turns more matter of fact and exposes much more important issues such as terrorism and child abuse that's where the film has to be <UNK> it was sad to know that people prefer to ignore such crimes out of fear and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character's disappointment was very easy to relate to she was excellent throughout the film and her acting in the last few scenes was particularly impressive <UNK> <UNK> part was very small but he did full justice to it <UNK> <UNK> is solid as the <UNK> editor <UNK> <UNK> is lovable as <UNK> sassy roommate pearl who marries an older man for money and is honest enough to admit it the film's ending is really well done and provides a certain sigh of relief after the <UNK> tough proceedings page 3 is a good film it is interesting and at times moving but the level of its interest and its general quality are marred by its exaggerated overly messy and negative portrayal of the rich and famous
<START> the basic hook here is lincoln is slow it is his <UNK> that represents his <UNK> and <UNK> making him a great leader who is here engaged in single <UNK> <UNK> the american frontier through the grand <UNK> of law all that john ford <UNK> and more including one lurking slave and <UNK> death by <UNK> however the <UNK> <UNK> is also at the center of one brilliant piece of movie making funny and moving at extremes the history may be <UNK> but the telling of it suggests a view of history as process that <UNK> some <UNK> true seeming moments check out henry <UNK> big <UNK> <UNK> across the deck his shockingly beautiful second visit with his girl by the river his <UNK> with mary todd on the <UNK> and the priceless business that follows <UNK> we've got to hurry ' things do thin out once we settle into the big courtroom drama but fonda is priceless throughout
<START> if there were two more charming performers than peter ustinov and maggie smith appearing together in a more charming movie in 1968 i don't know who they were i first saw this delightful little <UNK> gem 25 years ago at the age of 16 and i consider any year in which i have failed to sit down to watch it again a wasted one it's intelligent quirky neat <UNK> sweet gently <UNK> and utterly enchanting the romance of these two social <UNK> is both richly comic and terribly moving never more so than in maggie smith's desperate attempt to bring up the right card in the deck a scene that's both <UNK> funny and a perfect <UNK> portrait of heartbreaking loneliness and that final freeze frame on the anxious concerned loving face of ustinov as he asks are you all right has anyone ever made the look and sound of devotion so perfectly and <UNK> honest i would never want to know anyone well who didn't love this movie
<START> my title above says it all let me make it <UNK> if you have seen the <UNK> planet earth which i am sure most of you have then you are not gonna like this movie too much and i own all the <UNK> of planet earth i had seen the rating for this movie very high and read good reviews about it i was excited to check it out br br alas i went to the theater and the movie started i saw it was a disney movie with production companies listing bbc and discovery and when they started the first scenes about the polar bear i recognized them from my dvds at home of planet earth br br the movie continued and went on and on and on me and my friends kept on <UNK> the scenes were all from planet earth br br we were very very disappointed as i think 90 of the footage is from planet earth i am saying 90 because some of the scenes i didn't recognize i have a feeling that i simply didn't remember them br br so finally what this movie really is is a <UNK> of different <UNK> from the different <UNK> of planet earth with a narration aimed at kids yes the narration is quite <UNK> let me give you an example when they show the polar <UNK> walking away from the mother <UNK> the narrator says the polar <UNK> are not like human kids they don't always listen to their mothers i don't remember the exact words but this is how it is so in a nutshell this is <UNK> planet earth for kids
<START> time and time again i've stated that if people don't want remakes or sequels made they should stop seeing them and instead venture into the world of independent film having said that though the last time i saw an independent film myself must have been easily six months ago so here's a review for an indie that i had my attention drawn to on youtube the cure br br right away you can tell that the film is going for an avant garde film approach which is <UNK> in its use of extreme close ups <UNK> and fast editing it is proud of the way it looks and it has a right to be for the most part it is a very nicely composed little piece save for one <UNK> disregard for the <UNK> degree rule and a <UNK> bad <UNK> effect which is a phenomenon that seems to be the calling card for self <UNK> projects br br still despite these amateurish mistakes the majority of the shots are actually a pleasure to look at we're presented with a good use of props and locations good visual acting and some very atmospheric fluid editing which is made more commendable as this is definitely something you won't see very often at all from a youtube <UNK> the plot is <UNK> and although the basic premise is fairly simple some may find it hard to follow exactly what is happening but what we are seeing here is avant garde storytelling at work you can't really expect a straightforward three act structure and if you do you might not be ready for this kind of movie br br where the film is unfortunately let down however is the sound what you're going to hear throughout is a distorted voice over which often sounds <UNK> and worse still is the continuous background music which goes through minimal change and doesn't add much to anything so much attention is paid to the visuals that the audio frankly sounds neglected and this becomes really apparent when you realize you've just missed about four sentences of the narration and have to <UNK> to pick up what slipped past your attention br br so give it a watch but do it with the sound turned off br br last thought was anyone else reminded of the cover for doug <UNK> red dwarf novel last human early in the film if you have the book you know what i mean
<START> this movie is a blatant attempt by the left in hollywood to portray <UNK> administration as incompetent and <UNK> some mistakes may have been made at the time of the crisis but i'm sure not to the extent portrayed in this lame movie my first reaction was that this movie had to have been directed by oliver stone but i was wrong this time there are apparently many others
<START> faces are <UNK> throats are cut blood <UNK> and in end the three main characters are either depressed or they die they even blow up kevin <UNK> dog with a shotgun why would anyone want to see a movie like this violence is valid only when the good guys kill the bad guys not the other way around take for instance underworld and underworld evolution where you can enjoy seeing justice done when the demons are <UNK> in this movie the good guys are cut up see the difference why would anyone want to make a movie that <UNK> the audience beautiful photography and skilled editing in a motion picture like this is a waste of talent let's put this one into the category of the exquisite corpse
<START> <UNK> high is nothing short of brilliant expertly scripted and perfectly delivered this <UNK> parody of a students and teachers at a south london public school leaves you literally rolling with laughter it's vulgar provocative witty and sharp the characters are a superbly <UNK> cross section of british society or to be more accurate of any society following the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> our three protagonists for want of a better term the show doesn't shy away from <UNK> every imaginable subject political correctness flies out the window in every episode if you enjoy shows that aren't afraid to poke fun of every taboo subject imaginable then <UNK> high will not disappoint
<START> this might mean the end of the white race <UNK> a general as a dozen native zombies wander around the <UNK> of europe during the great war an expedition sets out <UNK> the long lost back projected city of <UNK> <UNK> to stop this sort of thing and keep the <UNK> clear for decent honest white people to slaughter each other by the <UNK> of thousands br br it is a bit hard to tell when people are zombies or not in this film as the acting is so wooden even by 1936 standards the acting in this film is bad from a previous decade it looks like it came out of a <UNK> school text book on <UNK> to <UNK> br br chapter three emotions br br how to express fear and loathing female <UNK> both <UNK> place fist of one hand on heart open mouth as it to scream place other fist palm out against mouth hold pose for 10 seconds longer than is comfortable then quickly turn head 90 degrees away from direction of <UNK> object and <UNK> br br how to have difficult heavily emotionally charged scene with ex fiancé explaining your love for someone else do not make eye contact do not move do not show any emotion do not move your eyes too much as you read your lines off the studio wall br br to give us a <UNK> from the <UNK> acting the director <UNK> cuts in long pauses where nothing much happens except that film keeps running through the <UNK> thus 35 <UNK> worth of story is padded out to <UNK> minutes br br the revolt of the zombies when it comes is so slow released from mental bondage the <UNK> of ex <UNK> <UNK> turn on their former master by <UNK> slowly up hill and then sort of stabbing a door a bit and <UNK> a window <UNK> let's oh i <UNK> yeah let's get him <UNK> frankenstein must be destroyed <UNK> though i have just found a bit of hidden symbolism jagger is shot by a native as some sort of ironic <UNK> to all the natives being shot by the germans at the start of the flick see even <UNK> natives don't want the end of the white race the chase it you can call it that through the back projected swamp is hilarious and worth the admission price alone roy <UNK> has a hell of a time camping it up but is totally wasted as <UNK> <UNK> br br there is one interesting moment in this film a nice little montage of the <UNK> natives and white cast members falling under the evil eyes spell face after face cross fade into one another it works though there is a strange little <UNK> in the middle of each close up like a frame has been cut i guess these must be <UNK> <UNK> frames between the fades br br best watched with friends and in a silly mood
<START> writers perry and randy <UNK> crafted a very engaging little story in chances are br br using the idea of a <UNK> man who happens to return to his former wife's home many years later the plot takes unexpected delightful turns br br twenty four year old robert downey jr <UNK> a delightful performance <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> shepherd as the widow and ryan <UNK> as a good friend br br this trio has just the right chemistry for this caper playing off one another with a <UNK> style i've watched this film a number of times on tv and each time found it most enjoyable
<START> wow how bad can it get this was seriously bad not in terms of the gore which was mainly laughable cgi but in acting atmosphere and direction br br the story was dreadful the character arc of the main lead was a total joke within a few nights of stalking <UNK> jones he starts to become <UNK> to the point of crying when <UNK> his girlfriend um are all new york <UNK> this childish <UNK> and weak his character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever and by the very end you'll be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable and totally absurd twist his character takes br br the gory moments were clearly just a weak low self <UNK> effort to jump onto the modern mtv style gore <UNK> all cgi blood yet no real emotion whatsoever these parts were unintentionally funny and distracting by their self consciousness wacky camera angles etc br br overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea what could have had atmosphere until the stupid monsters at the end is ruined in favour of <UNK> at <UNK> self conscious directing this film wasn't made for and audience it was made for a <UNK> a deeply selfish motive
<START> i am so confused what in the world was this movie about what was the killer's motivation he seemed quite angry but i have yet to figure out why nothing in this movie made sense it had zero depth or less than zero depth which i guess would make it a hill or a pile of crap the acting was horrible when i searched for a few of the actors in this movie they had been in very few things that i had heard of and that came as absolutely no surprise i can't decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in a movie this bad or to feel that they should never be offered another acting job again starting now seinfeld reference really though don't waste your time with this there's so little substance that there's nothing there even just to make fun of this was undoubtedly one of the worst slasher flicks no one of the worst flicks of any kind that i have ever had the misfortune to watch and i've seen quite a few
<START> this film was so predictable that during the entire time you're hoping that the obvious suspect is innocent and there's some other big twist still coming however it doesn't he just continues to act creepy and she continues to ignore it mary found very <UNK> evidence at his place and she still trusted him and what was that <UNK> the trap there was no trap she confronted him he said excuse me i have to go kill someone he left and that was the end of it they make attempts to use other suspects like that one older carnival girl at the end but they're completely underdeveloped actually all the characters are underdeveloped they have no depth and the setting is just plain strange who hangs out in a <UNK> factory its choppy and nothing is well developed for example when she leaves his place after having the beer and he finds the <UNK> and she runs out and he catches her and they end up having sex in that car what was that her reactions weren't portrayed in the car she acted scared like it could have been practically rape but then all we see is her <UNK> the next morning <UNK> it could have been so much better <UNK> much better
<START> lesbian vampire film about a couple on holiday who are staying on the grounds of what they think is an empty <UNK> house but is really being used as a pair of lesbian vampires as the vampires bring in the occasional victim the couple go about their business until the two groups come crashing together br br great looking film with two very sexy women as the vampires there is nothing beyond the eye candy that they provide to recommend this cult film yes its a sexy vampire story no it is not remotely interesting beyond the women to be honest there is a reason that i've been seeing stills of this film in horror books and magazines it looks great but other than that br br for those who want to see sexy vampires only
<START> i had never heard of this one before the owner of my local dvd rental <UNK> mentioned it to me being a 1980s horror flick with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the u k i decided to check it out the film turned out be a dull amateurish and ugly looking ride the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is <UNK> half of the time whereas the acting gives new meaning to the word inept br br <UNK> worse the film follows the awfully tired formula of a trio of teenage girls being involved in an accident and finding themselves <UNK> by a dysfunctional family living in remote surroundings soon one of the girls goes to look for help and is never heard from again another still bed ridden is quickly <UNK> of after being forgotten for most of the duration the heroine is the one to interact the most with the three inhabitants of the house a <UNK> of a bible <UNK> mother cue horrendous overacting her repressed and long suffering daughter and the <UNK> weirdo brother who occasionally appears on the scene to <UNK> over the sleeping female guests br br often <UNK> to dinner table <UNK> by the man hating mother as a means of filling in the dreary to say nothing of unoriginal <UNK> and which <UNK> develop into mother daughter <UNK> <UNK> the film does have one ace up its <UNK> â the twist ending is as unexpected as it is ingenious but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film as much through the <UNK> of it all as the <UNK> gore or the <UNK> feeling of having wasted 80 minutes of my time
<START> ok at the beginning it looked like shrek the loner that is <UNK> followed by the comic relief then it <UNK> into something really compelling as the <UNK> is set and the result is an enjoyable movie which has moments that i agree that are a little too dramatic for kids to watch <UNK> past for example the premise has been obviously worked for a long time so that they can <UNK> in making a movie set with almost no different sets only ice <UNK> and rocks and three characters it's a good thing to know that they succeed in doing something emotional out of it as i said it can be tear <UNK> at some times so kids be warned the real letdown is the animation this wasn't so <UNK> up like the toy story movies or shrek and it shows the humans are unrealistic and we have seen better examples of cgi before but don't let this <UNK> the record as a solo effort ice age is commendable and it will gather many fans i have no doubt oh and yes the moments with that small mouse are priceless and show stealing
<START> whatever happened to british tv drama from john major through tony blair the focus of the genre appears to have <UNK> from social realism to <UNK> <UNK> women focused tales about the <UNK> domestic problems of nice middle class professionals br br or perhaps <UNK> doesn't buy the good stuff please let that be what it is br br the writer's long career in <UNK> probably explains why the dialogue is made up mostly of stale clichés <UNK> <UNK> performance is strong on meaningful looks each held by the director for at least half a dozen beats longer than they deserve <UNK> looks however are a poor substitute for depth of character if the writer has failed to provide such material for actors to work with br br of course this is <UNK> a thriller about a murder investigation but that's not as important as the central character's failing marriage and its attendant problems is <UNK> character's husband a complete bastard will her son be utterly traumatized by the marriage break up making these the central issues isn't a sign of insight it <UNK> a profoundly <UNK> <UNK> by the writer and director with a character who should be getting on with her job br br <UNK> la <UNK> knows how to write this stuff so that it feels as if it matters and involves viewers other than <UNK> <UNK> evidently paula <UNK> isn't up to the task
<START> war inc is a funny but strange film the actors are likable the film is likable also but i don't know how to describe the plot i will go into the plot later on this is a movie with some weird casting choices besides john cusack as a hit man which we saw years ago in <UNK> point blank which i liked br br here we have <UNK> duff playing a russian pop star named <UNK> <UNK> or something like that her character is odd there is a scene where she sticks a <UNK> down her pants and hits on <UNK> cusack there is a twist in the end involving the two characters it makes sense br br that is the only casting choice i am going into cause it just plain strange the whole movie is strange but at times incredibly funny and i was never bored here we have some of the best actors out there <UNK> miss duff she ain't great but here we have john cusack marisa <UNK> joan cusack ben kingsley see what i mean br br this is the story of a hit man named <UNK> cusack he is sent down to some middle eastern city to put a hit on an oil man named omar <UNK> not the actor while trying to deal with his own personal problems he has to help out the wedding of a <UNK> played by <UNK> duff and he falls in love with a news reporter played by marisa <UNK> there is a thing about the <UNK> though <UNK> is disgusted by her there is a scene where she is singing a song to him and afterwards he throws up br br the twist in the end of the film reveals kind of why the thing about the twist is that i did kind of see it coming but that doesn't matter this is a strange funny and entertaining comedy i love most of the actors so really how could i not recommend it br br war inc 3 5 5
<START> it's a bad movie it seems like there is only 5 police in hk they were not using there gun and this makes me feel like a <UNK> chan's movie all the time they were using their gun to point at the suspect only when they finally use their gun is when they kill each other what a funny movie in the movie it's like all the good guys died without a reason br br they story line of the movie also sucks the story jump here and there and bored people but if you wanted to see a bloody movie i think this is only a ok type of movie i think u s made zombie movie is more <UNK> than this one
<START> baby face is a fast paced wise cracking knowing <UNK> of a film that br br lasts only an hour and 15 minutes but oh what a smart 75 minutes they br br are that a story that covers so much ground could be told in such a br br short time puts most of today's movie makers to shame screenwriters of br br today should study the economy of baby face and cut the <UNK> that br br <UNK> so many of their films br br the story is no nonsense an amoral woman rises to wealth first under br br and then over the bodies of the men who fall <UNK> in love with her br br sure the production code <UNK> it up with a redeeming happy ending br br but it isn't hard to see in which the direction the writers wanted to br br go so enjoy what's there and use your imagination for the rest stanwyck is terrific as is george brent and <UNK> <UNK> as a br br hapless <UNK> not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one if br br you've never seen baby face catch it the next time it's shown on cable br br or rent the <UNK> it's worth the effort
<START> how many centuries will pass until the japanese asian horror films abandon the long haired ghost woman <UNK> admittedly they've managed to rip off <UNK> a million times and often it worked well which just goes to show that originality isn't that much of a <UNK> in the horror genre or that i'm very <UNK> and easy to please however this time around i found myself a little restless somewhat bored it's not a bad film but it's at least half an hour longer than it should be with its absurd <UNK> minutes length compared to many other japanese horror films <UNK> lacks atmosphere and excitement plus the ending is confusing it makes no sense at all as for the ring tone miike could have come up with a melody that is more effective than that forgettable little thing even though it was played a dozen times i can't even remember it that's how scary it was speaking of miike for him this is something of a commercial venture so if anyone thinks they might be getting <UNK> of the <UNK> q or audition kind they're wasting their time
<START> ok i own this dvd i got it new at amazon i mean i think its <UNK> and a pretty cool flick and melissa <UNK> the <UNK> bitchy girl they pick up is hot as hell the acting sucks and the whole <UNK> just sucks the clown is some huge guy wearing a mask and its disgusting but its ok i wouldn't recommend it if like u wanted to rent a good entertaining flick after a hard days work but if u have nothing else to do and <UNK> <UNK> with this stupid movies like i am watch it sometime and i do not know how <UNK> dvd has s i c k in its dvd collection s i c k is not good enough to be owned by a half way decent movie company ok well thats all
<START> the <UNK> of this movie was lost from the beginning when the writers and directors left out a good story line only to substitute with horrible special affects this movie seemed to be focused on amusing children but couldn't even accomplish that many small low budget films have the potential to become great movies but this movie is no where near that fortunately this will be another film easily made and easily forgotten this movie was probably a chance for the actors to make a little money on the side until their chance came along for a real role in a good movie anyone who has a shred of respect for films should avoid seeing this movie at all costs
<START> this is the story of two guys who found a copy of <UNK> monkey ' finding this seemed odd at the time <UNK> that there are still posters for the movie at the local <UNK> <UNK> after seeing such classics as <UNK> which way but <UNK> and <UNK> x ' these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome br br these guys were in for a long ride as they watched this movie there was some monkey that was replaced by a stunt man when action sequences were required it was apparent that the monkey wasn't trained in the school of shakespearean acting perhaps replacing the monkey with ben affleck might have helped the guys thought br br maybe a strong sidekick would help like a jackie chan or heck maybe even hulk hogan luckily this movie had amazing martial artist and jet li look a like matthew <UNK> while some might argue that matthew <UNK> doesn't come close to jet li camera tricks prove that he is every bit as good when it becomes obvious that an <UNK> <UNK> can't handle the movie the movie <UNK> on matthew <UNK> to be the real star br br did i mention that there is some <UNK> kid that develops a bond with <UNK> and the monkey is there a possibility that the kid learns confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie even matthew <UNK> should get jealous with this one because using the pick up line <UNK> second <UNK> to a <UNK> doesn't seem to work with the ladies br br shortly after watching this movie the two guys got a phone call from matthew <UNK> telling them <UNK> days '
<START> i thought i was going to watch a scary movie and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie in the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf i thought they was kidding todays computer games have ten times better animations low budget is a fitting comment i would recommend wolf 1994 with jack nicholson for a good werewolf movie it has good special effects as they should be human <UNK> to werewolf unless you wish to have good laugh i would not recommend you to watch this movie this movie is a joke
<START> this is a weak sequel it lacks the interest and light touch of the magnificent man called horse in nearly every aspect and when compared to each other they hardly seem to be the same genre br br the return is almost a parody of the first and tries to evoke different indian <UNK> but comes across as trying way too hard to bottle the magic of the first in this film the tribe is lost and abandoned having lost their <UNK> modern life has <UNK> on paradise and they are living in <UNK> misery and poverty perhaps this is the point the first film took us to a place where we would want to be a simpler time this takes us to broken indians in a miserable world and the white man is the hero and <UNK> which rather <UNK> the whole idea of the film br br the beauty of the first lay in the fact that the white man <UNK> and discovered that real civilization lies in values rather than western <UNK> in the second film this is all but lacking and so we end up with a weak film br br a huge disappointment
<START> the first and second seasons started off <UNK> with good episodes <UNK> in between average ones and at times <UNK> to clichéd stories but once it started to set up the universe in which it exists and started to develop it's characters more it became a lot more fun and entertaining br br the main reason this show succeeds it because of four men richard dean anderson peter <UNK> joseph <UNK> and paul <UNK> <UNK> dry sense of humour makes to show so much better <UNK> directing is excellent and makes any episode so much more entertaining and joe paul never fail to make a funny interesting episode together br br once you understand what the show is about and get to know the characters i doubt you won't like the show for those getting into the show i suggest the episodes 'the other <UNK> a good serious episode and <UNK> of <UNK> a classic comic relief episode
<START> four teenage girls in a <UNK> of los angeles get into all kinds of trouble parties drugs cops mixed up parents older boyfriends jodie foster sort of the mother <UNK> of the pack tries keeping everyone together like a family like the family unit she's never had and the heartbreaking thing about the movie is that she can't slowly everyone grows up and goes away that precise plot point though <UNK> throughout is unfortunately <UNK> with did we really need a long sequence with scott <UNK> <UNK> a car full of thugs on his <UNK> or an even longer sequence also with <UNK> where foster has a strange <UNK> about the pain of illusion some of the dialogue in fact is downright <UNK> and i didn't much care for an edit late in the film that <UNK> clumsily from a death to a wedding but these are <UNK> in what is basically a very sensitive story about the loss of a tight bond and <UNK> face at the ending speaks volumes if viewers do get <UNK> up at the end the movie has earned this it doesn't <UNK> for tears or ask for sympathy it shows us an example of friendship and hopes we understand from
<START> there's so little here of the fantastic anne rice book that what is here makes no sense some of the characters intense and surprising characters don't make it to the screen at all and those who do are watered down to the point that there's no reason for their existence br br where's the relationship between <UNK> and marcel where's the continued affair between marcel and juliet why does <UNK> rose appear at all since her story's never explained where's the rape and redemption of marie whose greatest <UNK> and downfall is that she can pass for white and her marriage to richard why does the film end with <UNK> beating at the hands of his father we learn nothing of <UNK> beyond that she's a bitch who hates her husband why no <UNK> explaining this hatred br br as for the performances there's not a one that's better than mediocre though that's likely due to the lousy script best of the lot is that of the actor playing richard but <UNK> not on screen enough to salvage the film worst is <UNK> guy as <UNK> rose though again it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she's given to work with br br all in all this is just terrible i thought it'd be impossible for any anne rice book turned film to be worse than exit to <UNK> but feast of all saints makes that mess look like a critical hit how is it that rice is such a slut she'll allow her best works to become such junk on the screen
<START> bravo to <UNK> their once powerful movie industry seems to <UNK> from post communist <UNK> br br the <UNK> is a comedy done with all the elements you would expect to see in a modern hollywood production minus the garbage that seems to get attached to the genre over the past several years superb soundtrack excellent visual editing beautiful <UNK> <UNK> to mention but a few br br the story is actually comprised of several sub stories that frequently <UNK> and <UNK> an is in essence a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> desires it follows a group of urban youth to mid thirties people through a variety of situations ranging from daily life and <UNK> activities to careers and <UNK> and it is <UNK> there's actually a point in the movie where the entire theatre i was in about a 100 people in a small art gallery laughed non stop for about 40 50 seconds how often do you experience that with modern hollywood productions br br although the entire main cast is excellent especially the upcoming <UNK> star <UNK> <UNK> in the role of an immigrant facing the all too familiar <UNK> i have to single out <UNK> <UNK> for his superbly <UNK> portrayal of <UNK> a constantly stoned <UNK> whose brain is severely affected by the stuff he <UNK> landing him in a <UNK> of funny situations br br conclusion don't miss this one it's got a lot to offer
<START> hollow point though clumsy in places manages to be an extremely endearing and amusing action movie br br the primary entertainment value here is humor everyone turns in clever performances that provide the film with a great deal of energy br br oh by the way <UNK> of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie
<START> jim belushi is having a mid life crisis nothing is going right when his car goes out on him he goes into an empty bar where michael caine shows him what life <UNK> been like if one event in high school had come out differently a good premise with some moments but mostly flat and uninteresting on a scale of one to ten 3
<START> i watched this with my whole family as a 9 year old in 1964 on our black and white tv i remember my father <UNK> that this is how it could have happened adam and eve i vividly remember the scene when adam finds eve her eyes were <UNK> i asked my father why were her eyes <UNK> and he told because she was tired and hungry having not seen this episode in 45 years i still remember it vividly the tv <UNK> back and forth with the home planet scenes of bombs shaking the <UNK> with the final scene of the two walking off adam carrying his pack and eve following it may not have been a theatrical work of art but it certainly left an impression on me all these years
<START> i only watched this because it starred <UNK> lawrence who i knew br br from whose line is it anyway the wacky british <UNK> br br comedy show i was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem it is uplifting touching and br br romantic without being sappy or sentimental the characters are br br all real people with real <UNK> fears and needs see it
<START> eric <UNK> 'the lady and the <UNK> is based on the <UNK> of an english aristocrat who lived through the french revolution but it's a stilted affair with its strange painted backdrops and mannered <UNK> tone most notably this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie and little of the chaos poverty and terror that <UNK> away from the drawing rooms of the <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> classes the result is frequently dull and ultimately <UNK> about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction it's a disappointing film from an acclaimed director
<START> i don't usually write a comment when there are so many others but this time i feel i have to i have spoken of taste in another review saying it's all in the eye of the <UNK> but when it comes to this film if you like it it simply means you have bad taste br br i love films i loved <UNK> of the dead which is pretty much an unknown b w film i even liked scream and scary movie i liked these films because they have if not a lot at least something good about them i appreciate 99 9 of the films i've seen because they tell a story which i haven't heard before and most directors only make films with a good storyline throughout this film i was thinking where is this going even near the end where did they get these awful actors from was that supposed to be a joke and <UNK> with the obvious twist <UNK> i was <UNK> but hoped it would perhaps make the film and prove i hadn't wasted my time i was sadly mistaken the storyline was bad to begin with and the twist actually ruined any <UNK> of hope there was here's a <UNK> storyline  much like the first film which was alright this one is slow and sparse with no audience relation to the characters or the situations the situations are <UNK> and shallow and completely boring and predictable the twist was terrible it didn't make me feel a thing like excitement or wow just my god there was nothing in the bulk of the film that you could look back to and think <UNK> wasn't that clever because it wasn't in fight club there are flashbacks at the end showing bits where <UNK> true identity was <UNK> shown and when you watched it again you saw more it really was a work of genius how it was written laid out and directed this was a meaningless attempt at an awesome twist i think it was wild things that had like a pretty poor double twist and i still liked the film because the rest was ok and it wasn't trying too hard to be a big twist its like the <UNK> writer thought it was gonna be the best twist ever but really its just a bad story with a bad twist dumped on the end the film ended almost immediately afterward with the whole film void by <UNK> whole story build up meaning nothing and a horrible half forced <UNK> ending with a particularly young and innocent acting girl acting  the actors in this film are appalling almost as bad a sunset beach extremely corny and badly performed it's not even so bad it's good like hunk the worst acting i thought came from amy adams who played kathryn it was a rigid pathetic and badly thought out performance by her robin dunne was also poor i haven't seen american psycho ii yet but no doubt his laid back cool style has ruined that film also br br i can't even say it is a good film for teens as its not if my son or daughter liked this film i'd be ashamed but they wouldn't anyway as they would take into consideration all the things that make a good film which this film has none of really i'm disappointed that some have said you might not be in the age <UNK> for this film and so dislike it i like all the films now that i liked as a teen and had very good taste also do you really think that when you reach 20 you suddenly don't like any <UNK> story lines no i liked mean girls and other generic teen films and watch beverly hills <UNK> all the time there's no excuse for poor directing acting and screenplay i'm afraid besides i was 16 17 when i first watched it if anything being older just makes you a better judge of a terrible film i can't believe anyone can give it 10 10 either one of my favourite films is <UNK> and i gave it 9 as i know there can be better it is a shame for this site that people do that give <UNK> <UNK> or don't get the films show and so give it 2 br br anyone who liked this film really should <UNK> their taste and perhaps their lives and with this realise that this is the worst film ever made worse than <UNK> <UNK> br br if you aren't a teenager with bad taste or simply don't have bad taste you will absolutely hate this film
<START> i absolutely loved this movie i bought it as soon as i could find a copy of it this movie had so much emotion and felt so real i could really sympathize with the characters every time i watch it the ending makes me cry i can really identify with busy <UNK> character and how i would feel if the same thing had happened to me br br i think that all high schools should show this movie maybe it will keep people from wanting to do the same thing i recommend this movie to everybody and anybody especially those who have been affected by any school shooting br br it truly is one of the greatest movies of all time
<START> i loved this film when i was little today at 17 it is one of my all time favorite animated films beautiful animation and appealing characters are just two of the things to like about this film although many people might not enjoy some of the songs most of them are well done and go along with the story it focuses on charlie a <UNK> handsome german shepard who may seem unlikable to some at first but eventually will win you over br br not a kiddie film by any means often very dark and frightening at times a treat for don <UNK> fans and animation buffs but do keep a <UNK> in handy <UNK> never fails to make me cry and will do the same for those who are movie sensitive arguably one of the greatest non disney animated films of all time along with <UNK> down and my neighbor <UNK> br br bottom line a heavenly masterpiece
<START> my room mate ordered this one off of the web a while back and i finally got around to watching it it is gross it is <UNK> it is pretty dumb but it is also a lot of fun i mean this was the most fun we have had watching a movie like this since city of the walking dead ages ago it was like being at the old drive in theater again you could tell the guy who made this movie liked all the horrible dubbed zombie movies this one has all the cliches and tricks from those films rolled into one and it's neat because it is suppose to be like that the <UNK> factor is high the gore flows and the laughs roll the effects go from sloppy to good with the one where the guy gets torn in half and the one where a guy gets his heart shoved through his chest both being excellent the acting goes from terrible to actually pretty good there is not much plot just lots and lots of gore this one is <UNK> after the zombie movies from italy and spain i think because they <UNK> on the gross scenes forever like this movie if you like troma movies <UNK> b grade stuff then you can do no wrong watching this one a nice way to waste a friday night
<START> before i explain the <UNK> comment let me say that the desert trail is bad even by the standards of westerns staring the three stooges in fact it features carmen <UNK> as semi bad girl <UNK> when you hear her mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as <UNK> rita from the classic <UNK> short saved by the belle br br in the desert trail john wayne gets to play the moe howard character and eddy chandler gets to play curly howard like their <UNK> counterparts a running gag throughout the <UNK> minute movie is moe hitting curly wayne's character a <UNK> chasing bully is not very endearing but is supposed to be the good guy br br playing a traveling <UNK> cowboy wayne holds up the <UNK> box office at <UNK> and takes the prize money he would have won if the <UNK> proceeds had been good the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar actually even less after wayne <UNK> the box office no explanation is given for wayne's ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl br br things get complicated at this point because the villain al <UNK> and his sidekick larry fine played by paul fix who would go on to play sheriff <UNK> on <UNK> the <UNK> see wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the <UNK> manager moe and curly get blamed br br so moe and curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to smith and jones who do they meet first but their old friend larry whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest <UNK> rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie br br <UNK> sister is nicely played by a <UNK> beautiful mary <UNK> now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of hal <UNK> our gang shorts <UNK> is the main reason to watch the mega lame western and her scenes with moe and curly are much better than any others in the production as if they used an entirely different crew to film them br br even for <UNK> the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film making is <UNK> bad the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground but there is no horse in the frame the film stock is completely different and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider there is liberal use of stock footage in other places none of it even remotely convincing br br one thing to watch for is a scene <UNK> into the movie where moe and curly get on their horses and ride away to screen right from a cabin as the <UNK> is <UNK> toward the cabin from the left the cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching <UNK> outside of home movies i have never seen anything like this not because it is looks stupid which it does but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner they would film the two riders leaving and then <UNK> the camera and film the <UNK> approaching as a separate action or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the <UNK> and the <UNK> approaching in the background br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> this documentary is a proof of talent being used for mean purposes the fact that it is <UNK> by the <UNK> government gives it a lack of <UNK> in the purpose of searching for the truth of what really happened those horrible days of april 2002 in <UNK> something even we <UNK> don't know for sure br br there are ways of lying and the directors of this stuff lie both by <UNK> and by knowledge br br the <UNK> political process is too complex to be easily understood by foreign audiences and they take advantage of that for instance possible spoilers they show pro <UNK> <UNK> shooting at an empty street what the hell they did that for in a way of saying they didn't kill anyone but didn't bother showing the images we all saw here of opposition <UNK> and a journalist falling dead or injured at the other side of that empty street they can't explain why the <UNK> of the political police was the only one <UNK> to fly over <UNK> that day and did nothing against the <UNK> that were all over the <UNK> of the buildings nearby the presidential palace something that would exhibit how <UNK> would be the security <UNK> to guard the president a few days after the coup the chief of the military guard in charge was asked at the national <UNK> our <UNK> why didn't they act against the <UNK> and he said 'cause they weren't there to act against the president isn't that a confession br br there is so much more the fact that the highest rank military announced that <UNK> had <UNK> and 2 days later he said he had <UNK> because that's politics and nowadays is the minister of internal affairs of <UNK> administration br br it would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this documentary made with the intention of selling the world an image of the good old hugo <UNK> who rules for the poor and the bad rich opposition that wants him out at all costs when the truth is that 60 70 of people rejects his government and that <UNK> includes the poor br br i hope those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version that is being made by a group of <UNK> people showing no less than 30 lies br br nazi propaganda has returned
<START> i seriously can't believe tim burton and <UNK> <UNK> two people i love signed on to produce this crap tim burton is a brilliant director but to be honest i've been losing interest in him for a while since his last few movies were either remakes or adaptations he did produce the brilliant nightmare before christmas which is one i've watched multiple times and directed movies like <UNK> and sleepy hollow which are awesome films <UNK> directed 3 films that i love night watch day watch and wanted i've only seen those three of his but they prove he's an awesome director br br those two people producing one of the many reasons i was excited to see 9 so today i went to go see it at the theatre i was so excited to finally have seen it i had waited 7 months for the movie to come out br br this movie is the first time i've walked out of a tim burton related movie and said i enjoyed almost none of that i felt <UNK> to even have felt that way i mean with him and <UNK> at the production <UNK> you'd have expected this movie to be a good watch right now i still can't get over how let down i was by this movie i hadn't even heard of the original short film before seeing it but now i can successfully say that this movie should have remained a short movie hell neil <UNK> made an awesome full length remake of alive in <UNK> entitled district 9 what was so hard to get right about 9 i really wanted to think this movie was awesome i really did but no it failed on so many levels br br the plot was extremely confusing and disjointed i had no idea what was going on let alone what it was about basically it's about a bunch of <UNK> doll robots trying to save the earth well ok that's what i got from it but the writing here is extremely poor the whole film jumps around like a 6 year old with a d d telling a story there's this big giant <UNK> monster robot that 9 <UNK> causing destruction and stuff that's the main villain however what else is wrong with this movie is that everything comes out of nowhere there were too many monster robots most of which have no logical explanation behind them they have 0 development whatsoever i mean that flying <UNK> like monster just rips out of nowhere we have no idea where it comes out of and <UNK> just expects us to know what it is what was even more retarded was that snake like creature with the <UNK> eyes that <UNK> i dare you to give that description to someone else out loud and expect them not to laugh all of the 3 people i told about it burst out laughing oh and it <UNK> victims up and <UNK> them inside it i'm not kidding br br the twist in act iii is the most retarded aspect of the whole movie so basically 9 goes back to the room he woke up in finds this box with a <UNK> from the scientist in it for 9 and he tells him that the big scary machine robot was designed to bring robot life to earth but then evil humans use it for war and it was supposed to help protect the earth but then the scientist gave his life to 9 so that it could help protect the world with it and he only mentions giving his life to 9 but what about the other robots who gave their lives to them this is the perfect example of poor rushed writing there's only one of the life taking device <UNK> that exists so how did the other 8 get life given to them the characters are not likable at all either they risk their lives for no reason at all the only good character is 7 6 annoyed me with his go back to the source <UNK> 1 is an <UNK> idiot 2 we don't know anything about 5 kept annoying me with his are you sure or can i stay here instead questions and that ending ugh i'm glad i'm not the only one who thinks that the ending was a huge wtf moment br br there's nothing redeeming about this turd except for its beautiful animation everything looks realistic and beautiful i love the gloomy and depressing look of everything however beauty can't save a good movie br br while it's true that this movie is very pretty looking pretty is as pretty does and 9 does <UNK> i'm sure burton fans will be <UNK> to the theatre to see this movie without a doubt in fact with his and <UNK> names being thrown around the <UNK> people will be <UNK> to the theatre to see this movie i know i may be making a big deal out of nothing but watching this movie made me realize how much i hate movies with unlikeable characters nonexistent plot and just pure style over content and this movie is one of those movies
<START> i get it the <UNK> character is <UNK> to be a <UNK> of america itself seeing arab terrorists under every rock only to find out at the end that it's his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices good will to all men everything will be <UNK> and <UNK> sorry <UNK> you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason <UNK> are your weak point and they <UNK> this a well made amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters dialog and plotting better luck on your next flick another thing that <UNK> my <UNK> was the <UNK> point of the homeless section of la being there for reasons of <UNK> these people don't get enough to eat truly these folks aren't eating <UNK> but the real <UNK> these folks is a spiritual <UNK> an emotional <UNK> a mental <UNK> they need self respect self worth dignity which you can't give a man yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available less the center for <UNK> in america i would say it's more the center for alcoholism drug abuse mental suffering and economic <UNK> dealing with <UNK> although a noble <UNK> is band <UNK> a more profoundly <UNK> societal and age old human problem of <UNK> bill <UNK> was good though and michelle williams was cute as the young yet cliched old soul
<START> some of my favorite laurel and hardy films have very very little plot instead they give them a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious films such as help mates and busy bodies are among the funniest as you see the boys working or cleaning house here in dirty work most of the film is akin to these other two films stan and ollie are <UNK> <UNK> and spend most of the film trying quite <UNK> to clean a crazy <UNK> <UNK> seeing ollie fall through the <UNK> the boys making the house a total mess and the insane <UNK> of stanley all work together to make a very pleasing film br br however in an odd twist there is also a really weird subplot that begins and ends the movie it seems that the professor is truly a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger late in the film you see him make a duck into a <UNK> and even a <UNK> into an egg given that he then leaves the boys alone in the room is it any surprise what happens next while this subplot was unnecessary it worked well enough what worked exceptionally well was the middle portion give the boys nothing exciting to do and you'll be amazed at the hilarious results one of the <UNK> better films and it almost earns a 9
<START> we all knew even before it aired the ron moore mini series is no battlestar galactica that's fine it just means it must stand on its own it can't lean on battlestar galactica if it's any good it's good on it's own merits and ron moore has something to be proud of if reports are true this is what moore wanted however if his mini series <UNK> he has <UNK> all the excellent actors that performed on screen not to mention the <UNK> off screen <UNK> and this is what he's done br br yes this mini series is no remake i wouldn't even call it a re imagining it's a new production inspired by battlestar galactica it does not take place in the galactica universe with the same places and <UNK> and technology it doesn't tell of the <UNK> search for the <UNK> tribe nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that <UNK> galactica ron moore's mini series is a space opera action flick with a <UNK> nod to battlestar galactica br br maybe i should say just another space opera action flick because as plots go his has little that's original or even interesting i could <UNK> the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning but i won't <UNK> that on you i'll just hit the most important point ready now here it is just watch the trailer it will tell you everything there is in the story br br yes creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man i guess they forgot <UNK> rules again they look like humans so there's the whole aliens among us thing at least there's no time travel oh and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence the end result was that when moore did draw from galactica that <UNK> nod it came off more corny than <UNK> i mean couldn't he even think up anything of his own br br from the first few minutes i wanted to watch something else i didn't care about any of moore's characters since i couldn't identify with any of them this fact hit me in the face when the <UNK> began their attack <UNK> on a <UNK> scale and i didn't give a damn how depressing br br moore's heroes when faced with an <UNK> <UNK> instead of <UNK> it rather <UNK> tail and saved their own <UNK> after all it was the only way to save humanity <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they took the safe way out rather than <UNK> their own lives to defend others at least disgust is not <UNK> br br but in the end the ron moore mini series was just activity without purpose a movie on a <UNK> forever running yet going nowhere and i just wanted it to be over and by the time it was over my life force had been sucked from me against my own will i was turning into a mindless soulless zombie probably of the type to which this mini series would appeal i needed to <UNK> myself i needed to and i swear this is true i needed to watch an episode of <UNK> 5 two episodes in fact and i felt much better and happier
<START> pushing daisies truly is a landmark in television as an art form everything seems to pay homage to <UNK> and tim burton but so what in a world where fresh ideas are distinctly rare this show will guarantee that you do not care about whether its fresh or not it is just brilliant br br i have been captivated from the start the intelligent writing the directing to the backdrops and dialogue make this show the most incredible masterpiece since the shield and the wire ok not exactly good comparisons but the beauty of pushing daisies is that it has no comparisons on television br br truly <UNK> and an absolute pleasure perhaps like one of the <UNK> <UNK> that get mentioned in such <UNK> ways
<START> there is so much that is wrong with this film but to sum it up terrible acting so bad it must have been on purpose poor script they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story ridiculously bad ending in some cases the ending manages to save the film not in this case if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for this is the worst film i have seen in a long time it was complete torture sitting through this film i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance so do yourself a favor watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do even then you will regret having put yourself through the <UNK> torture
<START> all of david <UNK> movies are terrible on all counts bad writing bad acting bad cinematography no budget the director's brother is usually cast as the male lead but they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity the plot of almost every david prior film as i like to refer to them is basically the same <UNK> all american <UNK> team up to blow up communist baddies but unlike other cold war era garbage such as red dawn <UNK> movies are actually funny because of their over the top premises and acting the best part of jungle assault is the scene in which <UNK> or was is the other dude is being <UNK> by general mitchell for a top secret mission in south america the funniest line in the movie is then delivered something to the effect of this is my roommate i trained him well what you trained your roommate and apparently this is going to be their solution to avoiding <UNK> br br if you can find these gems on video used anywhere buy them they are all funny and even funnier after a few beers watch them with a group of your friends for a true mst3k style experience so far my friends and i have managed to get a hold of night wars and <UNK> aka killer <UNK> but the one i recommend the most over them all is final <UNK> with the <UNK> looking robert <UNK>
<START> for <UNK> sake as a married man the following two films are recommended br br 1 brief encounter by david lean 1945 uk br br well when a woman goes to a <UNK> station something may happen and it happened how she <UNK> to be there in a little <UNK> waiting for the man of her dreams but she was married the man was a stranger to the <UNK> woman br br 2 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> 1948 china br br well when a woman goes to the market to buy fish <UNK> and medicine passing through the ruins of an ancient wall in a small town there is much to think about about the melancholy of her life her sick husband in self pity and lack of future just when a <UNK> young doctor arrived something happened the doctor was a high school honey of the <UNK> woman br br in both movies from great directors of uk and china the passion vs restraint was so intense yet in the end the intimate feelings had not developed into any physical contacts that leaves you with a great after taste <UNK> it intensely without biting it
<START> what made me track this movie down was the viewing <UNK> i thought i have to get the other movies this guy <UNK> has made i was sorry i <UNK> this down it is a weak attempt at an occult satanic type movie laden with sex and only sex with ugly actors and actresses this is an excuse for sleaze the only redeeming factor was the setting and atmosphere avoid this one too much hype <UNK> it not worth the effort of finding it this refers to the welcome to the <UNK> house edition i hope he has some other movies which lives up to <UNK> oh and the goat scene was very boring i understand that this is what carries the hype
<START> i have to say i am really surprised at the high ratings for this movie i found it to be absolutely idiotic the mother gets visions when she touches certain things or people and one thing she touched twice made her vision continue just seemed so ridiculous <UNK> <UNK> performance was awful i thought she was very irritating the girl who played <UNK> did a good job and so did most of the supporting cast for what they had to work with br br i usually love <UNK> and am very open minded when it comes to movies but this movie seemed to have a ridiculous plot and over the top acting and it just was not for me
<START> this movie was bad to say the least the <UNK> of superb cars are <UNK> to have have been <UNK> in this lame movie it starts off with a race from l a to las vegas to be completed in <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> i did that in <UNK> <UNK> in a tiny <UNK> <UNK> 1993 <UNK> <UNK> seriously this movie does not do justice to these cars obviously these writers are just that and probably drive under the speed limit with their hands 10 2 <UNK> i remember seeing on the news how eddie <UNK> crashed a 1 5 million dollar <UNK> <UNK> going 30 <UNK> youtube com watch v <UNK> br br and the director andy <UNK> is the biggest <UNK> he brings shame to his own race i wonder just how many people he <UNK> pleased just to break into hollywood he <UNK> in a movie that portrays asian americans in such a negative and false way asian women cheap money <UNK> <UNK> asian men losing <UNK> <UNK> thugs that get beat all the time what the heck is all the fear about <UNK> why the need to always portray them in such a negative <UNK> i am so sick of the way hollywood always portrays <UNK> in such a negative and false <UNK>
<START> at first i was convinced that this was a made for tv movie that wasn't worthy of <UNK> but after a few minutes of dumb struck awe i realized that there was at least comic value in the over the top stunts and c movie acting this movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and i hadn't laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face it was like a less funny spy version of the big hit i laughed so much i actually bought the big hit dvd with even worse acting we were disappointed that nick chose to marry <UNK> and not jim after all of the <UNK> and high <UNK> a few <UNK> and <UNK> will definitely help it go down easier
<START> i usually steer clear of tv movies because of the many ways you know that it's tv movies five seconds into the picture this one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy well crafted mood that is established from the very start while the ever present rain confirmed my <UNK> of a misplaced story even if claiming to be set in california the movie was largely shot around a <UNK> <UNK> b c the dark and oppressive <UNK> beautifully <UNK> <UNK> excellent acting
<START> the fourth tremors feature goes back in time to the year <UNK> the legend begins in the small city of perfection which was then <UNK> <UNK> as the story begins <UNK> <UNK> are killed by the ghastly <UNK> some of the characters in the present day tremors films have <UNK> both <UNK> and literal in the past most obvious is the ever returning michael gross as <UNK> <UNK> unlike his <UNK> mr gross is inept with <UNK> so he hires <UNK> billy <UNK> as black hand kelly to shoot 'em up some dirt dragons br br this one takes some getting used to as it takes place in the distant past it's like a western with <UNK> versions of the original film's monster <UNK> these <UNK> dirt dragons are nowhere near as <UNK> as their tremors 1990 counterparts consequently in this film the characters spend an awful lot of time on the ground which would not have happened in the original movie and it was weird to have the citizens give up the fight so quickly when gross <UNK> decides to leave town why so helpless why didn't brent <UNK> as juan <UNK> immediately <UNK> the people to fight without gross disappointing br br tremors 4 the legend begins 2004 s s wilson michael gross brent <UNK> billy <UNK>
<START> could this be by the same director as don't look now or bad timing poorly br br acted <UNK> edited you only have to compare the various accident scenes in this with similar ones in don't look now to see how much <UNK> has lost his br br touch br br even the generally reliable <UNK> russell looking a bit <UNK> these days i'm afraid to report cannot save this one the plot is pure pseudo religious <UNK> the acting is wooden and <UNK> attempts at his trademark <UNK> of time are pitiful br br avoid this one like the plague
<START> small college town <UNK> <UNK> why do we care acting sheriff <UNK> the incident why do we care the interviews show us the <UNK> subject <UNK> as different as the opinions of the subjects being interviewed why do we care result a mess of flashbacks in this mess of a movie featuring a handful of one hit wonders and b flick <UNK> which begs the question why do we care
<START> some here have commented that this is the worst elvis movie ever made well they are only partly right for me this is the worst movie ever made period i have never seen anything so <UNK> crude and insulting and vile and against human nature as this film a true embarrassment to the motion picture industry this isn't even so bad its good there is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of <UNK> other bad movies like <UNK> this one is so rotten to sit through its painful pure garbage native americans should sue for their poor clichéd and stereotypical treatment here actually perhaps all human beings should sue for the crime and <UNK> this movie does to the species as a whole 0 stars seriously grade f
<START> documentary starts in 1986 in nyc where black and hispanic drag queens hold balls that's where they dress up however they like <UNK> their stuff in front of an audience and are voted on we get to know many of the members and see how they all hold together and support each other as one man says to another you have three strikes against you you're black gay and a drag queen these are people who sadly are not accepted in society only at the balls there they can be whoever and whatever they want and be accepted then the film cuts to three years later 1989 and you see how things have changed <UNK> for some br br sounds depressing but it's not most of the people interviewed are actually very funny and get a lot of humor out of their situations they're well aware of their position in society and accept it with humor just as they should we find out they all live in houses run by various mothers and all help each other out the sense of community in this film is fascinating br br when this film came out in 1990 it was controversial and a big hit it won best documentary awards at numerous festivals but was never even nominated for an academy award their reason was black and hispanic drag queens are not academy material fascinating isn't it <UNK> and racism all together br br seen today it's still a great film and a period piece it just isn't like that anymore the ny they show no longer exists the balls are still held but not in the spirit we see here also drag has become more accepted in society for better or worse and i've heard the houses are gone too that's kind of sad i would like to know where these characters are now i know two died of aids but i have no idea about the others and what did happen to that 13 year old and 15 year old shown br br still it a one of a kind documentary fascinating funny and riveting a must see all the way a definite 10 where's the dvd
<START> this movie was highly entertaining the soundtrack <UNK> adams is simply beautiful and inspiring even more impressive is brian adams doing all the songs in french as well the score is also uplifting and dramatic br br the movie is made from a mix of traditional animation combined with computer generated images the result is truly stunning i watch this film at least once a week with my kids and we never tire of it the story is compelling and well narrated br br i don't understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7 <UNK> a keeper in my household
<START> this version is likely available at your local dollar store on dvd the print is not great nor is the sound but if you have 1 00 and 90 or so minutes to spare you'll get your <UNK> worth which is not saying an awful lot anna <UNK> is extremely vapid as <UNK> whatever her charms may have been back in the day they are not evident in this film a great number of fine character actors appear in this film helen <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> even <UNK> but the material falls remarkably short of their talents still it is interesting to see how such accomplished performers make the most of the weak writing the musical numbers there are really only two are quite horrible clearly the studio did not feel compelled to cash in on the rich <UNK> of the original no no <UNK> for what it's worth the dvd can be had for 1 00 it's worth that much just to say you've seen it
<START> i'm only rating this film as a 3 out of pity because it attempts to be worthwhile i love to praise a great movie and i'm not biased toward male movies <UNK> blonde was an excellent film georgia rule on the other hand was a <UNK> weak poorly written unrealistic example of movie making at its worst by the end of the film i didn't care who was lying or if anything was resolved br br the most important thing in a film is a good story this story is weak and never develops just because the subject matter is deep doesn't mean the story is good a good story has dynamic characters a dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change and is <UNK> for that change over the course of the movie in georgia rule the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped secondly there were too many attempted dynamic characters pulling off a really good dynamic character is a tough job and takes time you've only got a couple hours in a movie that means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention to their personal change even if i ignore the poorly written story and the <UNK> of weak dynamic characters i can't even say i liked anyone every character was a mess that's fine if <UNK> writing american beauty but not when you're attempting a dramatic comedy georgia was a horrible mother her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter and <UNK> was a horrible excuse for a human being no i'm not cutting her any slack because she was <UNK> crap happens to everyone and we're all responsible for our own actions the dudley do right mormon kid should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and <UNK> and simon i mean seriously what kind of guy lets a 17 year old girl who's been <UNK> just stay over occasionally unless he's an actor or a politician this movie is worth watching if you want to remind yourself what good movie making is not
<START> the director <UNK> in chains and leather warned the audience at the sf <UNK> film festival friday night that we were about to see an <UNK> film experimental leave the video camera on the back seat of the car let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within <UNK> a meandering <UNK> road show <UNK> that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place the gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one <UNK> from the castro theater i would have left too but my <UNK> buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse <UNK> through to the end by the time the lights came up the audience had <UNK> considerably tepid applause pro <UNK> questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product avoid this film
<START> from the pen of richard <UNK> the <UNK> candidate <UNK> comes this muddled tale of political intrigue and assassination the story told in almost comic book fashion is difficult to swallow all star cast considered this poor effort is not entirely the fault of the cast and crew the novel was <UNK> with the same short <UNK> it seems as though at times the story is actually mocking the more sincere effort put forth in <UNK> candidate a disappointment on all counts
<START> really an amazing pile of <UNK> br br a predictable slow moving soul destroying mind numbing movie to which <UNK> your own <UNK> with a rusty bread knife seems well almost necessary br br the acting is over done for the thin dialogue every scene is at least twice as long as it needs to be the intricate details of how this career is <UNK> or that career is rising is just far too dreary and mundane for words the music would be good if you didn't have to sit through the movie but really three good songs is not enough reward for the effort required to watch the movie br br watching this film i <UNK> to god for <UNK> or for someone to shoot me br br never ever ever again
<START> i love this movie as a kid this was one of the first movies i saw that made me <UNK> sure it is mild now but back in the day it was awesome <UNK> are one thing so many people fear so why not do a movie about a killer dentist it's cheesy it's fun sometimes it's scary but it is awesome and i have always had a love for medical horror and corbin bernsen plays dr feinstone perfectly no one could have done it better and for a low budget horror film the effects and such are quite good and i also love the theme music it goes well with the film ken <UNK> dawn of the dead is also in this one playing a <UNK> cop and does a fine job there is a fair amount of blood and some really cool torture death scenes check this one out
<START> acting this film is a very well acted film i will say that the performances are slightly weak at times but for the most part the acting is very good the only actor that blew me away with his performance was jude law as <UNK> maguire he was incredible tom hanks seemed <UNK> unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible paul newman good as always cinematography this is what made the movie a masterpiece and i rarely use that word conrad hall is a true genius if at any point in the movie you were to pause it you will see the <UNK> crafted work of this man he sets up every shot so that nothing is left out when the camera is still there is a <UNK> like quality to the screen when the camera is moving every shot is planned to understated perfection but it doesn't stop there <UNK> choice of colors and contrast between light and dark settings is a work of art the way he lights the set is some of the most amazing lighting work i've seen his work on this movie made it what it is this movie is at the top of the list for best cinematography with lotr black <UNK> down hero <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and vertigo story people will say this movie is a 1930s gangster flick but i believe they missed the point of the movie it is a love story about a hit man who fails in trying to protect his son from the life he chose it is a brilliantly crafted story that unfolds into a beautiful bond between two people who have nothing but each other the screen writing is worthy of an oscar music thomas newman <UNK> a sad but hopeful score to <UNK> this sad but hopeful story the music is some of the most beautiful and moving scores i've herd direction sam <UNK> is a new director with a feel of an experienced director the symbols he uses and the performances he gets from his actors is a <UNK> in todays film making world i will be on the <UNK> for the next sam <UNK> film 10 10 one of the most moving and beautiful movies i've ever seen
<START> what if <UNK> <UNK> had written a novel about a coal <UNK> who decided to search for <UNK> enlightenment by trying to join a country club if he had he could have called it the <UNK> edge since the <UNK> <UNK> tells us the sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over thus the wise say the path to salvation is hard but <UNK> decided to stick with the well <UNK> class and so we have <UNK> f <UNK> version of larry <UNK> recently returned from wwi carefully <UNK> well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal <UNK> br br or as <UNK> tells us this is the young man of whom i write he is not famous it may be that when at last his life comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his <UNK> on this earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water yet it may be that the way of life he has chosen for himself may have an ever growing influence over his fellow men so that long after his death perhaps it will be realized that lived in this age a very remarkable creature br br the <UNK> edge has all of <UNK> cultural taste that money could buy it's so earnest so sincere so self important as larry goes about his search for wisdom working in mines on <UNK> ships climbing a <UNK> mountain to learn from an ancient wise man we have his selfish girl friend <UNK> played by gene tierney his tragic childhood <UNK> played by anne <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> clad uncle played by <UNK> <UNK> and willie <UNK> himself played by herbert marshall taking notes the movie is so <UNK> smug about goodness that the only thing that <UNK> it up a bit is <UNK> <UNK> as elliot <UNK> if i live to be a hundred i shall never understand how any young man can come to paris without evening clothes <UNK> has some good lines but we wind up <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> not elliot <UNK> br br <UNK> wanted a <UNK> hit for <UNK> century when he bought the rights to <UNK> novel he waited a year until <UNK> power was released from military service he made sure there were well dressed extras by the dozens a score that sounds as if it were meant for a <UNK> and he even wrote some of the scenes himself the effort is as self conscious as a fat man wearing a rented <UNK> despite hollywood's view of things in the <UNK> edge i can tell you that for most people hard work doesn't bring enlightenment just <UNK> and low pay br br after nearly two and a half hours we last see larry carrying his <UNK> bag on board a tramp <UNK> in a <UNK> he's going to work his way back to america from europe with a <UNK> smile on his face my dear <UNK> <UNK> says to <UNK> at the same time in an <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> larry has found what we all want and what very few of us ever get i don't think anyone can fail to be better and <UNK> <UNK> for knowing him you see my dear goodness is after all the greatest force in the world and he's got it larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> we forget was a fine writer of plays novels <UNK> and short stories to see how the movies could do him justice watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in <UNK> trio and <UNK> and instead of wasting time with larry <UNK> spend some time with lawrence <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> is a good read
<START> great voices lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie the addition of character to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning particularly the relationship between the older fellow shadow and the young <UNK> chance the earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive which is done perfectly here sally field is lovable in anything but really shines in this film as the proud <UNK> sassy great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life and just the right amount of spirit and warm <UNK> to make the plot and resolution excellent there's even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids hats off to disney
<START> again it seems totally illogical to me at least that arthur merits a mere 6 4 out of 10 possible steve <UNK> one shot masterpiece <UNK> is the totally unlikely if not quite impossible <UNK> of wildly <UNK> elements that he managed to make alcoholism laugh friendly rather than <UNK> tragic is in itself wonderful that he gave dudley moore his finest role and every other cinematic element <UNK> its <UNK> impact including the score seems to me <UNK> and <UNK> i challenge anyone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud but apparently nearly a third of its audience has so managed well i for one found and find <UNK> effort both laughable and lovable and the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> great aunt and stephen <UNK> murderous would be father in law absolute gems of background characters even the black <UNK> managed to escape <UNK> and the late <UNK> sir john gielgud was right about accepting his <UNK> but wrong about <UNK> his role arthur makes no effort to <UNK> much less <UNK> the <UNK> of alcoholism hey <UNK> ain't booze it's other drugs of choice including <UNK> and <UNK> are merely <UNK> not targets it simply <UNK> in its own <UNK> manner
<START> nice attempt and good ideas redemption of the prostitute human beings helping each other out but a poor result the director obviously tried to <UNK> his french colleague <UNK> <UNK> hung by <UNK> an ambiance which is suppose to portray <UNK> <UNK> the only problem is that this <UNK> <UNK> is long gone and when the <UNK> of the green <UNK> had a historical background trying to project this kind of ambiance <UNK> sounds and the slow pace of life on modern days leaves a feeling of fake besides it rapidly creates a sentiment of boredom and the outcome becomes too obvious br br i can only suppose the action takes place in <UNK> or da <UNK> because that is where harvey keitel ex marine in the movie was probably <UNK> during the war but in southern <UNK> <UNK> nobody or very few people speak with the clip northern accent displayed by the actors seriously odd even for a bad <UNK> <UNK> br br an old poet with <UNK> very <UNK> not a disease for people of his condition a <UNK> girl who can read and write elaborate <UNK> poetry even more <UNK> br br
<START> master director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> perhaps most popular achievement is this series a chinese ghost story 1 3 chinese ghost story stars leslie cheung in some distant past in china as a tax collector who is forced to spend a night during his collecting trip in a mysterious castle in which some strange old warriors fight and meet him beautiful actress joey wang wong is the ghost who lives in that castle and is under a <UNK> of one powerful demon a wood devil who <UNK> human souls for herself itself with the help of her beautiful ghosts leslie and joey fall in love and even though ghosts are not allowed to live with humans they decide to break that rule and live happily together for the rest of their lives this is not what the wood devil thinks and our protagonists have to fight for their lives and their happiness br br this film is no less full of magic than other films by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his masterpieces include duel to the death 1983 and the <UNK> series which all have incredible visuals and <UNK> power in their action scenes ghost story is full of brilliant lightning and dark atmosphere which is <UNK> by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost the effects are simply breath taking and would work at their greatest power in the big screen the camera is moving and twisted all the time and it adds to the fairy tale atmosphere this film has there's plenty of <UNK> stunts too and even though some think they are and look gratuitous or stupid when used in films i cannot agree and think they give motion pictures the kind of magic freedom and <UNK> any other tool could not give when people fly in these films it means the films are not just about our world and they usually depict things larger than life with the power of this larger than life art form br br the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm but the problem is again that the characters are little too shallow and act <UNK> occasionally leslie and joey should have been written with greater care and their characters should be even more warm deep and genuine in order to give the story a greater power and thus make the film even more noteworthy and important achievement also the message about love and power of it is <UNK> little too much at one point and it should have been left just to the viewer's mind to be interpreted and found another negative point about the dialogue is that it's too plenty and people talk in this film without a reason that is very irritating and sadly shows the flaws many <UNK> tend to do when they write their movies people just talk and talk and it's all there just to make everything as easy to understand as possible and so the film is not too challenging or believable as it has this gratuitous element just think about the films of the japanese film maker <UNK> <UNK> his films have very little dialogue and all there is is all the necessary as he tells his things by other tools of cinema and never talks or makes other characters talk too much in his movies this is just the talent the writers should have in order to write greater scripts br br otherwise chinese ghost story is very beautiful and visually breath taking piece of eastern cinema and also the song that is played in the film is very beautiful and hopefully earned some award in the hong kong film awards back then i give chinese ghost story 7 10 and without the flaws mentioned above this would without a doubt be almost perfect masterpiece of the fantasy genre
<START> awful simply awful it proves my theory about star power this is supposed to be great tv because the guy who directed battlestar <UNK> is the same guy who directed this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> about a chick b o r i n g br br find something a thousand times more interesting to do like watch your tv with no picture and no sound 1 10 i rated it so high b c there aren't any negative scores in the imdb com rating system br br <UNK> br br ps my theory about star power is the more star power used in a show the weaker the show is it's called an <UNK> <UNK> quality 1 star power less <UNK> makes for better quality etc another way to look at it is more is less br br z

<START> i've written at least a half dozen <UNK> reviews of this abysmal little flick and none get published so i must <UNK> that someone at imdb com really likes this awful movie the idea that a bunch of <UNK> can <UNK> a military tank that has set in the desert for over a decade and make a fighting machine of it again is ludicrous so is the acting and direction pass on it

<START> <UNK> aka <UNK> is a very unique film directed by animation <UNK> ralph bakshi it is an <UNK> of the cinema and is very much worth seeing it is live action mixed with animation seemingly influenced on disney's legendary song of the south almost as if it is a response to that flick philip michael thomas later to become don <UNK> sidekick on miami vice and <UNK> <UNK> most famous for his role in kubrick's the shining are prison <UNK> charles <UNK> and barry white yes that barry white are <UNK> friends and plan to help him escape prison they are stuck at a police <UNK> and <UNK> tells thomas a story about a black rabbit a bear and a fox who move from the south to harlem in order to find a more peaceful existence the story is animated and provides a lot of <UNK> things to see like all of bakshi's films most will be annoyed and will dislike the animation true animation lovers will forgive its <UNK> and fall in love with its <UNK> the movie is very violent very sexual and it is mostly about battles between the races for a long time i thought i was watching something extremely important but after a while especially after i got done watching it it started to seem more like a run of the mill <UNK> flick along the lines of <UNK> it's very sloppy and doesn't really say anything besides isn't bakshi white whatever the answer to that <UNK> <UNK> is still very much worth watching for animation <UNK> as well as cult movie fans 7 10
<START> the lion king series is easily the <UNK> achievement in disney animation the original lion king is the greatest masterpiece in <UNK> animation lion king ii <UNK> pride is the by far the best direct to video sequel that disney or any other studio has made for an animated feature it deserved a theatrical release the same can be said for this movie it has the original cast songs by <UNK> john a hilarious story exciting action and touching character moments everything you've come to expect from this series not so much a new story but filler and extended background on timon and pumbaa and their place in this story what impressed me the most was the care taken in the animation all to often disney shorts on the animation quality of their video and television efforts but here they <UNK> blend new animation with footage from the original film the scenes never seem out of place nathan lane and ernie <UNK> are in full swing as timon and pumbaa matthew <UNK> robert <UNK> and <UNK> kelly <UNK> their roles as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> respectively we even get a return visit by whoopi goldberg and cheech <UNK> as the <UNK> there are many big laughs in this movie so if you love lion king you need this movie the story is just not complete without it
<START> i'm not a huge star trek fan but i was looking forward to this i was intrigued by the pre hype <UNK> of the enterprise its <UNK> submarine <UNK> and rough edged technology compared to the <UNK> we are used to br br i didn't see anything all that interesting in this pilot i found the plot to be convoluted and confusing br br i will admit that i did like some of the character development the depictions of the humans as an <UNK> species ready to <UNK> their <UNK> was entertaining br br and that <UNK> babe had one hell of an incredible rack br br but i don't think i'm going to get hooked on this series br br 3 10
<START> i saw this australian film about 10 years ago and have never forgotten it the movie shows the horror of war in a way that hollywood usually <UNK> over the relationship between the soldiers of the two <UNK> countries is <UNK> by the differences in culture and the ultimate knowledge that in the end we are all really not different on the inside if you can find any type of copy of this buy or rent it you won't be disappointed just <UNK>
<START> actress patty duke wrote an insightful funny rough <UNK> book about her career as an actress her crazy <UNK> love life and her manic <UNK> episodes and suicide attempts which almost put her away for good with this rich material to draw from and patty playing herself in the final act one would think a crack tv director like gilbert <UNK> could bring it all together on film but call me anna is a pale shadow of <UNK> autobiography for those who haven't read the book the <UNK> narrative <UNK> forward in time isn't absorbing we are never allowed to get our <UNK> with what's happening and the production seems <UNK> by a low budget the actors are miscast and the value of having duke herself finally appear does not pay off the film's phony reality is so thick at this point that patty can't bring <UNK> to the scenario it appears as if the producers were sincere enough and consciousness minded to <UNK> steer the film towards <UNK> ultimate <UNK> and mental freedom but they left out many dramatic opportunities in the process
<START> there aren't too many times when i see a film and go huh what but this was one of them maybe after seeing zabriskie point i felt much the same way woody allen felt after seeing 2001 he only liked the film after seeing it three times over a two year period realizing the filmmaker was ahead of him in what was going on <UNK> antonioni in one of his few tries at making films inside of the us after red desert he did blow up this film china and the passenger all filmed outside his native italy i could sense he almost tried to learn about the ways of the country through his own <UNK> of the medium the results show that he doesn't lack the means to present images feelings tones colors sounds and a visual representation of this era a director's job is to see antonioni once stated whatever that means he doesn't disappoint for the admirer of his post fifties work i say post fifties since i've yet to see any of his films from before <UNK> br br what he does lack is a point at least the kind of point that he could bring in blow up and the <UNK> you get the feeling of what is around these characters what the themes are bringing forth to their consciousness however in this case the characters and the actors don't bring much conviction or purpose antonioni coming from the school of hard knocks neo realistic film making does do what he can with his mostly non professional cast those who look most like real actors are <UNK> to the roles of the corporate characters but the two stars mark <UNK> and daria <UNK> seem as if <UNK> under directing them perhaps that was the point the story's split into three acts thankfully not too confusing as mark escapes his existence around the <UNK> dangerous campus life going on in the circa late 60's la area and daria is sent out from la to drive to phoenix for some business meeting they meet by chance as <UNK> plane how does he know how to drive maybe a little background info there and <UNK> car meet up and they spend some time together in an existential kind of groove out in the desert aside from a <UNK> mesmerizing if bizarre sex scene much of this act isn't terribly interesting br br the two leads are fair enough to look at but what exactly draws them to each other outside of curiosity the ideas that come forth in part from a screenplay co written by sam shepard aren't too revealing except for one brief instant where drugs vs reality is brought up then the film heads towards the third act as mark decides to do the right thing under disastrous circumstances and daria arrives at her <UNK> place only to be in full <UNK> not taking into account the infamous last five minutes or so of the film although the film took its time telling its story i didn't have as much of a problem with that as i did that the story only <UNK> a certain kind of viewer i understand and empathize with the feelings and doubts and fears as well as the self confidence of the anti establishment but maybe antonioni isn't entirely fully aware of it himself in some scenes he as director and editor and the often astounding cinematography by <UNK> <UNK> find the scenery and backgrounds more <UNK> and <UNK> than the people in the <UNK> not to say the technical side of zabriskie point isn't involving to a degree this may make some feel <UNK> as antonioni is probably far greater as a documentary filmmaker as he is a theatrical director like say francis ford coppola is br br the <UNK> <UNK> city and even the faces in close ups are filmed with the eye of a filmmaker in love with the art of getting things in the frame bringing us in the soundtrack is equally compelling with a master stroke including a sweet rolling stones song at one point and then a <UNK> surreal pink <UNK> song re titled from <UNK> with that axe eugene one of their best pre dark side in the explosion sequence if only the performances weren't so one sided i might find this to be on par with blow up or the <UNK> it's an unconventional stroke of genius on one hand and on the other a boring take on what was the hippie radical movement of the late 60's but hey what may be boring for an american such as myself born in the eighties may not be to others outside the us such as say italy and it does ask to not be <UNK> right away after one viewing
<START> this comedy is really not funny <UNK> a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact it's a caper film so derivative yes even back then it has no snap br br the cast is adequate more than that it's hard to say however what's nice is that the players are unfamiliar at mgm this would have starred robert <UNK> the wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresses br br we can be grateful that this little known film is <UNK> by performers mostly unknown today and the production values aren't awful yet it makes no real impression br br it's a generic <UNK> and who wants that
<START> <UNK> jerry <UNK> pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film first of all it was made second of all people went to see it third some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen if a monkey could make a movie i'm 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good most crappy movies have their moments even godzilla had a few cool special effects this film's moment was when i left the theater <UNK> the only thing that possibly could've made this movie any worse would be if jerry springer was the star if i want to stare at crap for an hour and a half i'll take a dump in a can if anyone didn't utterly despise this movie i pity you and your children and your children's children's children however contrary to <UNK> beliefs i clearly don't <UNK> children having sex
<START> at least it's not full of <UNK> violence or fluff it's also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline this story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green the story is disjointed and goes off in strange br br directions to no conclusion i also don't believe the director spent much time around a golf country club either some of the depictions are absurd not very engaging
<START> this work is less about steve <UNK> character davis than it is about kline mack and glover simon and kline and <UNK> claire but the dialog inserted via davis is <UNK> <UNK> near poetic <UNK> at its best he is witty intelligent and thoughtful in both dialog delivery and content the writers deserved an oscar br br the performances are easy relaxed and natural just what you would expect from a list actors martin contributes the performance which leads into his more recent <UNK> <UNK> you through life love and the pursuit of wisdom if not happiness kline is the straight the suit the <UNK> of the film and as such his performance is crisp and refreshing br br this work deals with life in all aspects it <UNK> a true emotional investment in its characters and leaves you feeling hopeful that mankind is not doomed after all no matter what you believe deep down br br all in all this is delightful with a gritty moment or two and easy natural dialog which draws you in <UNK> its audience in gaining a high enjoyment from this work it's definitely worth your time though it may not be every one's top choice as friday saturday night entertainment br br i really enjoyed the intelligence this <UNK> it's not typical and was an unexpected surprise another wonderful surprise was the honesty <UNK> <UNK> the couples and friends hold detailed conversations which feel and sound fully honest and again natural i was very impressed with this work and will be adding it to the dvd collection soon br br it rates a 9 1 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and watch this garbage ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i'm well out of the room before it comes on its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective <UNK> such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless what happened to detective <UNK> with real mystery i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago i wish the bbc would put more comedy on <UNK> <UNK> now with the <UNK> of <UNK> finished there is more room for crap like this
<START> i remember this film exhibit in <UNK> spain in 1970 for the time of a week although it could seems incredible and i can't offer any explanation for it this movie was exhibit in a theater dedicated to movies of art and big quality that is bergman <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the projected man few people saw it <UNK> people no doubt and no reference about this very boring sf movie can be found in the peter <UNK> science fiction <UNK> or about the author of the original novel very <UNK> i remember of it after all this years a no story a lot of special effects that seems ridiculous effects in fact and no more it seems that in some countries the running time is 90 <UNK> and in <UNK> <UNK> min well it means only a little more of pain
<START> sir john gielgud must have become <UNK> to star in a mess of a movie like this one br br this is one of those films i suppose that is considered art but don't be fooled it's garbage stick to the art you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually <UNK> <UNK> like this br br in this masterpiece <UNK> <UNK> shakespeare's the <UNK> while the camera pans away to nude people one of them a little kid <UNK> in a swimming pool wow this is <UNK> stuff and real art ain't it that's just one example most of the story makes no sense is impossible to follow and hence is one that liberal critics are afraid to say they didn't understand so they give it high marks to save their phony <UNK> you want shakespeare read his books
<START> <UNK> cannibal or devil hunter as it's more <UNK> known amongst english speaking audiences starts with actress model laura crawford ursula <UNK> as ursula <UNK> checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant jane <UNK> <UNK> after a long days work laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious character's named chris <UNK> <UNK> thomas antonio <UNK> burst in kidnap her having been helped by the <UNK> jane <UNK> agent gets on the <UNK> to rent a hero peter <UNK> al <UNK> who is informed of the situation the <UNK> have laura on an isolated island are demanding a 6 million <UNK> peter is told that he will be paid 200 000 to get her back safely a further 10 of the 6 million if he brings that back as well faster than a rat up a drain <UNK> peter his vietnam vet buddy helicopter pilot jack are on the island deciding on how to save laura so the <UNK> have laura peter has the 6 million but neither want to hand them over that much just to <UNK> things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe hell in all the generations they've lived there they've only managed to build one straw <UNK> now that's primitive who worship some cannibal monster dude burt altman with <UNK> eyes as a god with human sacrifices this cannibal has a liking for young white female flesh intestines br br this spanish french german co production was co written directed by the prolific jesus franco who also gets the credit for the music as well <UNK> cannibal has gained a certain amount of <UNK> here in the uk as it was placed on the <UNK> <UNK> list in the early 80's under it's alternate devil hunter title therefore officially <UNK> as obscene banned having said that i have no idea why as it is one bad film even franco who isn't afraid to be associated with a turkey decides he wants to hide under the <UNK> of <UNK> brown i'd imagine even the most die hard franco fan would have a hard time defending this thing the script by franco <UNK> sorry i mean <UNK> brown julian <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product wanted his named removed is awful it's as simple straight forward as that for a start the film is so boring it's untrue the kidnap plot is one of the <UNK> i've ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved the horror side of things don't improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking over sized <UNK> eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes as a horror film <UNK> cannibal fails as an action adventure it has no more success this is one to avoid br br director franco shows his usual incompetence throughout a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try give the impression it's not attached to anything the cannibal scenes are poor the action is lame it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from <UNK> to <UNK> not really doing anything when they get there either it becomes incredibly dull tedious to watch after about 10 minutes don't forget this thing goes on for <UNK> minutes in it's uncut state i also must mention the hilarious scene when al <UNK> is supposed to be climbing a cliff this is achieved by franco turning his camera on it's side having <UNK> crawl along the floor just look at the way his coat hangs the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along the gore isn't that great as far as euro cannibal films go this is very tame there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it <UNK> bits of meat a man is <UNK> on <UNK> there's some blood a handful of intestines there's a fair bit of nudity in <UNK> cannibal an unpleasant rape scene br br <UNK> cannibal must have had a low budget i mean low this is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects rock bottom production values the only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic the music sucks sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen the acting sucks the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can act br br <UNK> cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell the only good things i can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give <UNK> cannibal as wide a <UNK> as possible one to avoid
<START> superb movie very good photography of 1969 70 <UNK> which seems now to be a different world thoughtful and an excellent <UNK> and production james mason a real first class star it is and i would agree with the above comment that this movie is a national treasure
<START> the movie is actually too slow there are some nice images but it cannot <UNK> the fact that the movie is in fact boring you see a sexual <UNK> a lot of <UNK> and a sexual <UNK> while eating a <UNK> and maybe a little bit more it may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours isn't fun at all though you laugh several times but it's really not enough and it may be more out of despair and <UNK> than out of fun to <UNK> the boredom director tries to put few movie video clips into the movie they are really colorful clips of absurd songs maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it's really sad several times you have a feeling that the plot could <UNK> into something that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow <UNK> and that's it beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music the director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost personally i cannot recommend the movie i believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring during the projection there was <UNK> all around the cinema which just <UNK> my short review
<START> when marlene <UNK> was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the <UNK> papers it was films like the garden of <UNK> how a film could be so <UNK> beautiful to behold and be so <UNK> dull is beyond me also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a <UNK> got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me br br the garden of <UNK> one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert <UNK> who then <UNK> on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for <UNK> performances in <UNK> 12 it then got two silent screen <UNK> the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french <UNK> to see some of what he's missed in the world he runs into a similarly <UNK> woman who was <UNK> and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent she's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train br br the woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer i'm not sure what was in david o <UNK> mind in filming this story someone like ingrid bergman might have made it <UNK> for the audience but you can bet that the movie going public of 1936 when they <UNK> their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day <UNK> rather than a saint with that title the public still remembered <UNK> <UNK> and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting br br as for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their <UNK> and this particular one <UNK> a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret the monastery will have to <UNK> it's <UNK> if boyer leaves the monks are a sincerely <UNK> group but from the head man charles <UNK> on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest br br anyway a whole lot of religious <UNK> get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts most especially marlene <UNK> i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot
<START> with <UNK> <UNK> you need to pay attention but if you do that you probably find a lot to appreciate i know i did the story is interesting and deals with time traveling a virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named cole bruce willis is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus in 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital there he meets jeffrey <UNK> brad pitt who probably has something to do with the virus he also meets psychiatrist dr kathryn <UNK> madeleine <UNK> who doesn't believe him in 1990 when cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is <UNK> and locked in a room and re appears in 1996 kathryn starts believing <UNK> stories br br the movie constantly plays with time cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996 it is picked up in the future and they send someone for cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call things like this happen throughout the movie and therefore you must keep attention you could ask some questions but since you can't have an answer yourself it is better to agree with the movie br br <UNK> <UNK> works as sci fi with some great images and a dark atmosphere and it works as a thriller you are never certain of what will happen next and that helps the movie may be it has some flaws in the story but since it is about a fictional thing like time traveling you should accept what the movie tells us and just try to enjoy that was the easy part for me
<START> wow finally jim carrey has returned from the died this movie had me laughing and crying it also sends a message that we should all know and learn from <UNK> aniston was great she will finally have a hit movie under her belt if you liked liar liar you will love this movie i give it 9 10
<START> with this abc family attempt of the hit blockbuster cheaper by the dozen comes an obnoxious amount of corny dialogue shallow plot lines and cheesy <UNK> with about two good actors among many wanna <UNK> this movie was a major disappointment its a hollywood wannabe <UNK> of an already bad plot then because they needed a lot of actors that meant that they'd probably be more <UNK> so the acting wasn't five star the plot moved fairly fast and the twists were bad and had horrible timing the <UNK> of characters and the end relationships were also too <UNK> and clichéd for me spare yourself and rent something better
<START> i can't believe i am just now seeing this film i think perhaps i thought it was another movie about slaves being <UNK> and i avoided roots for the same reason just as i have yet to see <UNK> list i don't want to be entertained by other <UNK> pain not matter how authentic or informative it is supposed to be br br so i guess the main thing i noticed about the color purple was that it was not about black people being <UNK> by whites the black people were perfectly capable of <UNK> their own daughters or giving them away to be treated as slaves by their husbands it was painful to watch but everyone redeemed himself in the end and the acting was phenomenal i couldn't believe the character oprah played at the age of 35 and i adore whoopi to start with she was amazing i'm so glad i was feeling lousy yesterday afternoon and showtime was running the color purple
<START> considering the limits of this film the entire movie in one setting a music studio only about 5 or 6 actors total it should have been much better made if you have these limits in making a film how could the lighting be so bad and the actors were terrible were talking a hair below the acting in <UNK> except that was an enjoyable movie this had no substance well it tried to but really fails br br it makes attempt to be self <UNK> in a couple parts but the lines were delivered so poorly by the actors it was just bad and the main character <UNK> guy what a pathetic <UNK> clearly like 10 people total made this <UNK> and they all knew each other and it probably was a real rock band that they had but <UNK> these people really have no idea how terrible they are all around this was made in 2005 but they all look so <UNK> it <UNK> of just pre <UNK> era br br thankfully i didn't pay to see this <UNK> on demand delivers again but it was under the title the possessed not studio <UNK> it doesn't matter what you do to the title it can't help this this could have been a much better made movie there is no excuse for this bad film making when you have the obvious limited <UNK> the filmmakers had when they made this working within those limits you should make the stuff you can control and the stuff you can work with the best you can instead they figured mediocrity would be good enough and that music video wow that was bad i fast <UNK> through that br br so 2 10 is fair if you are into the whole b movie crap i suppose you'll go and see this
<START> this movie is utterly hilarious its cast <UNK> immediately with frame one and takes us on a wonderful ride through <UNK> gangster films the conflict of brother vs brother appears when <UNK> brother becomes a do <UNK> d a however the best character is <UNK> <UNK> rival the overly <UNK> <UNK> as johnny says that man should be arrested for <UNK> the english language br br check it out on video it's worth a look
<START> hmmm yeah this episode is extremely underrated br br even though there is a lot of bad writing and acting at parts i think the good over wins the bad br br i love the <UNK> parts and the big <UNK> at the end i absolutely love that scene when michelle confronts tony it's actually one of my favorite scenes of season 1 br br for some reason people have always hated the reincarnation episodes yet i have always liked them they're not the best in terms of writing but the theme really does interest me br br i'm gonna give it a three star but if the writing were a little more consistent i'd give it four
<START> for the longest time i liked this movie better than the original care bears movie well last summer i watched them both together and decided i was wrong the first one is a better care bears movie as you may have guessed if you read my review for it this one isn't a bad movie it's just very strange br br well first of all as a few people have mentioned it completely <UNK> any knowledge of the first movie i can't think of another sequel that <UNK> the original so blatantly especially with the <UNK> of some characters and how they all met when i was little and watching this i was quite a bit confused and <UNK> i felt the same way watching it as an adult br br on to the reasons why the movie is actually pretty good if you <UNK> it from the first movie i can't think of another movie for little kids with a demon as it's <UNK> now i am not for a minute suggesting that evil demons who want to steal the souls of <UNK> and care bears are good i just find it cool that there's a <UNK> evil being in a movie for little kids it's like that <UNK> santa <UNK> vs satan movie from mexico you hear about sometimes br br anyhow the <UNK> name is <UNK> and he wants this chick to help him get the care bears in return for him giving her special powers very dark for a <UNK> flick eh and did i mention that <UNK> appears to the girl most often as a <UNK> voiced 10 year old boy freaky meanwhile some other kids are in care a lot looking after baby care bears oh man demons and baby care bears in the same movie br br needless to say everything gets <UNK> up in the end but not before we get to see <UNK> trap the care <UNK> souls in this scary <UNK> thing in one surprisingly deeply disturbing scene but i am left with the question of <UNK> this movie has found the cult audience it so richly deserves i might just watch it again myself
<START> this is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made the stage version of a chorus line is wonderful this movie misses the mark in almost every way even the casting is <UNK> take audrey <UNK> as val dance 10 looks 3 is <UNK> song <UNK> story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department yes she finds a solution but ultimately she's a great dancer what do the brilliant filmmakers do they hire an actress who can't dance and is famous for looking great way to miss the boat br br then there's the choreography i'm sure michael bennett was turning over in his grave why didn't they use his choreography it really can't be improved upon
<START> as a cinema fan white noise was an utter disappointment as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good nicely lit good camera work reasonable direction but as a film it just <UNK> as predictable as all the other <UNK> <UNK> horror movies that the market has recently been <UNK> with although it did have a little bit of the <UNK> <UNK> the whole concept of the e v o electronic voice <UNK> <UNK> seem believable this movie did not explain the <UNK> for certain <UNK> but went ahead with them the acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion like many recent thriller horror movies br br definitely not a movie i will be buying on dvd and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it
<START> i remember devil dog playing on <UNK> almost 20 years ago and my older sister and her friends watching it and laughing all the next day it's not that bad for a made for tv horror movie but it is derivative mostly of the exorcist and <UNK> for lack of a better word it won't blow you away with <UNK> cinematography or great acting but it's not a waste of time either it's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard br br however if you go into the movie looking for some laughs you won't be disappointed the early scenes with lucky the devil dog as a cute little puppy with children of the damned eyes are hilariously non threatening and the climactic blue screen effects of a giant black dog with <UNK> are pretty side splitting and keep an eye out for the <UNK> <UNK> in maverick shades toward the beginning br br not a great horror film by any stretch of the imagination but i wish they still made stuff like this for tv
<START> a very promising directorial debut for bill paxton a very dark thriller who really done it recommended by stephen king this is a strong well conceived horror tale about a <UNK> but demented man in thurman texas that goes on a murdering spree after getting orders from god to eliminate demons trying to control mankind a couple of plot twists and an eerie finale makes for your <UNK> worth most of the violence you don't really see but still enough to double up your stomach br br director paxton plays the twisted man to be known as the hand of god killer matthew <UNK> is equally impressive as the demented man's <UNK> son that ends up telling this story to a dallas fbi agent powers <UNK> <UNK> as always is solid and flawless suspenseful white <UNK> highly recommended
<START> my husband rented this from a video store thinking it was suspense he never reads the synopsis br br well it would be funny if the thing was watchable it simply isn't the same thing over and over no intrigue and where did they find the leading man the leading man michael des <UNK> is not even <UNK> good looking especially for this role he is given also sexual <UNK> at work is something if you want to see rent michael <UNK> <UNK> at least michael douglas looked good in the early 90's br br alexandra paul who is usually watchable plays an embarrassing scene here there are also lighting effects cheaper than your at home web <UNK> don't even waste time renting this 0 10
<START> i grew up with this as my all time favorite film the special effects are incredible for the era and won awards i can remember the dialogue as if i'd heard it yesterday it is simply a great timeless adventure the music is by <UNK> <UNK> who is cinema <UNK> best <UNK> is the thief conrad <UNK> is the grand villain i have a copy within reach for the next trip down memory lane <UNK> there rex <UNK> wants out of his <UNK> bottle
<START> preston waters is off to a bad summer besides his birthday coming up nothing else looks promising br br first he has to share his own room with his brothers who are going to run a business they can't do it in their rooms because they don't have enough space off to a birthday party he only gets 6 <UNK> while others get <UNK> 35 and even 50 when one of his birthday cards comes early he only gets a check made out for 11 br br going to the bank he learns he needs 200 at least to start an account leaving the bank a bully steals the check pursuing after the kid nearly gets him run over <UNK> his bike gets ruined by a criminal named <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> just come from the bank too from giving the owner 1 000 000 to give to this guy tomorrow <UNK> starts to write a check for the damage but only succeeds in writing his name before a police car circles the area afraid he gives preston the check informs him to give it to his dad to finish out br br that evening though preston tells his dad that he doesn't want a new bike he wants his own room back better yet his own house his father confines him to his room for the rest of the evening <UNK> in his room preston figures things can't get any worse he realizes that he forgot about the check as it's still in his shirt pocket it's blank br br using the computer and after careful consideration he makes it out for 1 000 000 the next day while trying to cash it at the bank he's taken to the owner who thinks he's the person he's supposed to give the 1 000 000 and does he's not though as the real person named juice comes in a moment later br br now the three have to track preston down br br meanwhile preston has fun buying all sorts of stuff including his own house and even going on dates with a disguised bank lady who's really and fbi agent who's trying to track the 3 bad guys down he makes this person up named mr <UNK> who he works for and even plans a party for him on his birthday br br but eventually things catch up the money runs out the bad guys get him br br overall a pretty funny flick <UNK> <UNK> plays his role very good if you enjoyed him in another <UNK> you'll love him here he does all sorts of wicked crazy things br br rick <UNK> the <UNK> out boss from ghost in the machine plays a wonderful friendly <UNK> in this movie
<START> what's with all the negative comments after having seen this film for the first time tonight i can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to <UNK> up any lonely person's day when i saw that drew ben affleck might end up spending the holidays alone i wanted to cry you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why also even though i liked tom james gandolfini and alicia christina <UNK> after awhile if you ask me they were real <UNK> however this film did make me smile and feel good inside before i wrap this up i'd like to say that mike mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit now in conclusion i highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to <UNK> up any lonely person's day to any ben affleck or christina <UNK> fan who hasn't seen it
<START> this is what makes me proud to be british this is by far the funniest thing on tv the league consists of jeremy <UNK> steve <UNK> mark <UNK> and the lovely <UNK> <UNK> totally underrated this horror comedy is perfection the characters are iconic and the <UNK> bizarre hello dave it is a comedy that everyone simply must watch br br the best thing about the league of gentlemen is that it is always fresh and always pushing the boundaries it does not need to rely on <UNK> unlike little britain for it to be funny the fact that the league are willing to kill off arguably their most famous and iconic characters shows us that they've got balls of steel
<START> i'm so confused i've been a huge seagal fan for 25 years i've seen all of his films and many of those dozens of times i can only describe this film as bizarre steven seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film but i have a really tough time believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines with a thin whiny <UNK> voice no less what i also don't get is if they had to dub some of his lines why does his own voice appear on the rest of them i expect seagal to age like the rest of us but the seagal in this movie barely exudes a <UNK> of the same <UNK> confidence <UNK> charm and sex appeal he so easily showed us in all of his previous movies what i found myself missing most of all was his cocky self assured attitude and his bad ass <UNK> that so easily shifts into that adorable grin where is that in your face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star i hope that this film is not an indication of what seagal has left to offer us if so his <UNK> fans will have to <UNK> that the seagal we all knew and loved is gone
<START> a mummy <UNK> vignettes about men women and the sex between them huh at the beginning the mummy randomly asks the viewer imagine having sex with this girl imagine having sex with this boy about <UNK> times while flashing pictures of half naked <UNK> <UNK> later said <UNK> boys <UNK> <UNK> girls with <UNK> if you ignore or fast forward through the <UNK> rambling the shorts aren't bad in their own right i found a few of them rather funny my personal favorite is one where the sexually confused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard sits on the bed this is one well bizarre movie
<START> i own almost every seagal movie yes even ones like this that are low budget and i must say this may be the worst not only of his movies but of all movies ever made the only highlight of this film and only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that a it is seagal and b seagal does have some sweet action sequences specifically in the store and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife next time give me 90 minutes of seagal killing people and don't even bother with a story line because the storyline not only <UNK> but so did the acting the fact that f <UNK> and f <UNK> somehow changed into f <UNK> and also the fact that the stealth was as fast as an f 16 also the stealth never had to <UNK> and since when is afghanistan considered hostile territory from an air force stand point last i checked afghanistan has no air force we usa control the <UNK> also this top secret mission was played through <UNK> to all the crew in the room yet the <UNK> still <UNK> to the other guy that it is secret also how did seagal go from the bottom of the truck to the top please tell us why they <UNK> him since when are air force pilots great <UNK> unless they are owen wilson and since when are their <UNK> in arab countries considering muslims don't drink alcohol also on top of that since when do <UNK> listen to orders from females like the 2 in charge the highlight of the film was definitely seagal killing people in the store and the other 50 people he killed with a knife as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere
<START> i suppose i always felt that hotel du <UNK> was studio bound the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and <UNK> to have been filmed on location but no problem it's still a much underrated lovely composition from marcel <UNK> the plot seems a bit choppy at times as if they were making it up as they went along but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end the money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are <UNK> with some rather stilted dialogue but it's all so lovely to fall into any <UNK> can be accepted are these 2 young people symbols of a <UNK> <UNK> in pre war france or simply idiots suicide <UNK> are fairly common if the <UNK> are young and healthy with their lives before them <UNK> would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools br br <UNK> played the part of prostitute well she kept that <UNK> on her dress busy throughout anyway i've only seen a few films with <UNK> he is the most impressive invention as <UNK> in <UNK> my trouble is shallow every time i see his face i think of <UNK> hale in <UNK> br br a remarkably atmospheric well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place <UNK> and <UNK> made an exceptionally beautiful couple <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in his 2nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man all in all wonderful
<START> well that's 90 minutes of my life i won't get back this movie makes teen tv show california dreams look like almost famous the acting was horrid and storyline unrealistic don't even get me started on the actual band at the <UNK> of this story lame songs look etc you had to believe that they were one of the <UNK> bands in the country and there isn't enough irony in the world to accept that one the <UNK> is seen to be a heroin user not that i blame him if i was around such a <UNK> band with stale songs and wooden acting i'd be <UNK> the horse too br br if you take music remotely seriously avoid this at all costs
<START> 1999 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public <UNK> first they sent us to eyes wide shut then they hyped up the blair witch project and now <UNK> which is by far the worst movie of the year what is it about who the heck knows its full of self <UNK> and loaded with bad acting i always like to stay and watch the credits but when this thing was over i couldn't get out of the movie theatre fast enough most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at felt pretty much the same way dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers it's an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful
<START> i don't give a movie or a show ten very often but this show touched a nerve in a way no other show has i found the entire series on <UNK> com and thought the premise looked interesting so i took a look see i wasn't disappointed in what i saw i was moved this story stays on the tender side as the main characters move us through the scenes <UNK> <UNK> played <UNK> by <UNK> shows us human nature as she wants to keep troubles from being shown no one really wants to lay their soul out in front of a perspective mate so instead she <UNK> a human played by an adorable <UNK> <UNK> as a pet this pet is like any other creature we would consider a pet the difference he can <UNK> in the same way after all <UNK> is a man not a dog as he is treated like a pet he <UNK> to situations how a dog might react she spends time with the new boyfriend <UNK> gets jealous it's when she realizes that her pet isn't just a pet that the sexual tension between the two starts to become thick <UNK> is a dance <UNK> her thinking slowly changes as we start to get a glance at his own thoughts <UNK> takes us from seeing a character who is very one dimensional in the beginning to two dimensional when we see he's a dancer to a three dimensional character when we see him start to fall for his master as a man not as a dog in my opinion it's worth watching this story just to see this character develop plus <UNK> plays <UNK> with such <UNK> you almost start to wish you had one too neither wants to think about the future and how their relationship will change but as <UNK> the name she gives him as one would name their new puppy states  we both knew this wasn't going to be able to last watch this show with a open mind it's worth it
<START> as a habit i always like to read through the <UNK> <UNK> reviews of any given movie especially one that i'd want to comment on and it's not so much a point <UNK> sorta deal i just like to see what people say on the <UNK> br br however i do want to address one thing many people that hated it called it to <UNK> <UNK> but shallow ' some even going so far as to say that <UNK> desire yet inability to help his brother was a mundane plot at best br br i'd like to disagree br br as a brother of a sibling who has a similar <UNK> i can relate daily you see them abuse themselves knowing only that their current path will inevitably lead them to self destruction and it's not about the <UNK> of what they did when how or why paul decided to take up gambling and <UNK> with questionable folks it's really more how they are <UNK> on one hand they are <UNK> geniuses and on the other painfully self destructive it's a lot like people like howard hughes  the same forces which drive them are the same forces which tear them apart and all the while you see this you know this and what's worse you realize you can't do a damn thing about it br br for norman <UNK> a river runs through it was probably a way to find an answer to why the tragedy had to occur and who was to blame in the end no one is and often there is no why but it takes a great deal of personal anguish to truly come to this realization sometimes it takes a lifetime and sometimes it never comes at all
<START> it's a genuine shame that this spin off tv series inspired by the superior made for tv pictures the night stalker and the night <UNK> only lasted a single season and twenty episodes because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor carl <UNK> spirited verbal <UNK> matches with <UNK> <UNK> and long suffering editor tony vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear clever writing nifty supernatural <UNK> gotta love the offbeat and original creatures in the spanish moss murders the <UNK> and horror in the heights plus you can't go wrong with such <UNK> fright favorites as zombies vampires werewolves and witches colorful characters lively acting from a raft of cool guest stars legendary biker flick icon william smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in the energy eater while other episodes featured great veteran character actors like <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and william daniels in <UNK> roles effective moments of genuine suspense the <UNK> set climax of the spanish moss murders in particular was truly harrowing and best of all the one and only darren <UNK> in peak <UNK> form as the <UNK> aggressive and <UNK> but basically decent brave and honest small time chicago <UNK> newspaper reporter carl kolchak br br kolchak was the quintessential 70's <UNK> protagonist a <UNK> and quick witted fellow with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of trouble moreover the occasionally bumbling kolchak was anything but <UNK> he usually either <UNK> or stumbled while running away from a deadly threat yet possessed a certain inner strength and courage that <UNK> him to save the human race time and time again from all kinds of lethal <UNK> <UNK> kolchak was surrounded by a handful of enjoyable secondary characters simon <UNK> was perfect as <UNK> <UNK> ill <UNK> boss tony vincenzo jack <UNK> as the <UNK> ron <UNK> made for an ideal comic foil ruth <UNK> was simply delightful as the sweet miss emily <UNK> and carol ann <UNK> was likewise a lot of fun as eager <UNK> rookie <UNK> <UNK> who alas disappeared after popping up in only three episodes granted the show did suffer from lackluster make up and special effects the titular <UNK> in the werewolf unfortunately resembles a <UNK> <UNK> and the latter episodes <UNK> a few laughably silly monsters the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> cathy lee crosby as helen of <UNK> in the youth <UNK> but even the second rate shows are redeemed by the <UNK> trademark <UNK> sly <UNK> wit and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> presence
<START> this is the biggest load of crap that i have seen in a long time the last time i hated a movie so much was whilst watching 28 days later and <UNK> there is absolutely no point to this movie except to see some really sick and twisted sex rape scenes gillian anderson <UNK> herself on the side of the road and every single sentence of dialog having to use the f word at least a couple of times in it it has extremely cheap acting and is very low budget my friend and i eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour we had tried to give it a chance but nothing could save this <UNK> do not watch it
