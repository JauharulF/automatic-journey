<START> to me this film is just a very very lame teen party movie with all the normal clich√©s and boring stereotyped characters <UNK> <UNK> popular girls guys etc but with an underlying anti drug drinking theme br br if you ever have the unfortunate chance of seeing this film keep an eye out for all the references to responsibility and keeping it real <UNK> how else to word it i guess the only thing <UNK> make this film cool would be if they tv playing it was on fire that or dvd it was on <UNK> br br 1 out of watch animal house instead
<START> the action scenes was quite good but the plot of the movie i would have to give it a score of 1 out of 10 it seems that the producers and director of this movie didn't thought about it carefully br br it doesn't give much value and values to it's viewers except for it's violence the entire story was about revenge a boy witnessing a rape and murder i would even recommend it to be banned those who watched it you've just lose some money if you're thinking of watching it watch something else i would ask for a <UNK> if i was on a movie theater so for you guys and girls out there reading this article please don't waste time
<START> lucille ball tries to look 30 years younger than she actually was in this poor excuse for a musical br br the movie features some of the worst choreography ever seen laced with the constant threat that lucy might break into song with her <UNK> voice at any moment <UNK> total lack of talent as a singer and dancer sinks the film before it can begin and aside from die hard lucy fans no one is likely to fancy it very much bad costumes and cheesy set designs don't help further proof that lucy wasn't good at anything except making stupid faces br br directed by gene <UNK>
<START> when i was a younger oh about 2 i watched barney for the first time and liked it but back then i didn't exactly have a brain either and now i look back and see what a horrible show barney really is first of all everything on that show is creepy barney the main character is a horrendous 9 foot tall talking purple dinosaur that teaches 13 year olds about imagination <UNK> b j i know what your thinking about his name is a smaller yet <UNK> yellow dinosaur that is put in to be cool but in fact he is the exact opposite after watching a few episodes with b j <UNK> <UNK> in with his slightly turned back cap and making a few no so funny jokes i wanted to scream baby <UNK> oh oh god <UNK> oh oh oh anyway baby <UNK> is the worst idea of a character ever she is a green <UNK> it's a dinosaur that carries a yellow <UNK> her remarks of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> cries of <UNK> make it hard to sit through each episode as the seventh <UNK> learn about <UNK> and manners br br and that my friend is what makes this show truly horrible
<START> what's the most violent movie of all time rambo iii <UNK> <UNK> add these three very violent together and you still won't equal the carnage in the the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> action movie i have ever seen for one hundred minutes things blow up and people die in dozens of strange ways it will make you laugh and cheer and when it's all over you'll be more than a little exhausted this movie is a buried gem a cult classic sadly lacking a cult br br the is the <UNK> of our hero peter peter <UNK> a large <UNK> man with a curly <UNK> he arrives in <UNK> on the trail of the villainous and mean greg <UNK> we know he is evil because he is only referred to by his full name i hate <UNK> like greg <UNK> and <UNK> a method of killing that is so horrible i can't even utter it here wait yes i can he steps on people in <UNK> shoes greg <UNK> killer br br when greg <UNK> isn't <UNK> alcohol on women for their sexual pleasure he's kidnapping important <UNK> and heading a huge underworld empire it's up to a jewish action hero and his <UNK> crew of <UNK> to <UNK> the situation by killing everyone and blowing lots of stuff up maybe <UNK> has a different meaning in <UNK> br br and the violence oh the violence this is a film unwilling <UNK> of letting five minutes of screen time go by without some sort of explosion car crash or <UNK> <UNK> the dialogue the violence is extreme not graphic and bloody just really weird for example the company <UNK> one of <UNK> by driving through a solid <UNK> wall on a motorcycle of course when <UNK> on the balcony with heavy fire coming from below the does the one thing he can do he drives off the balcony into the guy's head his front tire <UNK> off it like a basketball astounding br br from the overly gratuitous love scenes both major female characters hop in the sack with the hero of their choice not two minutes after they speak to them alone for the first time to the poorly dubbed dialogue victor you talented bastard the has it all this is a film for the ages right up there with citizen kane and <UNK> it is not widely available in release if you find it anywhere for any price buy it and <UNK> the insanity br br
<START> i saw a version of this in a 4 dvd mafia collection put out by <UNK> and i have to admit that it was a good film the quality was a little worse for the wear but it was a well acted and realistic drama involving low level new jersey gangsters <UNK> once again though <UNK> the show
<START> mildly entertaining and self <UNK> <UNK> but what else could it possibly be cushing in one of his <UNK> roles and he often sounds dubbed <UNK> is just too <UNK> to be believed but who can blame him in the <UNK> of this movie whose plot about ancient dinosaur birds <UNK> humans has 19th century <UNK> period charm but not enough and unfortunately the script carries the racist <UNK> of the literary genre into films nice effort from the actors but a poorly conceived production
<START> harry <UNK> saturday afternoon is often <UNK> among the greatest silent comedies at least where short subjects are concerned and therefore may come as a bit of a letdown for some unlike some of the other recognized classics such as keaton's cops or <UNK> the immigrant this film is in some respects a familiar conventional situation comedy and doesn't offer much in the way of belly laughs one may even wonder whether <UNK> belongs in such <UNK> company nonetheless in my opinion it's a perfectly charming comedy in its minor key way and harry is fascinating to watch br br for a modern viewer raised on tv sitcoms the plot of saturday afternoon may suggest the <UNK> or its many spin offs two dim guys one of whom is married and very much under his wife's thumb try to sneak out with a couple of good time girls for a fun afternoon but everything goes wrong and they wind up having to fight the girls' tough guy boyfriends does this sound familiar and perhaps a little dreary well the premise was already <UNK> when this film was made but beyond that nothing about <UNK> was typical he was odd starting with the fact that he looked like a middle aged baby who was half asleep any <UNK> who catch saturday afternoon will have a field day with the scenes between this <UNK> <UNK> faced baby man and his stern gently <UNK> <UNK> wife when harry tries to hide money under the <UNK> but she catches him in the act and forces him to hand it over you'd swear you're watching an interaction between a 6 year old boy and his mama and maybe that's why harry <UNK> gave some people the creeps and still does br br but he's a compelling screen figure and it's not what he does so much as the way he does it in that scene with the <UNK> under the <UNK> for instance harry finds the <UNK> by placing one foot before the other carefully like a <UNK> walker counting off his <UNK> until he finds the right spot and his technique is hypnotic <UNK> moved like no one else whether or not he makes you laugh the guy is mesmerizing seemingly in a world of his own where the plot of his films is concerned harry is curiously passive and almost never drives the story forward himself in the finale of saturday afternoon when the big <UNK> is taking place harry's co star <UNK> <UNK> is in the thick of the action but harry is in a <UNK> for much of the time and winds up sort of punch drunk between two cars sitting on the running board of one but with his feet on the other while they race through the streets it's a memorable image and as the critic walter kerr wrote it <UNK> <UNK> screen persona quite perfectly he's a passive figure who somehow finds himself in the middle of frantic action <UNK> while the world rushes past it's also worth noting that <UNK> and <UNK> who worked together frequently have a <UNK> in this movie that suggests a <UNK> laurel hardy would follow when they teamed up a year or so later <UNK> style was a likely influence on stan laurel especially here br br saturday and its star may not be for everyone but the film is well worth a look and you might find that <UNK> makes an impression that's hard to shake
<START> i saw this at the screening at <UNK> in <UNK> i had some time to kill and decided to check it out it played to about 1000 people in a packed standing room only ballroom br br wow what a ride the script was tight the action tense the pacing perfect the character exposition excellent one thing i really appreciated was that you knew going in that this wasn't a big budget film yet it soon became obvious that the creators pushed their sets and effects as far as they could despite their limitations and it was more than enough br br it's true that this film was targeted at a certain audience <UNK> <UNK> players the creators make no effort to hide that but other filmmakers could learn a lot from them for in going for the <UNK> in scene after scene and not worrying about if mom who happens to be watching will get it they got the biggest laughs time and time again but there's enough <UNK> there that mom will be laughing too even if she's not in on every joke i think too many times i see films that try so hard to lower the bar to the lowest common <UNK> so that they will appeal to the most people but the movie just ends up suffering for it br br but not this flick indeed this film was so solid that it had the audience wrapped around it's finger from the opening credits and while the viewers around me really wanted to like the film they weren't <UNK> <UNK> can be among the most critical <UNK> out there br br i'm so glad i got to see this in a big crowd at least 10 times the audience was having such a good time that they <UNK> into applause at a joke or scene during the film how often does that happen at <UNK> it should be no surprise that there was a huge standing <UNK> when the closing credits rolled br br for my own part i can't wait for this to be released after it ended one of the producers said they were shooting for a <UNK> tv dvd release that date cannot come soon enough
<START> anthony wong plays <UNK> a husband whose wife is seriously ill poor <UNK> due to her illness he has been going without sex for a long time that's why he is plagued by a series of sleazy nightmares featuring <UNK> and <UNK> erotic nightmare is a fun cat iii flick loaded with sleaze and <UNK> there is also a bit of gore as the first part of the film shows some nasty killings committed by wong character under the influence of the <UNK> mystical powers the dream sequences are quite erotic and sleazy so i'm not complaining of course those who expect gruesome cat iii horror in the tradition of diary of a serial killer or red to kill will be disappointed but fans of sleazy exploitation cinema should give this one a look 7 out of 10
<START> this movie is a bad movie but after watching an endless series of bad horror movies i can say that it is a little different from many i have seen not in the plot which is a fairly regular slasher story but more the way the scenes are cut murder weapon gives us a lot of inane dialogue scenes but they go on for a lot longer than in most movies of this type because of this some of the victims seem slightly less like cardboard cut outs just slightly i had a difficult time <UNK> out exactly what was happening at the beginning and kept wondering if certain events were dream sequences my favorite scene is when two guys are on the run from the killer and take <UNK> in a car in the <UNK> <UNK> they find a <UNK> thank you god one of them happily <UNK> that guy's head suddenly looks like a head and it went on for just enough time for me to wonder what is that where is that <UNK> in relation to the two guys in the car then boom the head explodes and i figured out that it was supposed to be one of the guys in the car getting his head shot off with a shotgun i love that scene but the movie is a very bad movie 3 10
<START> i am being in no way <UNK> when i say that this movie was worse than any other movie ever made worse than batman robin worse than <UNK> hands of fate seriously it's that bad when people tell me that a movie is terrible i use the two girls scale to figure it out if the movie is comparable to two girls then i won't watch it if it's twice as good maybe i'll watch it but only to laugh at the <UNK> who paid somebody to make it because a movie twice as good as this one would still be a piece of garbage
<START> i felt sorry enough that this film is not popular at all even in hong kong however for all die hard <UNK> fan this will be a masterpiece that <UNK> not b left out this is mo <UNK> a comedy style that based on unrealistic and ridiculous plot <UNK> by <UNK> at its peak the plot is totally absolutely ultimately 1000 times more ridiculous than any film that u can imagine the dialog is awesome no single part of the film cool down for u to stop laughing br br the plot look simple but crazy for u to start laughing it begin with <UNK> starring a junior <UNK> a <UNK> one of course caught into jail when helping an innocent married woman he love at first sight to clear her from a murder charge that plot by evil minister whose son was actually the real convict <UNK> escape from jail and run away as a <UNK> he intend to go to the capital to see the emperor and report the conviction on his way he manage to pick up 2 lovely women one from circus another one a prostitute while in the mean time <UNK> supreme skill to <UNK> and bad mouth from the thin mama san who happen to be his future in law finally he able to force the emperor to re open the case by black mail the emperor whom he meet him in the <UNK> the emperor made him a highest level judge to judge the case with the evil minister he manage to setup some brilliant but hilarious plots to force the convict to commit the crime <UNK> him while thrown the evil minister to jail br br the plots are really hilarious and ridiculously brilliant also not to forget the tremendous dialog that include some brilliant bad mouth <UNK> between <UNK> and the mama san <UNK> between the fat mama san and thin mama san to inspire <UNK> to learn the <UNK> skill later and also <UNK> between <UNK> and the evil <UNK> lee near the ending beside that some of the scenes are brilliant too br br one thing that need to mention is that to really understand the film and catch up 100 of all the elements correctly this will be a must to master <UNK> really well which may be the reason why early age <UNK> movie receive <UNK> response only from asian world however when <UNK> film began to spread his influence around the globe hardcore fans like me found that his film is no more that funny like the old time
<START> i first saw this movie in the mid 80's and thought it was a funny movie as i have gotten older i watch this movie for different reasons i like to view it when i'm feeling sad nostalgic for my lost youth i was a teenager 14 at the time of the release of this film so i can identify with many of the same problems <UNK> that the <UNK> in this movie have i enjoy seeing the clothes that were worn at this time and hearing the same old urban legends such as was told on the overnight <UNK> trip the film is also full of funny one liners i highly recommend this movie to anyone that was a teenager in the late 70's to early 80's
<START> this has to be one of the best and most useful shows on tv keys to the v i p demonstrates some of the best seduction techniques and the humor that goes along with the techniques that are not up to par to the person who wrote the negative comment i only have one thing to say stop hating on us because we are better looking and have more game then you have you ever seen the inside of a club or do you just watch it on tv and your so called female friend she is not attracted to us because if guys like me saw her in the club we would just walk right by and talk to the hot girls like the ones on the show br br stop hating watch keys to the v i p and improve your game
<START> i would just like to say that the cure was a movie to help inform how people who are hiv positive have to function in life a young boy who cant go to school because he could <UNK> someone and the ignorance of the boys who called them that just shows how much children are not educated about aids
<START> i agree with with of the messages on here that the book is not like the movie i read the book as a <UNK> in high school in <UNK> i instantly fell in love with the book and eagerly <UNK> the release of the mini series as much as i liked the movie and thought it was very well done i was disappointed that the movie did not follow the book i was glad the <UNK> was not killed off like he was in love and war or n s ii br br having grown up in <UNK> and <UNK> from university of <UNK> i fell in love with southern history because of this mini series and book i had the honor of meeting john <UNK> at a <UNK> in 1988 at <UNK> i stayed around afterwards and meet mr <UNK> unfortunately i did not get to ask him a question but meeting him was honor enough i <UNK> in <UNK> but got my minor in southern studies in addition i <UNK> a lot of my mannerisms after <UNK> main <UNK> and myself are very much alike i feel i was born 150 years too late i am a southern gentleman and very proud of this br br well i fell in love with 2 women in the movie genie francis and wendy man did i have the <UNK> for wendy i never quite could find a real life version of her i hope one day too
<START> i consider myself a casual fan of <UNK> <UNK> for every really good flick by him such as deep red and <UNK> there seems to be one that's equally uninspired his <UNK> since opera has tended to disappoint still there's no denying that when he's at his best there are few horror directors who can top him i consider opera to be <UNK> finest work br br this is definitely the film where all of his <UNK> are present there's no well developed characters and the plot makes very little sense once you begin to <UNK> it still think of <UNK> as an european equivalent of brian <UNK> the style is all that matters here so much it becomes the substance typical to <UNK> there's some beautifully filmed murder sequences those unfamiliar with the man's work may perceive that as a sadistic remark and it may be considering the often time <UNK> of them but its really true <UNK> stages murder with an <UNK> to eye popping visual detail he truly makes graphic violence an art form plus his direction and the look of his films is impeccable br br fortunately opera is one of his most frightening products <UNK> is the only director whom i feel <UNK> rock music works well for horror sequences when others attempt to pull it off it comes across as cheesy the acting <UNK> with <UNK> playing a beautiful and reasonably sympathetic but never particularly <UNK> young opera performer the rest of the actors are <UNK> and get the job done but again with <UNK> the acting is never the point its the beautiful colors the terrifying violence and the overall fever dream nightmare atmosphere 9 10
<START> in my opinion the ending is what completely ruined the whole thing the initial idea of having someone suddenly realize they were the son of god and the second coming was somewhat clever people started to believe him and his friends became the new <UNK> people went nutty demons were <UNK> people all kinds of fun of course then it all went wrong it was bad enough that they had to take on the impossible task of looking through a vast amount of <UNK> to find the third testament in five days but then at the end it became this ridiculous <UNK> fantasy i won't spoil it but i'll just say it comes off as if it were written by a teenager with a very limited knowledge of <UNK> i hear they are making an american feature version of this story i just hope they change the eye rolling ending
<START> i had never read much about or even seen stills of the six man british comedy group the crazy gang but my positive experiences with their <UNK> will <UNK> and arthur <UNK> √¢¬Ä¬ì and especially graham high praise of the frozen limits itself <UNK> funniest english picture yet can bear comparison with safety last and the √¢¬Ä¬ì made me take the <UNK> with the bare bones <UNK> dvds from network of this and their subsequent film 1941 see below both of which were released earlier this year with virtually no <UNK> br br a british made western is a <UNK> but a british western spoof is <UNK> still carry on cowboy 1965 was still some 25 years away incidentally going back to the silent classics mentioned by greene the film seems to me to be more obviously <UNK> to the gold rush <UNK> and way out west <UNK> besides it also plays like a variation on the white and the seven fairy tale which had just been <UNK> on the screen via walt animated <UNK> and where the seventh member is played by ancient comic and frequent will <UNK> foil moore <UNK> the gang actually call pretty heroine <UNK> bell by that name throughout and <UNK> even an amusing sequence with the six of them preparing to go to bed and <UNK> the song from the disney film br br six comedians three sets of comedy <UNK> allen knox and <UNK> gold may be the largest such <UNK> on film √¢¬Ä¬ì though not all of their personalities emerge here my favorites were big bud looking a bit like jim <UNK> straight man allen and <UNK> voiced teddy knox however bald charlie <UNK> often took the <UNK> √¢¬Ä¬ì since <UNK> the one on which the others always seemed to pick on still <UNK> <UNK> who steals the film from his very first scene √¢¬Ä¬ì where he <UNK> to <UNK> every official in the <UNK> theater of a ghost town a very young bernard lee is also notable as the villain of the piece br br the <UNK> routine between and allen actually <UNK> <UNK> and famous on first the film in fact <UNK> on a lot of <UNK> for its humor √¢¬Ä¬ì which <UNK> necessarily travel especially at this <UNK> nevertheless there are several hilarious sequences throughout √¢¬Ä¬ì a few of which even brought tears to my eyes the opening scene where the gang are <UNK> by a band of angry <UNK> their dressing up as indians once they hit the <UNK> the <UNK> to make everybody rich with the same piece of gold they all <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> to confuse the villains a gag which may owe its origin to the marx bros <UNK> hilarious mirror sequence in duck soup 1933 the spot on theater sketch which <UNK> fun at <UNK> <UNK> the surreal moment when pursued by the villains one of the gang climbs a <UNK> that is part of the painted scenery in the theater and especially towards the end when a group of singing <UNK> police <UNK> ever so slowly to the rescue despite being <UNK> on by the increasingly <UNK> ranger hero br br the soundtrack and the frantic nature of the gags themselves made it hard for me to get all the jokes sometimes √¢¬Ä¬ì subtitles would certainly have been welcome in this case the crazy gang only made five films √¢¬Ä¬ì with the first two also being well regarded okay for sound <UNK> and button <UNK> 1938 and a much later reunion though allen had by this time <UNK> out due to ill health and been replaced by eddie gray called life is a circus 1960 directed by val guest who incidentally co wrote both gang films i purchased as well as some of the <UNK> mentioned <UNK> and <UNK> vehicles
<START> regardless of whether the <UNK> social message of this film that vigilante justice is acceptable is <UNK> i was more insulted by <UNK> closing statement in a courtroom drama the closing statement of the <UNK> attorney is pretty much the <UNK> of the film and when the issue is as difficult to resolve as this one the statement is really being delivered to the audience as well as the jury this basically implies that the audience consider the rape of a white girl to be a more horrific crime than the rape of a black girl i for one find this very insulting as for the rest i found the acting reasonable with the exception of sandra <UNK> who seems to be playing her usual <UNK> self doesn't really work in a courtroom drama but what's the point when the film's message is as poor as this one it tells you that vigilante justice is fine and <UNK> you of racism if you disagree
<START> i will keep it to bullet points so here goes 1 very badly scripted 2 tries to be like resident evil 3 zombies slow and <UNK> one minute the next minute raging <UNK> 4 never saw blood clean up so easily 5 special effects not as good as the original day of the living dead 6 acting not as good as the bold and the beautiful 7 it looks like it was written in 1 week and made the next week br br <UNK> <UNK> team plus special forces go into a zombie <UNK> university to find the first zombie and <UNK> a serum to cure the plague all die except the 2 main stars so predictable even though <UNK> and <UNK> with <UNK> of zombies they survived however special forces who were trained at <UNK> school <UNK> only took 1 zombie to kill them even though they had weapons also the obligatory jerk on hand to fill any gaps overall load of rubbish
<START> loved this movie what a hoot rupert and julie are great together with rupert being almost poker faced against <UNK> animation which worked well laura did a good job as the overbearing mother julie of course is marvellous as usual while this movie will keep you laughing most of the time it also has a poignant side to it as it <UNK> the secrets in the lives of the main characters interesting that it was entitled driving lessons as this might lead you to believe this is the main feature of the movie which directly it is not though it certainly could be seen as ben finally being in the driving seat in his own life like most things that are funny in life there is always the sad side and there are some moving moments in this movie very enjoyable movie and well worth watching
<START> price of honor aka price of power is an ambitious western melodrama light on the action which seeks to tell an old west version of the <UNK> assassination in <UNK> the president travels to dallas and is shot from a window while <UNK> thru town in his <UNK> corrupt officials have carried out the murder and have a humble slave take the rap our hero the earnest but bland <UNK> <UNK> aims to unravel the conspiracy an engaging story <UNK> for its subject matter but entertaining despite the <UNK> of shoot em up action the film is a 7 out of 10 despite the poor presentation of the dvd which is overly dark with poor sound look for a good copy
<START> the acting was horrible the special effects while exceptional dominated the movie the writing was pathetic and the dialogue was unbelievable and the silly little love story between <UNK> tyler and ben affleck was out of place br br but the worst offense of <UNK> was the total lack of scientific reality the <UNK> is the size of texas says billy bob <UNK> er that's <UNK> miles wide no one in <UNK> even sees the <UNK> until a <UNK> meteor shower <UNK> havoc in new york <UNK> hires a <UNK> team to join the <UNK> and trains them in a week yeah right someone brings a <UNK> on the space <UNK> with them yeah that's realistic and bruce willis blows up the <UNK> with three seconds to spare how disney <UNK> br br how bad was this movie i <UNK> for the <UNK>
<START> i'm a big fan of the demonic puppets looking at the surface of this one it looks pretty good you've got the puppets and a new villain in the <UNK> unfortunately the little punk that's doing this project to <UNK> <UNK> objects can't act he stinks his girlfriend is worse if they were left out it would probably be cool blade vs the <UNK> i'd watch that for 2 hours but instead the puppets role is down played and the whole movie suffered because of it the mystical skull guy who created the <UNK> is corny at best and appearance is long <UNK> short and really quite disappointing you'd be better off watching the first one again
<START> last time i checked the nazis didn't win the second world war not that you'd <UNK> notice after all the third <UNK> was pretty big on <UNK> orders and demanding cold robotic <UNK> from the <UNK> and that's pretty much what we're <UNK> with today but the way the orders are delivered has changed instead of being at in a german accent through a <UNK> they're disguised as concerned expert advice and <UNK> under your nose every time you switch on the tv or flip open a newspaper there's a <UNK> background hum a middle class message of self improvement <UNK> on the wind br br you eat too much you eat the wrong things you drink you smoke you don't get enough exercise you probably can't even <UNK> properly you'll die if you don't change your ways your health will suffer have you got no self respect look at you you <UNK> me i pity you i hate you we all hate you god hates you don't you get it it's so sad what you're doing to yourself it's just so bloody sad that's the <UNK> and it goes without saying that the people <UNK> it are <UNK> depicted as saints last year the media dropped to its knees to give jamie oliver a collective blow job over his school <UNK> series in which he <UNK> to get <UNK> food put on school <UNK> given the back <UNK> reaction you'd be forgiven for thinking he'd personally rescued 5 000 children from the jaws of a <UNK> <UNK> br br anyway the series was a huge success in fact in telly terms there was only one real <UNK> it wasn't after all when you've saved every child in the nation from certain death once you can't really do it a second time the only solution is to find a new threat which brings us to ian <UNK> <UNK> kids <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a weekly programme in which the former <UNK> and renowned enemy of <UNK> forces a bunch of overweight youngsters to take part in some extra <UNK> <UNK> br br it's essentially a <UNK> copy of the jamie oliver show with more <UNK> and fewer shots of <UNK> <UNK> fresh basil with a an uplifting fable in which <UNK> his gang of <UNK> into a lean mean machine <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> confronting lazy parents and attempting to turn the whole thing into a <UNK> issue that'll have range <UNK> <UNK> everywhere <UNK> their <UNK> with sheer in between <UNK> to the <UNK> shop oh isn't it simply terrible what these blob some <UNK> do to themselves not our josh you understand he eats nothing but <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> six hundred times a week br br bet he does the little yes it is heartwarming to watch <UNK> <UNK> kids <UNK> themselves with a bit of simple activity but there's something about the underlying eat your <UNK> message that really sticks in my in case you hadn't guessed br br what happened to the concept of choice you <UNK> so a bit of <UNK> might increase your life <UNK> so what that just <UNK> to a few more years in the <UNK> home <UNK> do and besides i'd rather drop dead tomorrow than spend the rest of my life sharing a planet with a bunch of smug toss ends trying to out health one another br br in episode two video games and the internet are <UNK> out as villains in the war on they make kids too you see oddly enough tv which is equally and unlike those two activities <UNK> encourages you to let your mind <UNK> along with your <UNK> escapes without a <UNK> funny that br br well listen here channel 4 instead of forcing kids to eat <UNK> or do <UNK> <UNK> how about teaching them to think more so they reject the sly <UNK> nature of <UNK> like this or would that be a campaign too far
<START> this is one of the strangest things on tv it is set in a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> superb called which seems to be the <UNK> place in the country it features a bar with no visible staff or customers a university with no students a police station with no criminals and a surgery with more doctors than patients the story lines are dire every episode revolves round a bizarre medical issue acted out by a variety of <UNK> extras who can never actually act and for some reason the doctor always ends up round their house solving their problem pretty entertaining for its pure comedy value but i cannot believe that this thing actually <UNK> as a serious drama <UNK>

<START> i bought this movie at a garage sale when i was like 15 i hated it then and watching it again just for the hell of it it's even worse now you can hear the director and cameraman in the background yelling <UNK> like zoom zoom zoom the are no special effects just a raw piece of meat that is supposed to be a brain this is utter crap and i originally thought it was a one of a kind home movie or something that i bought but this was distributed elsewhere and it's just really weird to know that other people have seen it <UNK> i need 10 lines well this can be an interesting thing to watch to see how no budget movies were made before the invention of digital cameras this sucks actually yeah do watch this just to see if you can sit through the worst if you can make it through this you can make it through anything
<START> the <UNK> so called comedy i've ever seen br br not a <UNK> on the <UNK> of the hilariously dare twin town br br vegas i like normally but this script is so dire so predictable so well english in the worst way in recent years the english films have been awful all of them ireland at least produced the <UNK> scotland with braveheart and <UNK> 2 stand out great movies and <UNK> had twin town <UNK> last days of <UNK> doctor who and under milk wood etc br br the comedy is paint by numbers the actors are dead men walking because there is no characterisation and no originality and it's just so unfunny br br england is falling behind no matter how many grim up north movies they produce it's the old class system that destroys english films the <UNK> <UNK> endlessly clich√©d scripts about working class people they've never lived with it is pathetic monty python wasn't funny neither was anything from br br let guys like <UNK> vegas and peter kay rob billy connolly or write their own dialogue and forget the <UNK> failed class system let the working class people and the real talent that comes through the system properly take over the writing and the british and english film <UNK> will rise again what next prince edward to write a modern day oliver twist
<START> this is one of those movies that you just don't want to end the characters are rich like a well woven <UNK> colorful costumes music and characters draw you in and tell a tale of the people that lived in a <UNK> house over the decades around the time of the civil rights movement and the vietnam war a young man is taken in by a dynamic big hearted woman that runs the house and these are stories based on his experiences br br i couldn't believe this was a made for television film it was so well executed s is wonderful as <UNK> and she brings so much life to this role you want to be right there amongst her <UNK> br br i enjoyed this film so much i bought the dvd
<START> this is a good movie i won't go into any details as the other user comments do a good job of taking care of that however i disagree with the statement that this is eastwood's best work that is just not a very position based on the volume of strong movies he has directed and starred in i would like to note that i find it interesting that two of the actresses who played in this movie and peggy <UNK> never again appeared in another film or television show in spite of giving good performances my curiosity has me wondering what happened to these two actresses
<START> star rating saturday night friday night friday morning sunday night monday morning br br danny mel is a lonely factory worker who tries to get by with his job and to be a good dad to his two daughters after a messy divorce from their mother <UNK> but after an <UNK> with said daughters present at a working men's club he uses a trip to their dance class to take a glance at louis colin <UNK> and his gang of hard men who train in the boxing gym free <UNK> section there and to train himself into a <UNK> more <UNK> person before long he's taken the <UNK> of louis to heart and has joined him as a nightclub <UNK> as the 80s disco <UNK> kicks in but when associate <UNK> scott williams tries to do a <UNK> in drug dealing everything turns <UNK> shaped br br as robert de niro once stated in the film a <UNK> tale <UNK> no bigger tragedy than wasted talent ' the writer of <UNK> had a good idea and a talent to make it into some sort of film but without the ability it seems to put it all together into some sort of coherent film br br as a <UNK> some of the filming locations especially a scene at the end outside the ring <UNK> <UNK> pub in <UNK> were quite easy and fun to spot but the <UNK> look of the cinematography is really a <UNK> on things some really poor acting for instance lead actor with an <UNK> accent that's all over the place and a hammy script with some <UNK> dialogue are bigger problems for the film though more established actors like and even telly favourite neil are <UNK> to very small supporting parts while the disastrous and <UNK> <UNK> lame villain take centre stage williams does a poor man's sick boy from <UNK> impression leaving <UNK> and shaun <UNK> seemingly the only performers left with any integrity from the whole thing as the excessive blood <UNK> violence becoming a common trend for brit flicks takes over truly a missed opportunity
<START> love jones is one of the best movies i've experienced br br the main element that sticks out to me is the fact that it is very well directed i have studied this film in it's entirety with watching movies more than once certain things dawn on you <UNK> the direction of this movie as well as the writing is <UNK> hip and <UNK> i am in love with the direction the scene where <UNK> <UNK> and long are riding the motorcycle through north chicago at night is astonishing the director of this movie deserved awards for his great job br br love jones is a classy and sexy film it highlights the fact that we can be people who love who have flaws who love living learning and just being us without the hype being our natural <UNK> br br the poetry is wonderful but the story line the dialog and the scenes really make this movie br br this movie deserves to be seen it is a great movie for lovers and friends to sit back and watch or the hopeless romantic like myself to sit back and enjoy alone on a friday or saturday night any day of the week where peace <UNK> and a little entertainment is needed love jones is what i recommend
<START> this film is a bad film but to gain any <UNK> value from it i recommend watching it back to back with rosemary's baby br br there is a lot to learn seeing how different directors can draw different performances from the same actors playing the same characters observe <UNK> ruth gordon and the fine work she did in the first film vs the awful rendition in this film br br it is also interesting to see how the same characters were played by different actors which leads me to wonder if anyone involved with the sequel were aware of the first film and did any of them watch rosemary's baby before making this br br if your interest in films is purely superficial then you would best avoid this one i have a lot more to say about this film but i really don't want to go there
<START> this film was one of three that were later combined by <UNK> into a <UNK> that was released to theaters in the late 1950s under the title the chaplin review br br this was an odd film in some ways because later in life chaplin was anti war and his movies <UNK> peace and <UNK> this film in contrast is a propaganda comedy meant to <UNK> the us efforts in wwi it's truly odd to see charlie as the super soldier who single <UNK> captures 13 germans casually and <UNK> shoots several germans in mere seconds as a <UNK> and then goes behind enemy lines to try to capture the <UNK> himself truly this was a major departure for the little tramp though it was at the same time very very entertaining and funny the film is exceptionally well paced well made and i'm sure did a lot to <UNK> support at home for our troops too bad it was such a pointless and <UNK> war
<START> <UNK> dr is not a fancy made movie it's more like amateur video horrible magic effect really fake <UNK> terribly made <UNK> castle village sword axe shield <UNK> plate everything you will need about 10 minutes to <UNK> your expecting on visual then you will get <UNK> minutes of fun br br i'm from <UNK> and it's really hard to find none of my friends play <UNK> and i always fancy to be one of the character in the world of d d watching <UNK> dr just show me what would it be like to be a <UNK> you see rule books game set etc etc etc you hear terms like fighter wizard hit point level character <UNK> hand chaotic evil br br what <UNK> fancy me is that it let you do anything u want to not <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dr provide the same element you wont know what happen next and it probably just make you laugh to dead the movie goes both real life as well as in the d d world you will hear the <UNK> cast the <UNK> when the character in game take action which make you feel you really in the game br br i don't want to spoil anything but in short <UNK> dr is a must watch movie for <UNK> lovers for people never play <UNK> game i'm sure you still get many fun from it
<START> <UNK> what a huge disappointment after reading the plot summary the dead coming back to vote against george w bush i couldn't wait to see this it started off interesting and it immediately caught my attention unfortunately though it slowly <UNK> into a boring political satire that i didn't need to see i can just watch some good old aussie comedy for that there was pretty much only one or two scenes of horror and they weren't even that scary i couldn't believe this came from joe <UNK> who could easily have pulled it off with an equal balance of thrills and satire br br the worst episode so far br br 2 5
<START> on first viewing this movie seems to be some kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse once seen never forgotten however viewed strictly within the context of the story the <UNK> is that to survive in the immediate post civil war america one had to have a horse and not any old horse but a truly great one and <UNK> wing is such a horse but for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter who should own it the native american or the <UNK> soldier the story throughout <UNK> against <UNK> as has been said by other <UNK> it is ironic that it took an english director to perceive this fact and then develop this simple theme into a western like no other you're ever likely to see again the film is basically about this beast and the savage <UNK> of the environment and the people who <UNK> a living from it the photography and the soundtrack are exquisite martin <UNK> performance is a revelation this film released in the same year as <UNK> other great performance as <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> hints at his abilities which somehow were never given such a free <UNK> again <UNK> the pity a comparison of the two stories throws up the surprising similarities between them not least that both films <UNK> a man's journey into his soul in order to find redemption whereas <UNK> is redeemed i will leave it to the viewer to decide if <UNK> is eventually the ending is fabulous in the true sense of the word and very moving be warned altogether this is an extraordinary film
<START> this is one of the finest movies i have ever seen the stark scenery the isolation the ignorant <UNK> people hiding behind their religion a backdrop for some and sophistication the acting is completely natural but for me as a the best is the actual choosing and <UNK> of the feast i have spent time in paris and know the <UNK> well whether or not the <UNK> really exists i don't know but i do know of similar <UNK> and <UNK> menu and choice of are authentic and of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal <UNK> them back to friendship is the only ending there could be this is a 10 out of 10 film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it
<START> yes fassbinder and are at the top of their game back in 1973 it's about the same subject but in my opinion it's a much better movie than the matrix 1999 at least it was 200 times cheaper very nice camera work by michael and the wonderful <UNK> by <UNK> mac at the end fassbinder is creating a very moody tone for the whole film it's a shame this movie was never released on dvd but now after <UNK> years they finally came to the conclusion that this tv movie is not only one of the best fassbinder films <UNK> there are quiet a lot best fassbinder films it's a brilliant example for a science fiction movie done without much money buy it watch it
<START> brian wesley works for a security firm owned by mr norton conrad <UNK> the norton firm is in financial trouble for unknown to the owner he has an employee who is selling secrets to a rival <UNK> owner jim <UNK> it's not brian as he is a loyal and faithful employee and a good <UNK> but mr norton has no patience with brian in part because <UNK> beautiful daughter <UNK> valerie <UNK> has a thing for brian and norton questions <UNK> motives for <UNK> her however brian does come up with a great security device it's called <UNK> which stands for <UNK> home security system the device which looks like a dog is actually a computer controlled animal with the ability to knock down walls and <UNK> <UNK> sounds to capture <UNK> the rival owner sends two <UNK> spies one is red buttons to learn the details of the new invention will <UNK> save norton security this is a fun family flick from the old school of good clean entertainment <UNK> is of course a real dog played by the adorable and talented <UNK> in fact <UNK> has a duel role as brian has a real dog named <UNK> too just watching this little dog in action is pure joy as he is able to scale walls pull <UNK> and operate machine buttons to capture the bad guys the human cast is also quite nice with everyone giving upbeat performances that are <UNK> costumes scenery and production values are good too although you may have trouble <UNK> the film it would be well worth the effort to secure a view for your closest loved ones <UNK> is a wonderful wholesome <UNK> from the world's <UNK>
<START> okay i guess i'm pretty much a fan of <UNK> and destroyed stephen king stories when they reach the as any of us sad <UNK> out here i know full well that most of them are done poorly i expect it i plan on it i <UNK> allow for it br br but this time okay so i think i saw this thing a number of years ago fine i thought i remembered that it was pretty good wrong like i'm saying granted in a <UNK> annoying <UNK> way i really wasn't trying to be <UNK> or expect much but what was this thing a mini series i have only one thing to say d r a w n o u t how can you possibly justify dragging the thing out minute by minute scene by scene of <UNK> endless completely meaningless and mind numbingly slow dialog i mean every <UNK> <UNK> scene is two people how they feel and back and forth and d r a g i t <UNK> <UNK> well o u t after about an hour and a half which i think is about 1 2 of the running time i didn't check sorry i finally got totally fed up after an hour and a half what had happened other than the original accident they were running away while the guy was killing eye doctors news <UNK> and lots lots lots of meandering dialog br br i'm sorry i promise that it is not that i have to have non stop mindless action i love lots of films where not much happens but in them at least when they do talk and such meaningful things are being said and characters are being <UNK> thoughts are being conveyed something okay i admit that the actors in and of themselves were not too bad except stephen king of course i liked the shop guy i thought both of the people were fine i liked the general and the main woman it's just if they could have cut out all of the hours of filler that's all i'm saying i mean it's supposed to be a sci fi thriller sort of right you know what really took the prize when the shop guy was needlessly making one of his many time filling <UNK> calls this time he is talking to god knows who getting all emotional for him anyway and acting like he can't handle it wtf the guy has clearly been shown to be a cold blooded efficient killer what the hell was that about so just <UNK> that by about 500 and that is basically why i finally turned if off about half way through it was either that or hang myself i swear i mean there are other king out there that are lame but at least they move along oh well i guess perhaps if you maybe are into the <UNK> itself and don't mind <UNK> along and have the supreme divine patience to wait until the end it might be worthwhile br br but i sincerely and <UNK> doubt it br br i don't write these things very often but this time i just had to or i wouldn't be able to sleep at night like i did during the show
<START> i caught this movie right in my eye when i was passing by a hall of posters in the nearby cinema the tag line was sort of confusing and immediately after reading it i thought of the possibility of it being similar to national <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i liked that movie aside from having a huge collection of such genres i decided to hit it to the cinemas right after my <UNK> for a tension br br delightfully i came out smiling from cheek to cheek and had an equally great amount of laughter at bits and points of the movie amanda <UNK> definitely kicked it off better than <UNK> knightley in bend it like beckham being both a male and female actor is definitely not that kind of easy especially having to face the similarities of life coupled together with the reactions that the actress have to respond to this movie requires a great deal of confusion to confuse themselves and us viewers at the same time the only way of pulling it off is through this movie br br the principal is obviously <UNK> hilarious in a serious manner the girls are equally sexy and beautiful and so are the actors i'd recommend this movie to all who needs a weekend <UNK> and don't worry you will get laughs throughout the movie it is a definite guarantee
<START> spoiler warning i seem to keep giving this guy his last chance strange how an action hero who once was keeps <UNK> an audience anyway this movie is about a character seagal being kind of a mysterious rough neck hero that's it br br next
<START> one of the most <UNK> aspects of movie viewing is to get lost in a film to have it totally wash over you so that you <UNK> it as it is and thus experience it to the <UNK> every time i see it 'the is such a film over the years it is a picture critics have loved to hate many have thrown <UNK> at its <UNK> but perhaps it is because of the very tone the film brings with it rather than its most obvious characteristics it is at once <UNK> remote possibly dangerous beware of what lies within the haunting <UNK> of the music seen over the 20th fox <UNK> <UNK> us into titles of other <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br strange <UNK> <UNK> it is as if we are <UNK> into some vault of <UNK> <UNK> might be great <UNK> mixed with uncertain <UNK> one might imagine <UNK> <UNK> commanding <UNK> it ancient ' then what a darkly dramatic story unfolds all within the same tone set at the start br br of hollywood's mid 50s 'the ten portrayed the <UNK> <UNK> the phenomenal <UNK> of the its nuts and <UNK> while 'the shows it all from <UNK> to tragedy for us to wonder at br br no need to say much about the players here but i think that with the passage of time <UNK> is being redeemed what a perfect face for the role right out of a <UNK> painting if her acting does not please some it might be <UNK> that in her role as a she is obviously better in bed than <UNK> to some poor helpless admirer i think that <UNK> captured the <UNK> of her <UNK> <UNK> relationship with edmund character with <UNK> censorship being what it was at the time sir peter ustinov in his <UNK> was pretty kind to 'the writing that it was <UNK> being lost in a huge set for his <UNK> of the word i have adopted myself ever after one of the film's historically accurate references the invented beer henry <UNK> what a perfect performance gene tierney what a screen treasure bless for giving her this role c'mon folks don't be so hard on victor mature he's a son who rose to be <UNK> sounds like a <UNK> american opportunity one of the best moments john <UNK> existential observations on the <UNK> of time and <UNK> about <UNK> beyond the sunset of the world if that isn't grade <UNK> what is br br of course along with everything else the music is sublime it is frequently noted that alfred newman and bernard <UNK> created one of the <UNK> most compelling scores perfectly <UNK> yet each theme is well developed with a life of its own newman pressed for time by called in <UNK> someone he could trust <UNK> to take up half the burden br br benny not the <UNK> guy to work with obviously respected newman enough to really deliver inspiring music they <UNK> <UNK> an ingenious approach no spoilers as to who did what here but benny brings an edge with him mysterious awesome sounds alfred brings longing <UNK> both are <UNK> epic even when seen on a <UNK> tv print the effect of seeing the two <UNK> names side by side in the main credits which the ultra wide <UNK> screen could <UNK> <UNK> is spine <UNK> br br leon <UNK> the dean of <UNK> does not let us down here the lurid <UNK> and moody shadows probably <UNK> in all the terrible tv <UNK> i've seen through the years perfectly <UNK> the multi dimensional script by the great philip dunne and wb vet <UNK> robinson whom <UNK> must've brought with him to 20th how remarkable it is that <UNK> who was as much of an institution of cinematography at fox as newman was with music would lens a few years later but in the <UNK> <UNK> images of '60s todd a o these old studio guys are really heroes of mine br br to me who wants to <UNK> about all the <UNK> and criticism opportunities in a picture like this i'd rather <UNK> entirely to its spell and dive off into its sea of <UNK> to emerge after the inspiring climax of 'the <UNK> <UNK> moved and hungry for more br br and yes we should cry out to 20th fox for a dvd release worthy of legacy
<START> well the first thing i saw after looking at the dvd box was best screenplay and thought this would be a good rental wow was i mistaken i'm sure at one time there was a good movie in here but after the incredibly poor acting and video game production values this ends up looking like retarded half brother the first scene sets up the overall atmosphere of the entire movie five minutes into it you'll be asking yourself what the hell am i watching and it will just <UNK> from there an awful soundtrack that makes every song sound like rob <UNK> rounds out this miserable piece of crap into a laughably bad movie on a side note 3 most romantic quote in a movie i think you're the final destination
<START> in the real world of art elizabeth is the sexy drama queen every guy wants to do but no guy wants to wake up next to her on screen <UNK> christina <UNK> is the ugly artsy wannabe girl that desperately wants every and any guy but no guy will touch her that's why in <UNK> nation the <UNK> 2001 film of 1990s <UNK> book of the same name there are immediate problems ok the problems start before the miscast of <UNK> who has the emotional range of a is it any wonder that by far her finest acting was in the two <UNK> family films first off she is bizarre looking with big eyes and a <UNK> <UNK> making her look like the <UNK> from 2001 a space odyssey secondly she always plays <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> is the way films try to make it appear any guy would be attracted to her in one scene in the film her pal ruby michelle williams and liz walk through <UNK> and all the <UNK> <UNK> are <UNK> at <UNK> not the super cute and sexy williams reality check <UNK> this material <UNK> for the andy <UNK> treatment here is his version of the film a five minute shot of a <UNK> <UNK> a five minute shot of hairy a five minute shot of her sleeping naked and stoned on the bed she rises gives the middle finger to the audience cue credits see less than twenty minutes to <UNK> whole life and oh yeah <UNK> film would not have cast <UNK> even michelle williams would have been better and after seeing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i'd take anything williams or any other babe had to offer me <UNK> <UNK> is almost the kiss of death for a film and how she stays working is a mystery think of her performances in mediocre to bad films like monster sleepy hollow and woody allen's anything else also co starring jason <UNK> and now picture another actress in her role and immediately the films could seem better if not great she is the female counterpart to banal wooden <UNK> actors like tom cruise and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> ron howard and his <UNK> only had one job to do follow the <UNK> of the book which was rich mysterious moving and highly cinematic in its approach br br what they did they changed everything and i mean everything what is left is something that has no right being called angels br br i really love the book and find it very hard to see it being treated this way br br i wonder what was the opinion of dan brown himself for this film br br i really have no patience to sit down and right the 1 000 000 changes they made it is pointless
<START> simply an amazing bittersweet movie that portrays a side of life often <UNK> over in feel good movies i saw this as a child and came back to it very recently and fell in love again br br as a child it <UNK> my interest purely for the building of a plane as an adult it captured me in the dark world and a young mans escape from that world br br the portrayal of the king was great the camera style chosen with low shots and shots focusing on actions and hand movements was i thought well done i personally can not recall anything quite done in that style and adds to the character and portrays him as a force almost not human which may not be far from reality it makes for interesting developments br br worth a watch any day
<START> before last call w carson <UNK> my local nbc <UNK> aired much more worthwhile programming after late night w conan such as second city tv 3rd rock from the sun in the city reruns and some stand up comedy these days there is nothing worthwhile to watch because all i get to see is carson <UNK> and his awful show he is not a comedian he is not an actor he does not deserve to be famous because he isn't a good <UNK> nor comedian br br on his june 21st show he tried to use an internet called the on his show he failed hard that event <UNK> that carson <UNK> is awful
<START> oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all time the best word to describe it is genius the writing the acting the story lines everything about this show is absolutely amazing br br i just discovered the show and i became addicted to it right away and i was really surprised that it hasn't gotten the recognition it truly deserves it is violent and most of the characters aren't meant for you to like them but the show is written in such a brilliant way that allows you to look past the violence and the criminals and see them as real people they are the lowest forms of <UNK> but it still finds a way to allow you to understand a lot of the characters and even care about their stories br br the violence in the show is necessary for it to be as realistic as possible but the show isn't about the violence like some people might believe it really is a work of art and i'm sure who ever gives it a chance will love it just as much as i do
<START> i remember watching an elizabeth <UNK> movie when i was maybe 5 years old if that and to this day i can remember this movie in just bits and pieces it was the movie i remembered all throughout my life because i was <UNK> scared i think i remember the story part of it and the house constantly being dark the main part that was the most freaky to me was elizabeth walking around the house all dark and then there was someone in the field outside at the time i thought i was an old witch but the memory of it is now way <UNK> so i can't really remember who it was but it was someone definitely in a field outside lurking and that part is what freaked me out the most i really wish i could see this movie again if anyone knows how to get a copy please email me at <UNK> com
<START> i know curiosity killed the cat but i simply had to see the remake of psycho especially after being on such a <UNK> journey recently and knowing his work i've watched the original psycho though since i was a kid i knew how to respect it and not only that it was an excellent movie one of the best in fact the first thing i said when i heard about the remake was how do you remake perfection i stuck to that as well but i think i have a more open mind now and figured maybe it was a way of introducing psycho to a new generation br br but this turned into a total insult and slap to the face of the original psycho i know this has been said but i watched the making of this film and the director was like oh i just want to update it and shoot each scene shot by shot like the original what's the <UNK> point ok but i want to judge this movie on it's own despite it's insulting blows the original i mean the acting wasn't up to par but honestly it looked like the actors just watched the original and just <UNK> the lines from there and made it their crappy own br br watching the making of this film i wanted to slap anne she said i've never seen the original i just wanted to work with gus <UNK> that made me angry because frankly it's not just that she really sucked in this role as <UNK> she wasn't convincing not to mention her shower scene really was horrible vince vaughn didn't make let's just put it this way the film was horribly <UNK> this was a sin against film and on it's own this was actually a bad movie it was too much and destroyed what could've been a new introduction for a new generation but to gus leave the film making the one's who know what they're doing br br 1 10
<START> strange often effective hippie zombie flick starring the unforgettable husband wife team of alan and <UNK> this movie isn't as bad as most in its genre but is still way high on the cheese factor includes several bargain basement zombies outrageously campy dialogue a scene chewing performance by alan several gay kinky grave robbers and one soundtrack wife <UNK> puts on a performance that's so odd one has to wonder if she's really acting at all there are much worst <UNK> of this kind during the era look for any al <UNK> <UNK> but it's no night of the living dead director writer benjamin clark is really bob clark who went on to create the <UNK> <UNK> early 80's teen exploitation disasters he has only now <UNK> after 1 inexplicably good movie a christmas story to return to his dreadful ways with baby geniuses weirdo alan later wrote the kinky kinski malcolm mcdowell version of cat people <UNK> says check this <UNK> horror movie out for fun zombie <UNK> and campy dialogue 8
<START> everyone who worked on this film did an amazing job this is honestly one of the best lesbian films i've seen in a long time the acting writing cinematography music visuals everything was top notch as an avid fan of the genre both lesbian films and <UNK> i was so unbelievably pleased by this film it truly gave me so much more than i expected across the board hearing the q a with the cast and crew was great the lead actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and <UNK> it's a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what's really important and the writer did a hell of a job as well as directing and the editing was awesome thanks so much for making a great film thanks also for the line about <UNK> you're going to slap a label on yourself it would be i'm so tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both <UNK> get passed off as gay or straight it's wonderful to see getting recognition for existing and being part of the gay community and it was nice that <UNK> weren't even necessary at all in this film what an ending just when i thought it couldn't give me more it did beautiful work and my <UNK> to all i will spread the word this is definitely a film not to be missed
<START> drive was an enjoyable episode with a dark ending basically a man and his wife are infected in their inner ear by a high pitched sound wave being <UNK> by some military equipment some favorite parts of mine from this episode are <UNK> dialogue in the car and the scene where <UNK> goes in with the <UNK> team and find the little old deaf lady completely <UNK> by what they thought was a virus the ending of course is tragic in its realism because it leads the viewer to believe that they are going to actually be able to pull off this elaborate plan to save the victim but when <UNK> arrives the man is already dead 8 10
<START> <UNK> is the only word to describe this <UNK> awful production from the blatant disregard of the source material sure to <UNK> anyone remotely familiar with mythology to the predictably <UNK> production value this entire mini series is a train wreck br br the cast which includes some good actors whom i pity delivers the illogical dialogue in the same generic european accent so common to bad epics worse is the lack of originality in almost all other aspects from costume and set design <UNK> together styles from across time and space to the score which seems to poorly <UNK> many recognizable classical tunes as well as lord of the rings most offensive of all are the visual effects which single <UNK> prove that if you can't afford to do them well write them out br br it <UNK> me to see yet another legendary tale <UNK> by a cheap adaptation maybe one day someone will do it right
<START> house of the dead 2 dead aim 2005 is the sequel though you really don't need to see the first house of the dead to get this film that said the production value is definitely here with great zombie effects and it's edited quite nicely with very effective sound design however that said that's about all that's good here br br the story and script are awful there's blatant plot holes everywhere it's also funny how the soldiers don't mind if they get blood on their faces unlike in 28 days later where blood in any part of the body will <UNK> you also realistic how there's little order with the soldiers here unlike the usual us military discipline br br a 4 out of 10
<START> i've read that <UNK> inspiration for the consequences of love came from simply <UNK> a businessman alone in a brazilian hotel and <UNK> what he might be doing there the film unfolds to us in a similar way we view the existence of who has lived alone in a hotel in switzerland for 8 years he is <UNK> and avoids friendship his life is dominated by order and regularly gradually the truth of his existence is revealed to us until finally his world begins to fall apart br br the mystery of is central to the consequences of love and it works thanks in large part to the superb performance by toni his character becomes all the more intriguing to us as little details are revealed that he <UNK> heroin once a week that he has no imagination although some here <UNK> the dialogue for not being <UNK> that doesn't matter in my view this is not that sort of film and i think the script is great the camera work is also excellent br br if you have to <UNK> the film does lose its way a in the later scenes as the mystery of existence is revealed to us and as his world begins to fall apart however the tragic final scenes are every bit as good as the earlier build up
<START> i got a kick out of reynolds saying to his attorney look i've done a lot of <UNK> <UNK> thing in my life but i never killed anyone obviously he forgot about his career which <UNK> down hill after he started making stupid movies like run ' physical evidence was originally supposed to be a sequel to 'the <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> close rejected the verdict is in avoid physical evidence
<START> christian <UNK> directed this <UNK> little espionage thriller early in his career it plays on tv pretty regularly albeit with some terrific scenes of violence and sex unfortunately <UNK> i finally got around to seeing the theatrical version on a 3 tape from the local video store naval officer <UNK> quinn is <UNK> to <UNK> the notorious carlos the and gets a little too caught up in the role donald sutherland ben kingsley play <UNK> superiors with sutherland a true <UNK> and kingsley as the more level headed one the first half of this fun flick shows quinn being trained and <UNK> the second half has him out in the field making love to the woman and shooting it out with <UNK> enemies the idea is to make the look like a <UNK> to the russians and let them take care of the world's most notorious assassin things don't exactly play out as planned at times i almost expected the cast to break out laughing at some of the corny dialogue but they all play it very straight in the end this is one terrific little thriller that deserves your attention the former mistress teaching the highly proper and very married quinn to rough her up <UNK> blood from her face and then go down on her alone is worth the price of admission
<START> i saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline i go to the movies as an escape to leave everything behind and enjoy a story i found this to be a good movie not great but good it was worth my money and my tears br br diane lane was wonderful as always richard gere isn't an over actor he held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect he brings his own style to the movie br br i think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told it was messy and they had other <UNK> but they wanted to be together and wanted to wait for each other br br i'd definitely recommend it
<START> this bright hilarious english comedy about school girl antics is a neglected gem the significant question is where is the audience the film is rated 10 by most voters but how many voters is that they don't make comedies like this anymore because the films don't get distributed or seen i would never miss a chance to see this old art house classic again but where are the art houses
<START> just when you think that you've seen the worst the zombie sub genre can offer along comes another budding romero and his team of no talent mates to prove you wrong br br i've suffered the zombie bloodbath trilogy endured death valley the revenge of bloody bill sat semi <UNK> through the zombie <UNK> and laughed hysterically during zombie <UNK> extreme <UNK> and genuinely thought that amateur movie making could sink no lower however having just watched zombie planet a two hour long <UNK> pile of drivel from writer director george i think i have found the ultimate in awful zombie movies br br in this dreadfully amateurish effort which is part mad max and part dawn of the dead but all bad frank stars as t k kane a tough fighter who kicks zombie ass for a <UNK> armed only with knives a <UNK> some <UNK> <UNK> and what he obviously <UNK> to be a really mean <UNK> br br after a desperately <UNK> opening sequence in which he takes on a <UNK> of dodgy looking zombies kane teams up with a group of survivors who not only have to <UNK> off attacks from the undead but must also must <UNK> a gang of vicious thugs who have taken control of the area by searching for and <UNK> over any <UNK> that they find br br of course kane isn't the type of man to take orders from a bunch of z grade post apocalyptic bully boys and he sets about teaching the bad guys a lesson mostly by at them in a threatening manner only <UNK> to <UNK> rescue pals from zombies br br featuring awful acting from almost everyone involved a dreadful script laughable effects and shoddy production values there is virtually nothing in this film to make it worth a watch to be fair i quite like the basic premise that the zombies are the unexpected result of a highly popular drug that <UNK> <UNK> for we learn this when one character conveniently explains the back story to kane who strangely has no idea what has happened but this is about the only vaguely interesting aspect of the whole production br br i have a certain amount of respect for anyone who manages to <UNK> and make their own movie but when the results are this poor that respect is lost when they decide to make it available for public viewing i would've kept this one under <UNK> if i had made it
<START> well i like to watch bad horror b movies cause i think it's interesting to see stupidity and <UNK> of creators to shoot seriously good movie i always compare this movies to for example some spielberg's works and again and again don't understand the huge difference in what i see i like ed <UNK> movies cause it's so inept it's very funny but people the chilling is not funny and is not even interesting it's extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable there's no acting no screenplay no direction no thrills and not even blood it's extremely inept amateurish film it's definitely the worst movie i had ever seen and i had seen a lot of worst movies believe me i warned you 1 10
<START> this isn't a good movie plain and simple take out the hardcore sex scenes and what you have is a mediocre plot average acting at best plodding direction and dull dialogue add in the <UNK> and you've got mediocre plot average acting plodding direction dull dialogue with <UNK> of hardcore porn trouble is the nothing special either so it's not a good movie and nor is it a good porno it fails on both counts they can say that women made this movie and they were <UNK> to do this with it and that with it etc but cheap the end result is what counts and what we have here is a mediocre movie with some sex thrown in for shock value to try and con you into wasting your time watching it one of those movies where you'd rather have the time you spent watching it back
<START> x is a beautiful adaption of herman <UNK> or the the comments on here surprise me it makes me wonder what has led to the <UNK> negative reaction br br the shock value is the least appealing thing about this film a minor detail that has been blown out of <UNK> the story is of downfall and the subsequent destruction of those around him which is overtly demonstrated in his features <UNK> and the dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from any other i have seen and turn a <UNK> traditional storyline with controversial twists into an <UNK> emotional epic br br i can't stress enough the importance of <UNK> everything you have heard about this film and watching as i did with an open mind you will i hope be rewarded in the same way that i was i felt on edge and nervous from around the half hour mark however the film is far from scary in any traditional sense it will leave you with 1 000 thoughts each of them at once <UNK> and thrilling i know i'm <UNK> here but i feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film it's the best i've seen all year
<START> it's a sad state in corporate hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking <UNK> you've been seeing in the movie house since day one i had literally no idea how this film was going to end because it went left when i expected it to go right when i expected a <UNK> etc this could have easily <UNK> into generic suspense thriller or depressing white trash drama but it stayed a course all its own till the end it is a sad story though not because of what happens to alice but because of the sad world that <UNK> her and leads her down this path br br the plot has a quiet dignity of form that's usually reserved for theater but the pacing could use some <UNK> up either way it's a very good film and for some reason i suspect sour <UNK> from those who have scored this one low
<START> how often do we live our romantic life as on the big screen with <UNK> affairs and passionate encounters almost never if what i see as normal life around me is anything to judge by romances as previously stated are hardly ever <UNK> affairs that leave you at the top of the world or <UNK> and <UNK> br br romance in its every day form as lived out millions of times over around the world is a slow subtle and quiet affair something that grows in you ever so slowly probably without you even <UNK> it slowly taking over your being no one can tell me when i am in love for if someone did i would not believe him anyway for no one but me would know and even then it is just a feeling a certain knowledge that you are feeling this emotion that you want nothing but the best for someone that you would never want to see them suffer a moment of sadness that you are willing to take a great degree of pain for them i would not go so far as to say be willing to die for your loved one for we are all human and we do not know what we are capable of in the face of death until that moment is upon us br br is the love between the main characters of the film ever so subtle and understated no less noble than that between romeo and juliet the <UNK> emotions the <UNK> feelings convey far more than any repeated shouts of i love you the restraint shown by the lead actor displayed ever so <UNK> in the scene where he watches his love interest through the <UNK> window yet never did he move to make himself known to her was simply heart wrenching to watch would most of us be <UNK> enough to remain hidden knowing that her emotions and feelings could not possibly be <UNK> br br on another note how will i deal with my own certain death while i can claim i have been seriously ill i can not in all honesty say that i have ever come close to death will i be so calm putting all my affairs in order and leaving <UNK> for others to take up what i leave behind i suspect i will be calm for i will have little choice in the matter can i be so <UNK> again the answer will have to be in the negative i can empathize with the anguish knowing that your life is <UNK> that fate has dealt you a fatal blow and that future events however little there are of them left are no longer under your control br br life is nothing more than a series of small events the <UNK> of which may seem great for some in retrospect but only very rarely
<START> the screaming is a very low budget horror movie that was shot on video it features passable acting poor lighting a weak story and some of the worst monster effects i've ever seen the plot has a college student being <UNK> to join a cult by his attractive <UNK> the cult is a parody of <UNK> with a book similar to this would have been a funny shot at that group were it not for a dumb script and the <UNK> of the production the monster effects look awful and the picture quality makes it feel like you're watching a home video or a public service <UNK> i think anyone who sees this will agree that movies should be shot on film
<START> did someone find the plot somewhere in the film perhaps it is the thing missing in this pretentious exercise of cinema about cinema it is quite surprising that gordon says that a movie without a plot is nothing it is possible that characters have more to say that the own <UNK> <UNK> was this phrase in the original plot or the actor decided to send a hint to the director
<START> earnest effort which achieves some success to adapt the classic odyssey story to a <UNK> nostalgia period piece the <UNK> this time are escaped <UNK> wandering about the depression <UNK> south <UNK> their way into trouble br br the greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack effectively <UNK> not only the era that this is set in but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film besides its value to the tone of the movie the music is just plain fun to listen to br br what <UNK> the film is that the characters really aren't that likable in a comedy you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their <UNK> instead we have a bunch of selfish arrogant soulless mean spirited <UNK> who really have no positive points at all they're not <UNK> enough to make you hate them either so it's hard to relate to them at all they're offered up as <UNK> but like people who put clown makeup on and march in <UNK> they just aren't funny br br like the story that inspired it the movie takes these guys on an odyssey <UNK> a variety of symbolic some even mystical characters everybody is <UNK> with offensive stereotypes the <UNK> word being stupid people are <UNK> right and left and consequently no one is left being particularly interesting or appealing the movie doesn't like its own characters and it doesn't let you like them either br br <UNK> beautiful <UNK> stolen cars <UNK> radio people being whipped with sticks all are thrown at you in disjointed fashion some evoke a few laughs others confuse or bore you i did laugh when a nerdy guy beat the <UNK> out of an especially obnoxious lead character but there were a lot more <UNK> gratuitous scenes an example some <UNK> dillinger type guy <UNK> with a tommy gun comedy symbolism no just mindless violence which <UNK> from the intellectual nature of the original source material this story draws upon br br other adaptations of the odyssey are much better unless you're a george clooney fan rent something else but buy the soundtrack cd the music is great
<START> i heard what people were saying but i ignored them being rushed at blockbuster i grabbed copy of this movie and ran out br br 45 minutes into i was fighting to stay awake there is some attempt to keep the film interesting but it was just bad a chase of some sort takes place but it was long and drawn out the perfect time to make a <UNK> by the time this movie was over i didn't care how ended i just wanted it to end walking in and out of my room checking to see if it was over br br the entire movie is a <UNK> the characters and their relationships the plot twists are predictable as well as the ending the actors made the best out of really terrible roles all can say is their clothes were nice but the movie it was just bad
<START> i like tom hanks and he is one of few actors who will draw me into the theatre regardless of any <UNK> i may have concerning the film i worried about mr hanks return to light comedy as this is the <UNK> where he made the transition from tv to film remember big well charlie <UNK> war is not light comedy it is political satire and extremely well written political satire at that the script is the star of this film and the word by aaron is some of the best on offer this year br br mike holds the entire <UNK> together delivering a film that <UNK> along in a very quick 90 minutes timing is everything in comedy and nothing is ever funny if it drags choice in sets and lighting are also very reminiscent of <UNK> and <UNK> tv a move used deliberately to root the piece in period br br the return to the use of model work and stock photography over digital special effects also enhances the retro look and believability note to the production <UNK> in your choice of stock footage i know the difference between an f 16 and a and a bell and a <UNK> but that may have been part of the joke too br br i saw this film in philadelphia it was interesting to watch and listen to the audience not get the historical references to their own history history tends to repeat because the have forgotten what happened the first time around br br kudos to both mr hanks and that <UNK> phillip <UNK> hoffman script is brought to life by these actors and the entire production team is on the top of their game br br <UNK> recommended
<START> this film is a study piece for my english class but it's depth and meaning has amazed me since we're looking closely into all the facts and characters in this film its and interesting tale of love hate war and prejudice well recommended br br story a girl named well off jewish patty <UNK> meets an escaped prisoner of war she then hides him in her <UNK> in her huge gardens and as they get to know each other they begin to see the others qualities and they earn each others love <UNK> father <UNK> her and treats her like dirt anton the prisoner of war almost blows his cover to protect her but patty manages to stop him before he is seen by anyone
<START> this moving was intriguing and absorbing however the story was a little choppy and hard to follow at times although the two principal actors did a great job just seeing penn acting with every <UNK> of his being and stealing every frame made this a very memorable movie later movies have revealed him to be a not just one role actor he also showed comedic flair in sweet and <UNK> surprisingly talented and not the light weight i used to think he was
<START> it is is very sad to see someone of the <UNK> of george c scott in a low budget thriller which would have been better if the original novel was written by graham greene and directed by someone somewhat more experienced in the genre not to mention a better cinematographer there are so many missed opportunities with the scenery and carnival merely <UNK> over rather than captured to locate the movie <UNK> in the exotic setting of the novel br br elsewhere in the viewer comments on this site one very <UNK> <UNK> complained about the variety of <UNK> bad accents in this film ever since i saw george c scott as rochester in jane eyre i have <UNK> for him never to ever accept again a role which required him to assume a british accent just every now and then he could just possibly pass for british or a very british sounding south african played obviously by an american actor i can stomach meryl <UNK> extraordinarily <UNK> accents both british and australian at least she gets it right even though with every <UNK> she demands that we marvel at her skill well i am sorry that mr scott is no meryl streep and it just destroys the illusion like having <UNK> <UNK> speak excruciating <UNK> with a strong <UNK> accent in <UNK> tiger etc br br peterson acts no differently than what we see on <UNK> except he is still very handsome and more or less slim in this movie he is the harrison ford of tv same old expressions for every emotion every situation no on second thought ford has two <UNK> <UNK> and happy i have never seen a smile on mr <UNK>
<START> <UNK> the anime tv series has so far <UNK> 2 feature length theatre movies and a third one is coming our way this summer br br the first one which was released in the summer <UNK> was a fun adventure featuring the main characters of <UNK> in an exciting adventure however one must be a blind deaf and one <UNK> chicken to deny that film's faults whilst the first was most definitely enjoyable there were a lot of things that could be improved on <UNK> movie 2 however takes all of these aspects and excels upon them br br the action first of all was incredibly cinematic the lighting setting and style was three <UNK> as effective as in the first movie in the first we were given basic action well animated and choreographed animation but nothing eye popping however this movie's cinematography was exceptional the use of shadows and lighting combining together to make the action all that more intense was very effective and added to the force of the fighting br br the animation was very good it <UNK> disney however since this is a movie about tv characters there was nothing about the character design or detail to the actual characters however the animation was incredibly fluid and realistic i think they even used twice the amount of <UNK> for each second because there was absolutely nothing <UNK> about the animation at all it was incredibly fluid br br the music i think that's where this movie fails the original composer conductor for the tv show was used for the film and i don't really feel that he did that good of a job the music mostly reminded me of a lot of pieces used in old games the composer is very good but the used for the film couldn't convey the tune very well however they didn't fail the film at all adding as a good <UNK> to the action but except for a few <UNK> string pieces towards the end and some <UNK> work the music didn't <UNK> any boundaries or act as anything special br br the story was fun it was a reasonably typical storyline for <UNK> and was very similar to the first movies except again it took everything that had been wrong with the first film's story and improved upon them the characters were a lot more interesting and the way the story progressed was what kept me watching throughout the entire film it kept making you think the film would be ending any second now but then it would move on but instead of feeling dragged out the action and characters made everything still feel fresh and exciting br br overall this film is a but however good it might be it is most definitely one for the fans i enjoyed the film but thats because i'm a fan but i can see just like with final <UNK> <UNK> children it doesn't <UNK> as a movie but merely acts as a fantastic serve of fan service for a good hour and a half though i think this film does act as a good introduction to the series for current non <UNK> it won't give a full effect for anyone other than those glued to <UNK> screens however despite all this it was a fun movie to enjoy during this depressing period of <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i like <UNK> coward the wit i like <UNK> coward the play write i like <UNK> coward the composer and singer but i <UNK> <UNK> coward the actor br br to me this is a man who should have stayed firmly behind the scenes writing his plays and <UNK> his music and making his profound and hilarious observations he should never have been allowed in front of a camera br br make no mistake he is one of the top outstanding talents of the 20th century but the man just couldn't act and his voice with it's rolling <UNK> and it's overly round <UNK> quality well it could quite easily <UNK> cheese in my opinion br br this is one of my least favourite offerings from coward as he <UNK> portrays a psychiatrist <UNK> on an affair with a much younger woman made worse by the fact that the much younger woman is an old school friend of his much younger wife br br <UNK> johnson is as much a joy to watch as ever as <UNK> <UNK> wife it is her performance that saves this film from <UNK> <UNK> i suppose her own little <UNK> in <UNK> brief encounter four years previously <UNK> her for this role as she must have raised a few <UNK> playing a such a <UNK> woman and this gave her the chance to win back a few fans and gain some lost sympathy br br she was such a wonderful actress and you can see why <UNK> coward used her so much in many of his productions br br however the rest of the film is drab badly acted predictable and on the whole boring to almost <UNK> <UNK> level br br if its <UNK> coward you want then take the time to watch in which we serve <UNK> spirit or this happy breed instead three <UNK> coward <UNK> with lovely films like these i suppose we can forgive him for this turkey br br i have given this four stars purely for the addition of miss johnson but on the whole i'd avoid this one like the plague
<START> during my struggle to stay awake during this <UNK> i fought through my near off to discover some silly plot regarding <UNK> <UNK> quite incredibly <UNK> annoying running into trouble with a psychotic damaged half human half cyborg named splatter who sends his soldiers after them for the murder of their <UNK> politically vocal leader for whom splatter killed himself setting them up to take the blame so he could become the leader these face painted freaks form a group who express their feelings though non violently living on <UNK> streets abandoned by the <UNK> world <UNK> their concerns regarding nuclear <UNK> anyways most of the film has these five frat <UNK> running throughout <UNK> streets with <UNK> walls as splatter and his <UNK> pursue them thankfully for these guys they find a punk <UNK> to assist them on their journey out of this rather ugly <UNK> with which they're this territory the frat guys are immersed is a <UNK> <UNK> of streets and <UNK> with the idea of an exit out most difficult particularly when <UNK> and bunch <UNK> nearly every turn br br yeah i was <UNK> like others thanks to the <UNK> <UNK> poster which is most excellent if only he had been the designer of this dreck this is not the case and we the viewer are left a film <UNK> after of all movies it seems walter <UNK> the warriors except this film doesn't have the style or <UNK> that film has the film has a <UNK> of unfunny bits and lame <UNK> between the <UNK> and the <UNK> with hand to hand <UNK> often laughable the setting is rather interesting and there are some atmospheric uses of <UNK> light but it's not the environment that's the problem it's the plot and characters within the environment that grow tiresome the under my eyes <UNK> <UNK> every minute this movie continued yes texas chainsaw stars <UNK> <UNK> quite a funny voice man who has an entertaining interview on the dvd i rented for this <UNK> turd of a film and marilyn burns have key roles as <UNK> members of their <UNK> against the government resulting in the final conclusion within a building complex at the end character splatter uses these metal <UNK> which emerge from his metal arm to kill his victims
<START> the only good either of the problem child films caused was bringing together amy <UNK> and the late john ritter aside from that the flicks are as demonic as their hero in this basically unnecessary sequel <UNK> separated ben ritter and his little <UNK> junior michael oliver who never needs screen time ever again move to a new town <UNK> with willing ben eventually picks played by the most underused original snl er <UNK> newman whose <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> don't suit junior in the least to add on to <UNK> torture it seems this town already has a little <UNK> in younger girl form with <UNK> who <UNK> has a sweet single mother played by <UNK> the same actress who played <UNK> first horrible mother through <UNK> you can see where the plot goes from here searching for my favorite scene is like pulling teeth so i guess i'll go with the <UNK> bomb in the toilet gag that makes back to the <UNK> james one of the many grown up victims that guy's always playing school authority figures jack warden and gilbert <UNK> return as their parts from the first film but sadly there is no appearance from the bow tie er i mean killer michael richards that made problem child all the more fun on a serious note i'm sure these films whether abusive parents saw them or no did wonders for the red headed children of america let us also <UNK> these proud american flicks for their terrific promoting of <UNK> oh and dog <UNK> jokes gotta have dog <UNK> jokes
<START> the <UNK> days of your life showcases some of <UNK> greatest comedy talents of its time in a <UNK> <UNK> and upper class <UNK> like fashion generally it is a <UNK> stop tour of <UNK> english behaviour with the girls only school providing a great setting for the <UNK> goings on margaret <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and most especially <UNK> are all fantastic giving us a lot of laughs as they express their utter horror at what they are having to deal with as the film moves on things get <UNK> and <UNK> with the tour around the school for the parents being a suitably <UNK> high point br br at this point i will give special mention again to <UNK> and her wonderful character miss she is so extraordinarily innocent silly <UNK> and <UNK> that she seems to steal the whole film she provides the greatest laugh of the film when she <UNK> with a male teacher call me <UNK> br br whilst some of the film is slow or dated and not always very involving it still maintains most of its <UNK> and barely pauses for romance good for a silly harmless giggle br br 7 10
<START> i <UNK> agree with greg in <UNK> i saw this movie today with a friend who actually went to the theatre manager afterwards and told him that was possibly the worst movie i have ever seen i have seen a lot of movies with this person and he's pretty <UNK> so i was actually shocked the manager gave him a free pass br br i was offended by much of the humor in the film yes the baked <UNK> scene was on the top of the list my friend and i are white and saw the film with a primarily black audience for awhile i thought maybe i just don't get this movie because i'm white then i realized no one was laughing the writing was bad the direction was bad the timing was almost non existent br br there were a few funny moments there was just way too much time between them even airplane two was funnier than this and that's saying a lot br br i was so <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> and <UNK> as <UNK> bear that i felt i was sure to enjoy this movie nope br br was funny as usual but his role was rather small tom arnold had a few funny moments as the white guy but most other attempts at humor fell far short of the mark br br sadly i was not able to award this film a rating with negative stars
<START> hilarious clean light hearted and quote worthy what else can you ask for in a film this is my all time number one favorite movie ever since i was a little girl i've <UNK> of <UNK> a blue van with flames and an observation bubble br br the clich√© characters in ridiculous situations are what make this film such great fun the wonderful comedic chemistry between stephen <UNK> harold and andy <UNK> make up most of my favorite parts of the movie and who didn't love the hopeless <UNK> of don't forget the airport antics of <UNK> <UNK> dressed up as <UNK> dancing <UNK> and playing the <UNK> <UNK> the clues are genius the locations are classic and the plot is timeless br br a word to the wise if you didn't watch this film when you were little it probably won't win a place in your heart today but nevertheless give it a chance you may find that it doesn't matter what you say it doesn't matter what you do you've gotta play
<START> ok we have 4 city <UNK> who find a mini <UNK> <UNK> turn it in and fall into a parallel universe inhabited by a giant spider queen also from a parallel universe who managed to slip through with a few of her <UNK> to take over the earth but alas she is the only one left if so why did not the rest of humanity join up and hunt her down also what happened to the military no way a few billion plus round of <UNK> could have been used up and why hide out in a basement when a lot more <UNK> places had to available also not a dig on city workers but how is it they knew what a mini <UNK> <UNK> looked like and how if they did not have one in the parallel universe could they <UNK> the <UNK> sorry but there was nothing likable about the movie
<START> ed <UNK> an editor is hired to cut horror films down to be <UNK> in europe where standards are much more <UNK> but he finds the films very mind destroying and starts going a little bit mad okay a little bit might be an understatement br br let me just say this first of all best opening scene ever a man in an office who blows up his head with a <UNK> his boss then says with a straight face you're fired the entire film does not keep up this level of intensity but it certainly tries br br take the shotgun scenes the <UNK> the clips from lost limbs which my friend jason wishes were a real film the writer of this film thought up the idea of a woman who gets raped by a <UNK> and then immediately after gets shot in the face with a <UNK> that is something you won't find in any other movie at least i'm pretty <UNK> you will br br this film's biggest flaw is the quality the picture isn't as crisp as a 1997 film should be and the sound could be touched up though it's not bad i thought i was watching a 1980s film although that gave it a bit of a boost in my mind the film also had the 1980s style of writing and directing in it a sense of fun and giving the audience a little something extra over the top i do miss those days br br i wish i had more to say though at the moment i cannot think of anything strong enough to praise this film i do think you ought to see this you've seen the box in your video store with the <UNK> splitting the head maybe you've passed it up a few times maybe you thought it would be cheesy pick it up <UNK> it
<START> this film is so bad i mean who <UNK> this stuff and the costume designer deserves an award for making everyone look like they had just stepped out of 1983 a bloke puts a female wig on and fights <UNK> said
<START> i've seen a few of mr <UNK> movies and didn't like much of them not that they are bad movies quite the contrary are good movies but not content i personally found entertaining however i think where the heart is although made to <UNK> to the less than art <UNK> american audience is masterful as satire and as social commentary of the times it was made in i've had to replace this movie in my collection at least a half a dozen times since every time i <UNK> it out to someone i know could appreciate it's artistry on all its levels my copy fails to come back home to me lol the last time took 7 years to replace it since it was out of print for vhs sales has never been made as a dvd that i know of and had to wait till one of the <UNK> cable channels ran it before i could tape it again br br my favorite aspect after the nail on the head social commentary is the paintings by i've searched for 15 years to find anyone or anywhere that could lead me to where her work is available for sale or better yet a copy of the paintings in the movie without the ending credits rolling over them i have a room in my house that i dedicated to putting copies of her paintings in and no one seems to know if it ever was released as a coffee table book or video <UNK> or as a documentary of her work if anyone does know of where i can <UNK> any sort of copy of work or where her studio is in england please do not hesitate to contact me via email
<START> after seeing this routine by john <UNK> i finally realize why he is such a talent i enjoy great stage work and this is stage work at its best i cannot label it as a stand up routine because <UNK> is so intense when playing the different characters the only time he breaks character is when it is necessary for him to complete his part in which he does so <UNK> that you cannot help but appreciate his talents i wasn't really sure how i felt about him as an actor but freak <UNK> my appreciation of him for those out there that have not had the opportunity to see this show i feel for you definitely check it out it is one of the nest routines i have ever seen ranks with eddie murphy bill <UNK> and chris rock four stars and more
<START> this movie is based on the series street fighter <UNK> or zero it is placed in an other setting than <UNK> the animated movie this movie is all about <UNK> who is accompanied by ken and <UNK> li i recognized rose and <UNK> there weren't any other characters used from the video game that i could discover the fighting scenes were ok but nothing really spectacular and there were not many of them to me this is odd isn't <UNK> about fighting <UNK> the animated movie 1994 is far superior to this movie it tries to be more than it really is the use of the power and other supernatural have nothing to do with skills the characters have in the video game and in this case that is a bad thing the story is so boring that you don't really care what is happening the action is toned down considerably why and what happened to the other characters from the video game surely they are more interesting than the villain in this story the main attraction of the video game are the characters with their own special skills in this movie it is all about <UNK> that is why this anime fails
<START> this is the kind of movie that could have ruined several careers if garbage could ruin motion picture careers these days br br <UNK> griffith took off her shirt and in her pre <UNK> surgery days she really should have stayed dressed br br jeff daniels was completely wasted but fortunately for him and for us he has gone on to much better things since this this this well heck piece of garbage br br strangely all of its major players have gone on to bigger and better things including director jonathan <UNK> his work here was also wasted but deserving of a <UNK> admiration i mean anything not worth doing is not worth doing well but he did it well anyway br br still there was one bright shining aspect ray liotta who is named way down the credit list just absolutely stole everything liotta was <UNK> mesmerizing hypnotic enthralling br br i saw this piece of garbage while it was still relatively new in a friend's private theater for some strange reason my friend loved it i sort of think it's because <UNK> griffith took off her shirt and really honest she shouldn't have though he tried to claim it was other more artistic reasons br br anyway i thought even then after his first scene that ray liotta would become a major star or at least a major highly respected actor br br despite the aspects of the script the sheer <UNK> of the whole story liotta made it almost worth watching in fact it is worth seeing once just to see how far ray liotta has come i mean for one thing his name is now usually listed at or near the top br br even then even in a pile of garbage ray liotta <UNK> like a diamond br br just if you do see this trash be prepared to hold your nose every major character is either amoral or <UNK> terrible movie terrible movie idea br br added comment too many people answer was this comment helpful with a no because they disagree with the expressed opinion maybe imdb should ask that question instead do you agree with these opinions
<START> ok if you are looking for a fun lesbian romp this is not the movie if you are looking for a fun movie with hot <UNK> characters in the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> this is not the movie if you are looking for a classic vampire lesbian movie this is not the movie br br however if you are looking to <UNK> an hour of your life this is your movie it is badly written badly directed badly scored badly filmed it had bad special effects i mean really bad special effects i think that you can actually generate the same special effects in <UNK> lol br br it really is a pretty bad movie br br the actors were classic <UNK> <UNK> however look more like porn stars it is shot like a soft core porn however you never get the money shot and the actors all look bored out of their brains the <UNK> on <UNK> scenes which suck btw were so lame that there hardly worth mentioning go watch the <UNK> sex <UNK> on youtube <UNK> that's the only reason you would want to watch this movie and even there not worth it br br a <UNK> of money and time don't even pick it up go watch <UNK> intentions <UNK> instead same movie without the bad special effects bad storyline bad writing bad dialog and bad acting actually i might go watch it now just to <UNK> my mind
<START> one of the many backwoods <UNK> that came out in the early and fortunately this is one of the better ones yes it has a cheesy plot but i was pleasantly surprised at this film because i thought it was really good and really entertaining although the killer could have been made a bit more scarier he just looked like a fat <UNK> br br first of all we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell he is who warns them not to go to those mountains as they are very dangerous but when the teens arrive it doesn't seem very dangerous at all well according to me anyway it's a shame that we don't get movies like this any longer and if we do it's usually some boring terrible film br br this movie more relies on tension and being scary than gore because the gore factor is really low in this movie which i wasn't pleased with but other than that it's still a great movie br br all in all you'll have to search long and hard to find this movie and if you do find it you will like it and also watch out for ending with the final girl and the killer it's totally not what you'd expect
<START> why are there so many songs about <UNK> and what's on the other side <UNK> poses this relatively simple double near the beginning of the muppet movie while singing his signature song the <UNK> connection as time goes by the question and the movie only gain <UNK> br br i'm going to <UNK> the review of this movie as a children's comedy but look at it instead as a classic for every generation to love with serious ideals and a heartwarming message that <UNK> more warmth with each passing year br br as the <UNK> in my own life come <UNK> up on me i hear more and more the <UNK> <UNK> of that <UNK> <UNK> and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to anyone's life because we all dream and that is what this movie is about it's not just a bunch of puppets it's a bunch of puppets having the strength to pursue their dreams which is a good lesson for everyone br br and while the humor and <UNK> of the film always feel good they're not a fair judge of the movie only the <UNK> connection and the powerful emotions it will realize and it all fits in <UNK> connection is the muppet movie and vice versa it's <UNK> meets children's entertainment there's no simpler way to describe it
<START> this piece of garbage belongs in the basement of some <UNK> old mansion where it will never see the light of day again the only thing scary about this junk was the price of admission i was only amused when the ending credits started rolling and i was free to <UNK> the <UNK> what an <UNK> bore a complete waste of 1 and a half hours when i die i pray i can come back as a ghost and give a fever to the moron who penned this <UNK>
<START> when one of the stars of a movie is named <UNK> you should know enough to stay away stay away house 2 is just more of the same this time with zombies <UNK> a college campus man how that must have saved on money as usual the zombies are given no direction so speak of and provided very little makeup or <UNK> they look like the zombies in one of those endless italian zombie <UNK> from years ago which is to say they don't look like the kind of zombies we know and love from george romero and dan zombie flicks the folks battling the zombies are all who get to shoot guns and do little else some who have written here feel the sequel is slightly more focused than the original all i have to say is i'm glad the <UNK> director did away with the <UNK> degree pan shots that helped to ruin the first movie house 2 is still just more of the same which means a lot of nothing happens for 80 or 90 minutes there is one set piece involving soldiers with a zombie football team that might at least have been funny it's not
<START> ah i loved the book series and eagerly <UNK> each one in middle school and when i heard that there was a television adaptation i was very excited br br boy what a let down the final product was i think for me this was the moment when <UNK> stopped being about cool programming and more generic br br so what was wrong with the series let me count the ways 1 the characters were <UNK> miscast in the books the were somewhere between 12 14 the television cast were at least 18 i remember being horrified when i first saw the cast photos br br 2 horrific acting bad writing i <UNK> which was to blame so i'm <UNK> into the <UNK> mass that it was perhaps it was the fact that the <UNK> age of the cast <UNK> the humor that is at least cute coming out of a 13 year old because <UNK> not funny in fact i don't remember a single comical moment from the group and there were a few the actors were certainly not helped by the writing which was bland at its best and head pathetic at its worst br br 3 my lord they were <UNK> with the budget the final result of the alone should have convinced to pull the plug their heads had that clearly showed which was the helmet br br 4 back to the cast rachel by far was the biggest let down far from being the warrior woman in the books the best equivalent in the tv series was scarecrow also i know cassie was an <UNK> but there is a difference between <UNK> and idiot br br 5 one of the worst opening titles ever did the music have to be that obvious 6 answering question 6 yes because everything else was <UNK> down so why shouldn't the <UNK> less intelligent viewers receive a thick as a brick song from a lame rap rock rip off or whatever the hell that was br br since then there have been bigger let downs iraq 2004 but in case i haven't made myself clear this show sucked and was an abomination to the book series it was supposed to be based from
<START> bay area residents probably remember paul from the diamond center an <UNK> late night <UNK> who <UNK> easy credit and cheap rocks on late night television throughout the 1980s and early 90s i mention him only because there is an actor in death machines who looks just like him playing the owner of an italian restaurant he appears in the best scene in this positively dreadful and near unwatchable crime drama about a dragon lady <UNK> who wisely hung up her acting <UNK> after <UNK> this film who controls the local <UNK> our hero let's call him not paul from the diamond center plays the <UNK> with all the subtlety of the <UNK> <UNK> you da spaghetti and seems <UNK> when one of his <UNK> complains about the food no there's no fly in the soup or hair in the <UNK> there's a red <UNK> in the <UNK> the calling card of the murderous crime boss who sends a <UNK> to each of her <UNK> victims death machines is bad by any measure and pretty boring which is an even worse crime
<START> i was into the movie right away i've seen the other <UNK> movies with the exception of raising arizona and i've noticed that each of their movies has a color <UNK> is gray white <UNK> is bright orange and this movie is a pleasant yellow br br the bright pleasant qualities of this movie start right away soon the look is accompanied by the great great music it's the old folk sound the kind of music that was written during a time when music was enjoyed as a part of day to day life enjoyed by everyone chain gangs church <UNK> and even prison <UNK> br br now about the prison <UNK> i don't know what crime their characters could have possibly committed as they are a very very friendly group of guys clooney is fantastic completely <UNK> his role br br go see this as soon as possible i believe that it can be enjoyed by anyone at some level for some reason the theater i was in was full of old ladies and old men and they loved it br br you'll love it too i promise i was compelled to get my hands on the soundtrack right away
<START> please re watch all 3 series and do not go see this movie the trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series stretch a badly thought out tv episode into the most painful <UNK> of my life truly an awful film <UNK> and edward are in it for a few mins <UNK> has 1 line and her just <UNK> out the same tired old <UNK> also mr <UNK> accent just changes about 5 times in the film tons of badly acted extras and really a few laughs that they seem to <UNK> for 2 <UNK> i honestly feel this series has been completely ruined by this god awful piece of crap batman and robin all is forgiven
<START> i saw it on video predictable horrid acting film <UNK> what more can be said this movie sucks the actors are annoying to say the least this was suppose to be a comedy but there was only one funny moment other than that is was painful to watch for me br br 1 out of 10 pass
<START> i saw this film when it first came out and have never forgotten it my uncle <UNK> is much much greater than the sum of it's parts the movie loosely is about a pre adolescent who is sent to live with a relative in a small town in canada there are adventures that seem more or less typical but underneath there is a current building has a <UNK> pace but have patience the reward is coming i believe the film was sub titled and as with all non english speaking movies i've seen it is well worth avoiding any dubbed version inevitably dubbed movies reflect the attitudes of a new director and actors with the additional necessity of lip <UNK> lines that don't quite fit the english speaking is a travesty for example while the sub titled version sings my uncle <UNK> is well worth the time to find and watch it in french
<START> escape from hell is not made with enough artistry to disguise what it is crass exploitation the direction and writing are both sloppy for example the camera work during the fight between and wilson is so bad that you can barely make out what's happening also if the alcoholic but kind hearted doctor hadn't killed the warden the guards would never have followed him and the girls after their escape the fake plague plan had worked fine until then but he just had to ruin it i would have given this film a 4 out of 10 the <UNK> lesbian scene is not bad and christina <UNK> has an amazingly beautiful face and body but a particularly disgusting scene of abuse forced me to cut 2 more points of course some <UNK> will take that as a recommendation after all one thing even more disturbing than this film is that some people actually gave it positive reviews
<START> if ever there was a film that can be considered a missed opportunity then that film is <UNK> what could possibly be wrong in <UNK> a sci fi film around a sexy <UNK> female <UNK> surely such a film could never be a complete waste of time well sadly this movie is pretty close to useless there are a number of faults with this production it has to be said however there are two basic problems that entirely destroy the whole enterprise firstly this is a comedy with no funny bits at all or at the very least a film where the potentially amusing aspects are presented in an incredibly <UNK> way secondly the title character is woefully underused this may be because dorothy <UNK> was not really an actress but if so it was a terrible decision as she is still easily the best thing about the film i don't think she really needed to be a great <UNK> to pull off the role of a sexy <UNK> to be perfectly honest anyway what we are left with is a whole lot of mind numbing comedy relief which often is made up of hopeless spoof type gags of the big sci fi hits of the time such as alien star wars and 2001 it's badly written and not funny at all and it doesn't even really have a plot to <UNK> things along the story basically is about a police space <UNK> that is sent to get a rock that's it steven spielberg once said that a high concept movie was one whose plot line could be described in one sentence what he didn't define was what you call a movie that can be described in less than a sentence pointless maybe br br this seemed like a sure fire winner to me but it failed miserably it seems to have been an attempt to spoof star wars and combine it with adult comedy situations all it does actually achieve is to leave you cold and a little irritated that it wasn't close to what it should've been a <UNK> for the 80's this ain't br br shortly after this film was finished dorothy <UNK> was murdered in an <UNK> violent and horrific way and for that reason <UNK> has derived a considerable amount of it's cult interest i just think it's a great shame that dorothy didn't have a better film left to her
<START> this movie was great and i was waiting for it for a long time when it finally came out i was really happy and looked forward to a 10 out of 10 it was great and lived up to my potential the performances were great on the part of the adults and most of the kids the only bad performance was by milo himself there was one problem that i encountered with this and others like it movie all of the characters i wanted to live were getting killed overall i give this movie an excellent 9 out of 10 maybe we should <UNK> better people to kill next time though ok
<START> this movie follows in the tracks of the <UNK> for an all star british cast in a downright awful movie poor cgi effects poor editing poor direction a cast that i hope were well paid as this will be a nail in many a careers coffin br br <UNK> should've <UNK> his neil wig once more gone out with a laugh at least br br it was like a particularly long drawn out episode of <UNK> but without the camp fake canadian doctor <UNK> it had the same overly dramatic music though <UNK> repeated in a vain attempt to drum up some tension br br oh the humanity
<START> i watched this movie last night i'm a huge fan of the book and i was pretty happy with the version in which <UNK> <UNK> and susan sarandon starred but this one it's just awful oh my god i don't understand how they <UNK> to ripped apart this classic story and made the characters totally different starting with the switching of beth being the younger sister and making amy the 3rd one and jo interpretation terrible jo was a feminist intelligent and kinda angry young lady and the actress portraying jo in this movie acts like a foolish and very annoying little girl and what's with the laurie going to war i'm ok with the fact that when a book is made into a movie there has to be some changes made but not re write the whole story very very bad done
<START> one of the latest disaster movies from york entertainment el excels in making its viewer want to die after having wasted two hours watching it this movie appears to have been filmed with a spare camcorder normally used for birthday parties the only reason i could tell that it wasn't was because of certain scenes where the <UNK> shadow is in the frame br br just about every aspect of cinema is plagued by this movie and i'm sure that it has set the film industry back another ten years the actors are borderline retarded often <UNK> while they wait for the off screen cue card to change the actor that plays not only <UNK> and <UNK> word in his dialogue but stumbles through the swiss cheese plot line with a <UNK> and <UNK> look on his face other actors break the forth wall and overall show the acting skill of a twelve year old kid doing a science project in his backyard br br my friends and i <UNK> search out the worst possible movies and this one gave us more than we <UNK> for the humorous parts are unfunny and the rest is <UNK> with horrible clich√©s and plot holes as one friend so <UNK> put it this movie is the <UNK> <UNK> of the industry i would highly suggest this film for people like me that <UNK> search for these movies but for all others beware
<START> i just saw the dvd and loved it in particular i thought the director and jude and nicole did an amazing job with the kiss between and <UNK> just before left it was the most romantic kiss i've ever seen in a film i thought it was crucial for setting the tone for the rest of the movie it managed to make it believable that and <UNK> would walk wait respectively for each other for all that time without ever really having had a relationship i thought the film managed this crucial plot point much better than the book itself i'm sure many of you will be quick to name other film kisses which best this one but this one is it for me jude and nicole had showed incredible chemistry in the far too few scenes they had together
<START> this film is absolutely appalling and awful it's not low budget it's a no budget film that makes ed <UNK> movies look like art the acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything i have ever seen an ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants <UNK> has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a <UNK> <UNK> pit there is <UNK> as you would expect from an 80s italian video nasty no talent was used to make this film and the female love interest has a huge italian taste maybe even for 80s italian standards this film is pretty damn awful but i guess it came out at a time when there weren't so many films available on video or viewers weren't really <UNK> this piece of crap has no entertainment value whatsoever and it's not even funny just boring and extremely cheap it's actually and insult to the most stupid audience i just wonder how on earth an actor like woody <UNK> ended up <UNK> a turkey like this
<START> having broken into a secret <UNK> file for matching <UNK> federal agent frank poo andy garcia discovers the only person who can save his son's life is a psychopath played by michael keaton however when a serum transfer at the local hospital goes terribly wrong a certain mr poo has to do everything in his power to ensure the madman stays alive in order to make the inevitable transfer possible by the way his name really poo i just feel like calling it him despite the original concept at hand this is an implausible and <UNK> <UNK> action thriller i've never been a big fan of andy garcia and granted his <UNK> here that this movie winds up all the worse the action sequences are handled pretty <UNK> and the ending sucks pretty bad having done a great villain in pacific heights keaton's <UNK> bad guy here is a let down providing a madman too funny and charismatic to be brian cox is also wasted as <UNK> firm and frank superior
<START> finally watched this shocking movie last night and what a disturbing <UNK> it is and unbelievably bloody and some unforgettable scenes and a total assault on the senses looks like a movie from the minds of lynch specifically <UNK> <UNK> and even a little of <UNK> what this guy does to his pregnant sister is beyond belief but then again did it really happen or is it his <UNK> left and right sides doing battle that's the main theme of this piece of art to draw a fine line between fantasy and reality and what would happen if the right side of the brain that dreams and <UNK> <UNK> the reasoning and logical left side and the music in this movie is unbelievable a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect even though this movie is totally shocking and pretty disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes including hard core sex you will ever see in any movie i viewed it as a work of art and loved it and that music still <UNK> me i have to try and find the soundtrack if is available watching <UNK> cruelty is a real event and not something the viewer will easily forget and a note to <UNK> this is a must have br br warning be careful buying this movie because some <UNK> have <UNK> on the graphic sex scenes and extreme gore especially the copies from the japanese release
<START> ok i haven't read the and maybe the book was who knows but i loved the movie it was entertaining not a bit boring enjoyable and most of all heart wrenching the friendship between the two kids was so pure and innocent these kids acted so well especially the son of the servant oh my god that's like the form of god on the face of earth he steals our heart so easily spoilers the other friend the rich guy is a kid and his confusion and frustration can be understood but i did get angry when he abandoned and ignored his friend in the time when he needed <UNK> anyways he was just a kid and a bit stubborn to i wish the movie would also have shown the older version of the poor kid it pains to just think of the ending this movie is sad i felt terribly sad during the ending tears dropped down my eyes yes the background scores are fantastic the scenes are wow the <UNK> scenes are fascinating and well it gets a bit of an adventure in the middle wonderfully acted and superbly cast the kids acted so well great direction don't know why this movie failed to the critics but it sure did woo me 10 10 must
<START> this movie could have been oh so much better it is a beautiful story set in very trying times and yet it was so poorly executed the leading actors have in the past done excellent jobs and for the most part they do an adequate job in this film although at times their dialogue seems stilted and forced the directing could have been more <UNK> the bulk of the criticism should go to the writers who took a good story and made it tedious in short there are thousands of much better ways to spend 2 hours
<START> america's next top model is a good show it helps people with their careers but lately i have become bored with it br br cycle 1 yeah i'm happy <UNK> won i wanted her to win from the beginning br br cycle 2 its too bad i think <UNK> deserved it br br cycle 3 i did not like eva but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle br br cycle 4 should have won i don't know what they saw in but i definitely know what they saw in br br cycle 5 like cycle 3 this was not a great cycle either but out of all the girls nicole as a winner <UNK> br br cycle 6 i liked sara and <UNK> but <UNK> is okay too br br cycle 7 definitely deserved it br br cycle 8 no i didn't want to win i didn't like her i saw other girls in that cycle with definitely more potential than her although i did not see much of this cycle br br good show i've just seen it too many times to like it much anymore d
<START> when it opened in london during the christmas season of 1969 this musical version of james <UNK> famous story was by the critics the same reception <UNK> it when it opened in the us <UNK> mgm to <UNK> its <UNK> status and cut almost all of its songs what a mistake br br watched years later when the trendy world of the 60's and 70's has turned in upon itself this version of goodbye mr <UNK> is a total delight first of all as <UNK> peter o'toole gives one of his greatest performances to watch him turn from the hated cold <UNK> latin teacher at a boy's <UNK> school to a man who finally can see the colors in the world after falling for and marrying musical star catherine is to see a genius at work if you can watch lawrence of <UNK> the lion in winter my favorite year and <UNK> back to back over a number of days or weeks then you will see what a truly great actor o'toole is and how magnificent he is in <UNK> br br catherine as played by the glowing clark at the height of her popularity is ever man's dream beautiful loving understanding with a great voice to boot most of the songs are beautiful and fit the story perfectly while the direction by the late herbert ross brings the proceedings wonderfully to life br br okay this film may be a bit too romantic for some people but for those who are looking for a beautifully acted sung and directed love story look no further if you can get your hands of the laser disc wide screen version better yet i am <UNK> awaiting <UNK> debut on dvd
<START> new year's day the day after <UNK> a few too many <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> mixed with a bunch of <UNK> at midnight my wife and i discovered the local cable company is offering up the digital <UNK> channels for free for the month of january we had a choice do we make use of the <UNK> channels or do we start watching the eight seasons of x files on dvd that we received from our daughter for christmas br br we elected for the digital <UNK> since the dvds are going nowhere and we need something like ten twelve hour days to watch all the x files beginning to end the drive in channel was offering a horror classic three movie marathon asylum 1972 house of the damned 1996 and the pit and the <UNK> <UNK> asylum is well reviewed here and the pit and the <UNK> was on too late for us to watch which meant we could really only be properly critical for house of the damned br br to be honest we tried to be serious about the movie since its stars have reasonably good acting <UNK> greg <UNK> william <UNK> over written and alexandra paul the only <UNK> babe who could act although she has the body of a ten year old boy unfortunately we soon <UNK> to <UNK> under the influence of a little hair of the dog as we each <UNK> out the names of movies from which this dog borrowed its scenes <UNK> the shining hell house house on haunted hill ghost <UNK> br br the acting especially by real life daughter wasn't too bad considering the silly script they had to work with the cgi for 1996 was hilarious at its worst point in the final scene when it should have been the most horrific it was so bad my wife and i <UNK> in laughter br br overall acting 4 5 script 2 5 <UNK> 0 5
<START> this is one of the funniest movies ever made and for those of you who don't get it it's supposed to be funny so often comedies try to be so intentionally funny that it misses but here is finally a movie that succeeds in being hilarious in the most subtle of ways even spoofs lack the originality and natural feel of this film it is a comedic classic that will surely be appreciated in another time when studios are this sort of thing regularly kudos to the makers and to a hilariously subtle cast of actors including <UNK> <UNK> whose performances is top notch truly a real break out star performance by an true underrated stage actor it'll be great to see this guy get his due
<START> nobody 1999 is a fantastic piece of japanese noir it's about three who get in way over their heads when their innocent drunken p off three other guys one night in a bar when these three mysterious strangers who are up to much more <UNK> no goodness than even the film allows us to know beat the living <UNK> out of one of our heroes the trio decides to return the favour in kind only they accidentally kill one of the other guys the remaining two baddies then begin the <UNK> destruction of everything these poor <UNK> hold dear including their fast <UNK> sanity <UNK> dvd <UNK> features a critic quote calling the film a paranoid street crime <UNK> or some such and the term more than applies here brooding tense very violent and low key but still pretty slick shot largely at night with many deliberately vague moments and character motivations that keep the audience guessing right along with the <UNK> protagonists who to some degree deserve everything they get i give it a 10
<START> we brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play the film is barely watchable and the acting is dire the worst child actor ever used and <UNK> giving a <UNK> performance the plot is <UNK> and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable br br just terrible
<START> this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen br br what is the purpose of this movie a bunch of americans enters nazi occupied france and starts <UNK> germans you see them their enemies and beating them to death with baseball bats while making jokes of course br br some will say that this movie is a parody of a certain genre for a parody it is neither witty nor funny the <UNK> is zero it is exceptionally brutal and disgusting underneath lies a subtle political message because it is again the good guys killing bad nazis the whole plot is <UNK> if you turn it around could you imagine a storyline where nazis while making jokes kill everybody in the <UNK> ghetto with <UNK> probably not but this movie is exactly about that with the exception that is <UNK> the weird moral expectations of a certain audience <UNK> people is so cool when done by the right people br br this movie only works because of the hidden nazi ideology underneath it does not regard the enemy as people and if the latter is supposed to be an element of the fun i am happy to say that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me br br another mystery is how such violence can <UNK> the american crowd while a bit of nudity will freak them out but if a naked body is pornography this movie with all its brutality is pure pornography at its very worst br br <UNK> <UNK> is a pointless boring and tasteless waste of time and money
<START> if this film becomes a holiday tradition i am going to have to hide for christmas for the rest of my life how do you even think of comparing this with 'a wonderful <UNK> it was absolutely awful the boy singing made my <UNK> <UNK> and what on earth was the deal with his hair emmy worthy performance please granted <UNK> did ok but an emmy i think this film is a waste of money the fact that they stuck so close to the original story pretending to give it a modern and retro touch made it even worse it lacked enthusiasm and <UNK> on all accounts lighting wardrobe make up it seemed everybody wanted to go home just a big no from me
<START> this film is about a bunch of <UNK> who are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail miserably the <UNK> pull together to successfully complete their mission br br hilarity ensues br br like the police academy films the humor comes from the <UNK> characters on the boat i thought it was an engaging film and i will stop to watch it anytime it is on tv no it won't cause you to <UNK> your relative role in the <UNK> or inspire you to do great things for the service of mankind but it is fun enough entertainment for 90 some odd minutes plus lauren holly looks hot in a naval uniform
<START> the first film was quite hip and had amusing moments this film doesn't exactly have the same standard <UNK> <UNK> ice cube is still trying to keep his <UNK> going but this isn't just against <UNK> gina queen <UNK> with a beauty shop next door but soon enough a big <UNK> chain called <UNK> opening across the street <UNK> along with co workers and friends eddie cedric the entertainer jimmy sean patrick thomas <UNK> eve and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they are doing everything they can to keep regular customers coming and ultimately their business running against the competition also starring michael as ricky <UNK> leonard earl <UNK> as harry as quentin <UNK> robert wisdom as brown lewis as jennifer <UNK> thompson as and bad <UNK> as loretta i didn't like this film as much as the first because of the unnecessary flashbacks about eddie and it isn't as witty i just got bored of it okay
<START> the are coming is a rather disappointing british comedy from 1934 i purchased this because i like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama it certainly isn't br br it is about a couple who head for egypt to capture some desert drug <UNK> br br this would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy which lets it down a lot it is quite silly in parts <UNK> this there are some good action and location scenes br br the cast is lead by jack with anna lee as the love interest br br one viewing is enough for this movie overall a disappointment br br rating 2 stars out of 5
<START> this review does not necessarily expose the plot of the movie however it may change one's expectations of the movie and thus make for a less enjoyable experience br br ever rented a scary movie expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot this movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer it was cut poorly and jumped around too much making references to the past seem more like excuses as to why the plot was heading in its particular direction the writers must not have thought about how the potentially excellent plot should have been carried out because the poor construction of time throughout the plot is <UNK> to the viewer and makes the movie increasingly <UNK> to watch br br almost worse than the writers having abused what could have been an excellent and classic thriller was the fact that it gradually relied on cheap tactics for a scare the acting didn't make it scary and the situations hardly made it scary therefore it needed a few dark scenes with things jumping out at you to make it worthwhile even those were predictable br br not even the gore could've saved the plot and it rivals the gore of the successful thriller <UNK> br br speaking of <UNK> i feel like saw tried to follow <UNK> incredibly fascinating psychological theme but failed miserably in doing so i was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer the beginning scenes <UNK> the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller believe me it is far from that br br oh did i mention poor acting at first cary <UNK> seems makes a convincing performance however this completely <UNK> at the most crucial parts of the plot i was left in tears of laughter at this performance which is worthy of a <UNK> the performance of leigh is also terrible and too played out although not as bad as the performance by <UNK> and the big red flag with this is that is also a writer for the movie br br the end of saw could never make up for having lost the entire middle of it and that is what makes it a huge failure it was an opportunity wasted and i have no clue as to why monica potter and danny glover chose to take roles in this movie br br i am mad at myself for wasting money on just renting it it was definitely not worth the 4 and in the future i will definitely avoid seeing anything having to do with <UNK> or james wan the big tragedy in this is not that it lacked basis to its plot it's that the great potential storyline was thrown away and poor acting added insult to injury i'll avoid the poor <UNK> involving the title and just conclude with this don't watch this movie
<START> jon stewart aka john constantly rips <UNK> and anything <UNK> this liberal comic is anything but as he <UNK> his cutting humor down the throats of <UNK> <UNK> i've viewed the show while stuck in a waiting room while my car was <UNK> and this guy borders on <UNK> he'll take al side over bush any day he's shameless and everything he says is <UNK> by a phony <UNK> i do remember four years ago when he interviewed john <UNK> the two made faces at each other that seemed to <UNK> a <UNK> session it was like get a room you guys i just don't like <UNK> little <UNK> who <UNK> their propaganda call me shallow the daily show has had a long run and there are many <UNK> <UNK> who have a <UNK> hatred for <UNK> and <UNK> i'm not surprised at its success but do that many people actually watch comedy central that guy makes me <UNK>
<START> have just seen this film for the first time after <UNK> it on dvd br br it comes across as a cheap attempt to cash in on the two conan movies br br unfortunately this film didn't appear to have the same budget as the conan films and hence some of the sets and effects aren't as flash and some scenes seem <UNK> br br <UNK> is ok to look at but unfortunately she couldn't act if a gun was put to her head br br <UNK> supporting role looked like it was done as a favor to director <UNK> who also directed conan the <UNK> maybe arnie wasn't confident that he would go on to <UNK> films like predator total recall <UNK> etc br br some of the female <UNK> of the <UNK> early in the film looked like they were struggling to lift their swords and the looks on their faces suggested they were having great fun making this film i couldn't be so <UNK> if i was fighting for my life br br all this aside this film required very little concentration to watch and was mildly entertaining i've seen a lot worse two stars
<START> my first hugely disappointing bbc jane austen flick the tone is off the costumes are off the hair is off the music is from outer space and robert hardy bless him looks like he's really annoyed to be in such a stinker even some of the casting is off no i take that back a good director can make a <UNK> purse out of a <UNK> ear so to speak the performances in this thing are so over the top and melodramatic that it's almost a farce of a jane austen story which is ironic since <UNK> <UNK> is a sort of homage send up of the early gothic novel i wanted to slap the female lead after awhile who made the decision that she should be such a i had to watch pride prejudice <UNK> immediately to get the bad taste out of my mouth <UNK>
<START> oh my god i can truly say that <UNK> <UNK> is one of the world's most intriguing and important people especially of my culture she is incredibly inspiring and her story is the story of a great woman when i first picked this movie up i thought to myself the cast was wonderfully put together now lets see them in action <UNK> <UNK> is already my favorite and now one of my favorite actresses and <UNK> i believe she is the greatest of all time this movie had me on the edge of my seat and reaching for <UNK> while at the same time reminding me that no matter where you come from if you decide that you are going to be great then you will be great and <UNK> <UNK> played a wonderful supporting role 100 awesome and now even i know why the <UNK> bird sings
<START> my sister dad and i are really into d d and one night we were <UNK> netflix looking for a movie to watch when this one came up we thought we would try it out and i ended up almost dying from laughter the writing and acting in this movie is so amazing witty characters great interaction and hilarious moments kept us in <UNK> the entire time i love this movie it might not make that much sense for those who don't know about <UNK> dragons but nevertheless it is a good movie this only goes to show that movies don't need an <UNK> budget and big name actors actresses to be a success check it out if you want a good clean comedy
<START> two stars br br amanda plummer looking like a young version of her father christopher plummer in drag stars in this film along with robert <UNK> who really should have put a little shoe black on top of that bald spot br br i've never seen amanda plummer in a good film she always plays these slightly wacky characters in films that don't quite add up and she does so yet again in this one br br firstly we have two young women sisters who don't resemble in the slightest who allow themselves to be picked up <UNK> by questionable men along the br br <UNK> character sandra does at least have a good reason for allowing dr jake robert <UNK> to pick her up in the first place she has been run off the road seemingly by a maniac and her car is pretty much destroyed br br warning spoilers ahead br br however as we go along we realize dr jake is not playing with a full deck any more than amanda is he makes every decision based on the flip of a <UNK> br br when dr jake and amanda arrive at a motel who do we see but the <UNK> car and what does amanda do but get inside his station <UNK> and start <UNK> around what her motive was for doing this is never clear considering the man is apparently dangerous and might try to kill her one would think the last thing she would do is place herself in such a <UNK> situation br br not only does she <UNK> around but she finds some money and takes it br br shortly after this we have several other things that don't add up br br dr jake with amanda as his passenger runs out of gas and the two of them abandon his car and begin walking one would think crossing a desert he would have checked his gas <UNK> this seems a very unlikely thing for him to allow to happen then later he is seen driving the same car when or how did he get the car back br br dr jake tells amanda he knows she has taken the money now how would he know that he didn't see her do it as far as i know and she didn't tell him she did it br br then later we have a character named <UNK> david <UNK> the man who was driving the station <UNK> give the two of them a lift and i'll be <UNK> if he doesn't know amanda took the money as well how would he know that br br it loses credibility at an <UNK> rate the further we go br br when alice <UNK> sister <UNK> <UNK> gets in the <UNK> of the killer and decides her fate on the toss of a <UNK> one would think she would be very very careful that the <UNK> she <UNK> for a trick <UNK> would definitely be the trick <UNK> but apparently it isn't br br it's jarring things like this that destroy any credibility this movie may have had
<START> h o t s is one of those sexy 70's drive in movies that features many of <UNK> famous <UNK> from the 70's like sexy tall blonde susan pamela jean <UNK> lisa london <UNK> <UNK> and the late sexy angela <UNK> and would you believe a post <UNK> family danny <UNK> its the <UNK> girls <UNK> the good girls the <UNK> girls led by susan there's a couple of comedy relief gangsters a runaway bear a trained seal misplaced <UNK> etc etc think animal house meets <UNK> h o t s is an enjoyable little comedy with t a no complaints here i actually think that susan was one of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the 70's she did do a few more movies including if you like fun drive in movies you will no doubt enjoy h o t s 7 out of 10
<START> ya know what family guy started out as something fresh funny and more original the random humor used to be funny i actually used to think it was the best animated sitcom next to the simpsons after watching the new episodes that aired for the past few weeks i grew fed up with the show relying too much on random humor to be funny south park was right about dead on when they brought up the <UNK> and the idea balls br br and watching the show itself i don't understand why my parents like it so much there's nothing great about it the humor is funny and would've been funnier if the show didn't rely on <UNK>
<START> this movie just might make you the film was well worth the dark trip to town betty <UNK> <UNK> is the lone acceptable soap <UNK> out there her character is so charming and so convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness over her being such a goof i might even allow myself to get lost in adorable fantasy if it weren't for the fact that dr real name is george and speak of the devil <UNK> greg kinnear fills his role very well while charlie morgan freeman makes you wish for his wish to come true wesley chris rock makes you want to tie him to a chair and <UNK> <UNK> takes you back to those <UNK> grade school friendships the sheriff encourages you to feed him <UNK> and loose his name the remainder of the cast fits well never one to do the same movie twice nurse betty is the exception one of these long cold needing to smile about something winter days
<START> i have to say it is a sign that this film appeals to all ages if somebody by right should be <UNK> themselves away from anything remotely homosexual absolutely loves this thing br br i thought every last bit of this film was amazing and the casting was superb but i have to say anna <UNK> where have you been all my life br br having previously seen anna in several other things i was completely blown away by how magnificent she was br br diana may not be the most lovable of the characters but she could certainly take me home if she <UNK>
<START> dr teaches at the hospital and he is quite good at it the thing about him is that he is depressed dr and his wife separated his children are <UNK> he cannot perform in the bedroom and he feels as if he isn't doing a very good job at healing people he becomes <UNK> but meets barbara who changes his ideas for the better all around this story is a murder mystery and a group of angry <UNK> outside br br the movie is well done and the character of dr is well played out it's a little sad somewhat funny and somewhat of a drama it was good to see a couple stories wrapped around the hospital even if they were somewhat unrelated to what dr was doing great movie
<START> when i bought 4 dvds for <UNK> <UNK> in a local shop it should have been warning enough that this movie was not up to the usual standard of david <UNK> productions with a cast containing such names as james stewart and carole lombard i was looking forward to a real treat as many other <UNK> have said it is an odd mixture of plot and scenes that doesn't quite convince however i am so glad that i did view this film as i now have the memorable saying <UNK> let the <UNK> stop you from enjoying the <UNK> ' to live by this should sum up everyone's life pick out those <UNK> or spit them out or swallow them and then enjoy the <UNK> life itself
<START> take your video camera turn out all the lights in your house and film people running around with <UNK> for an hour and a half and you've got the basic idea of what this film looks like it is very irritating to watch this kind of movie to be fair there are scenes of daylight at the very beginning and very end of the movie i like scary movies and creature features but this one just didn't do a thing for me so sorry i really tried to like it there didn't seem to be much of a plot other than we've got to find a way out of here didn't learn too much about any of the characters so it didn't matter if we lost one or two along the way this isn't the worst movie in the world open water holds that title for now
<START> i was looking forward to seeing bruce willis in this especially since i remember being <UNK> by the original when i was young br br this movie is a perfect example of how movie companies can take a very good story and dumb it down until it's just another formula ridden hype of the <UNK> american law <UNK> system army vs the russians no sorry the cold war is over make that with the russians vs the terrorists similar to probably 50 other movies br br furthermore it treats its audience like a bunch of idiots the choice of weapon is well plain ridiculous are we seriously expected to believe that the world's most feared and experienced hit man terrorist would <UNK> that for an <UNK> br br the whole point of the original story was the tense <UNK> of <UNK> between the ordinary detective who is given the responsibility and the professional who <UNK> a ruthless but elegant plan to reach his target and then get away none of that survived all we have is the tired old american cia fbi army vs the evil terrorist plot we've all seen 1000 times before br br but of course the movie <UNK> realised that a new intellectual angle here would lose them <UNK> from the short attention span gang so the answer is bruce willis big explosions and a crippled plot they assume the american audience wont be able to relate to a threat to a foreign where is france on the map <UNK> so it has be an american br br another example of a movie by the <UNK>
<START> i love basketball and this seemed like an intriguing movie however in the first ten minutes of the movie i knew that it was going to be lousy it was poorly acted and much too slow on top of that it was very very racist sexist <UNK> and <UNK> sometimes putting in racial ethnic and other types of <UNK> has a point <UNK> the <UNK> that exists in this movie there was no point to the horrible <UNK> and no one learned from what was being said part of the problem is that it was an adaption of a play and a remake of a 1982 movie that dealt with a basketball team from the 1950's having this movie take place earlier in time would have made a little bit more sense it didn't translate well to modern times and the writing was horrible i don't know how the play was originally written but i can't believe that any movie as bad and as hateful as this one has made it to television and video in 1999 it was disgusting don't waste your precious time on this one
<START> rob lowe must have eaten up the entire budget but i can't fault him for running with the money even he would have to agree there was nothing good about this movie filming editing direction dialogue sets makeup writing casting especially the young girl and <UNK> child psychiatrist and the story all were just the worst i have never seen such a horrible movie pass this one up for any other rental selection or find yourself shouting out vile comments at the tv dead silent should be <UNK> for all time
<START> this is a film that really makes me cringe in 1951 mgm and looney <UNK> were making some of their very best cartoons with amazing animation exceptional backgrounds and great stories then in the late 40s a new style of animation began to appear such as the <UNK> rabbit series on tv animation with extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money unfortunately columbia <UNK> cynical <UNK> worked instead of the public hating the <UNK> as they should have many accepted them and the oscar people <UNK> actually gave this film the award for best animated short giving <UNK> for an inferior product unfortunately in the dollars and sense world of hollywood this soon began to creep into the products of legitimate studios resulting in rather crappy cartoons later it got even worse as in addition to lousy animation and backgrounds the stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults to watch the <UNK> and style of the classic cartoons were gone and for this tragedy i blame in part <UNK> one of the of cheap cartoons the story isn't that bad but the animation is a horror and listening to the kid saying <UNK> is a pain
<START> 1987 br br director <UNK> <UNK> deep red <UNK> screenplay <UNK> <UNK> and franco the church <UNK> demons photography <UNK> taylor a chorus line <UNK> music <UNK> <UNK> br br story betty <UNK> is the lady <UNK> of a very stylized staging of <UNK> <UNK> opera <UNK> time to shine comes when the <UNK> star breaks her leg before opening night when she is hit by a car running away in a <UNK> the famous curse of <UNK> takes a more sinister and <UNK> turn when right away the body count begins to rise it seems betty gets her first fan via a stalker who ties her up and tapes <UNK> to her eyes to force her to witness the grisly murders of the people around her story 3 of 5 br br acting acting in a lot of these italian films can sometimes be hard to judge english italian french german spanish can sometimes all be in the same flick as they usually speak their native languages making dubbing rule of thumb and hard to judge i usually cut them some slack in the area as a result acting 4 of 5 br br direction giallo <UNK> <UNK> enters again the genre helped <UNK> shows him at the top of his game with an exquisite blend of gore tension and beauty direction 4 of 5 br br visual this has to be one of <UNK> best looking films <UNK> filmed by taylor features some stunning and inventive camera work that keeps the film running fast and hard and keeps the eye candy coming the camera always seems to be in notion whether it is a wonderful shot of the camera going up a spiral <UNK> or a sequence towards the end of a <UNK> eye view of said bird <UNK> the crowd at the opera house visual 5 of 5 br br audio frequent <UNK> <UNK> through his various bands <UNK> and solo effort <UNK> the screen action with <UNK> as his score touches from the classical <UNK> to metal <UNK> with a little help from brian and roger and bill <UNK> and lends music muscle to the <UNK> bloody the sound design give you all that you need from <UNK> to <UNK> fire to screams and masterfully <UNK> on the anchor bay disc in glorious 6 1 for every <UNK> and <UNK> audio 5 of 5 br br technical the editing keeps the film flowing and moving wonderfully combined with the camera work the editing help keeps the surreal dreamy imagery flowing the exquisite opera house is one hell of a location and perfect for staging the horror version of <UNK> one can't end a review of an <UNK> film without having to comment on the kills <UNK> <UNK> characters with glee this time around with a brilliant stabbing sequence crow eye <UNK> and the film highlight of a gun blast through a <UNK> into the eye and out the back of the head shot that once again sends <UNK> ex wife daria to the movie <UNK> priceless technical 5 of 5 br br wrap up a nearly flawless giallo that suffers from a slightly unnecessary <UNK> in switzerland that delivers all the visual thrills that <UNK> fans <UNK> br br overall 4 of 5
<START> travis james franco is a young man riding a train for business reasons we're to assume who leaves his beloved phone behind it gets picked up by a prostitute <UNK> rachel <UNK> and when he goes to her city to pick it up a series of events occur that are sure to stay with him forever br br both characters have <UNK> they've put up to defend themselves from communication but despite their <UNK> it's obvious both are eager to bust them down in total there are about 30 or so spoken lines but from the way james franco and rachel <UNK> use their faces you might as well turn off the volume words are unnecessary a scene to look out for is <UNK> staring at herself in the mirror you can just feel her despair <UNK> the room br br but the movie isn't perfect it's mostly filmed using hand held cameras which gets a bit distracting mainly due to the acting of mr franco and <UNK> and the photography the <UNK> flaws don't stand out as much still sometimes it seems as if the story doesn't really know where it wants to go br br all in all this is the type of film that truly stays with you long after you watched it an hour after you've seen it you're still <UNK> <UNK> ing yourself on the behalf of certain characters it's not flawless but still leaves you wanting more wishing it were at least <UNK> as long
<START> once again the posters <UNK> to me br br the marketing of this flick was deeply at odds with the content when i read the synopsis for this movie i was expecting to see a of <UNK> every man jack of them <UNK> and <UNK> by alcohol <UNK> by heroin <UNK> and bent double with <UNK> masturbation into such a <UNK> of vice would come the clean <UNK> hero shining gabriel instead the movie was the complete opposite of what i was led to expect br br the first few minutes of the film showed us that is a simple little place full of poor people doing the best they can whether <UNK> a little to make ends meet drinking to forget the pain or watching <UNK> fighting <UNK> not <UNK> to while away the boredom in other words the <UNK> were desperately ordinary br br the only deliberate grotesque in the piece was gabriel the <UNK> <UNK> preacher played by <UNK> whose face is built in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of <UNK> fury if i were kind i would suggest that the <UNK> of the preacher were a witty comment designed to make us despise gabriel and his faith unfortunately brian kirk is so inept a film maker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie leaving the audience to <UNK> their way through <UNK> plus minutes of dark hackneyed tedium my only <UNK> from this waste of celluloid was a game of guess the accent broken up with rounds of spot the location are we surprised that ends up stealing his brother's child and <UNK> his father of course not he's a bible bashing preacher and therefore psychotic all the <UNK> stand around looking shocked at the end of the movie but i suspect that they've just realised what a turkey they've put their names to br br the northern ireland film and television <UNK> have a budget to spend but there are better projects than this feeble enterprise the only kind thing i can say in favour of this movie is that it has managed to replace superman returns as the worst film of 2006 one hell of an achievement br br <UNK>
<START> interesting topic pathetic delivery script and direction br br our hero miles <UNK> out and has his <UNK> world first life <UNK> surgery this is where the fun begins the underlying issue is that miles has no soul this is used to explain his quasi <UNK> behaviour of being <UNK> responsible for two deaths i believe this to be the total number of deaths in <UNK> minutes br br on the side miles prefers the odd glass of <UNK> blazing <UNK> and his young <UNK> female cousin the finale does indeed do justice to this film br br some thoughts 1 producer were <UNK> with to create this tripe j d was the script writer and a or sole producer looks like he did not learn a lesson on how not to bring an interesting idea to life when one views his other writing credits this will support the credibility of this script br br 2 now available on dvd this is truly scary should be forever bottom of the shelf in vhs format br br 3 a re <UNK> human without a soul will <UNK> to an evil <UNK> br br 4 the score offers minimal support not even an in form jerry <UNK> could save it br br 5 deserved the time <UNK> on tv and a touch more entertaining than the <UNK> test <UNK> it was competing against at the time of my viewing br br 6 thankfully did not <UNK> any sequels ala wes craven's nightmare franchise <UNK> too the return return of miles or something like that br br despite my rating of 1 i still recommend this movie as a great example of how to kill an acting or script writing career this should apply to directing however wes craven will <UNK> be <UNK> due to his sole good piece of a nightmare on elm street 1984
<START> one of the best films i've seen in a long time precise in its vision and beautiful and highly imaginative in its realization i can't say much without giving it away and i don't recommend you actually read that much about this movie before seeing just see it br br but ah one must come up with ten lines of text to have a review listed on imdb <UNK> what can i do tell you about the film nope can't do it i think i enjoyed this movie precisely because saw it with no <UNK> please you do the same br br i suppose this can be said the acting is excellent and understated and what i have come to love about foreign movies is that the movies are actually about the movies not the stars
<START> if you thought rosemary's baby was bad this one isn't much better easily one of the worst movies ever made like it's lame predecessor it goes nowhere fast br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> why oh why did i ever waste my time watching this film it was given to me on video by a friend and i thought i'll watch it it can't be that bad surely firstly the acting is simply appalling and we're supposed to believe this is real secondly this film is blatantly trying to copy the blair witch project yawn and does so very poorly so if you want the fright of your life i would suggest that a <UNK> halloween special would be far scarier but if you just wanted to a laugh then maybe the general <UNK> of this film would suffice but overall i would avoid this film at all costs or drink a large amount of alcohol before viewing the best bit its only about an hour and a half thank god
<START> alright lets break it down why is this one of the worst films ever because there are so many answers to that question i'm having a headache come on cracker world mr the part with the arab guy its just awful i didn't really care about the whole white racism crap but when they did that thing with the arab guy i wanted to get the names of all the writers its really not worth watching 3 seconds of this movie it isn't even funny bad which was my first interpretation i hope the person who directed this movie doesn't commit suicide but it seems likely i don't see any other <UNK> don't ever watch this movie if you watch it u cant say u died with no regrets
<START> the saint takes over stars george sanders as simon <UNK> aka the saint in this 1940 entry into the series it also stars wendy <UNK> jonathan hale and paul on board ship en route to the u s the saint meets and tries to make time with a woman wendy <UNK> who gives him the simon is coming to new york to help inspector <UNK> now thoroughly <UNK> due to a gangster frame up 50 000 was found in his home the gangster rocky <UNK> drew of course was found not guilty at trial and he and his fellow <UNK> pay the bill for the frame and attorney representation 90 000 in total today you need that to defend yourself against a parking ticket this was a murder rap br br rocky sends his bodyguard <UNK> gates to the <UNK> house to steal the 90 000 from the safe the attorney catches him red handed and sends him back to his boss with a message seconds later he's dead rocky meets a similar fate and on and on who's killing this group of gangsters the saint has to get one of them to talk so that <UNK> can be <UNK> can he get to anyone before they're murdered the woman he met on board ship <UNK> and figures <UNK> in the case br br few actors have a way with a line like george sanders and his dry wit good looks smooth voice and depth as an actor suit simon <UNK> perfectly paul provides some humor as the nervous milk drinking <UNK> gates and jonathan hale is great as the sometimes <UNK> but worried sick inspector <UNK> wendy <UNK> who appeared in many saint episodes is very good as the woman who captures simon's heart br br very enjoyable
<START> wave after wave of <UNK> <UNK> this film wants and at first promises to be quirky and original but is in fact obvious <UNK> and <UNK> in clich√© driven dialogue which builds to a of awfulness and cheese by the end throughout the film we meet supposedly off the wall characters who are actually very dull and just don't quite work and who through the horrific screenplay like men in <UNK> suits driving <UNK> through mansion houses and <UNK> <UNK> existential <UNK> accompanied by the of the film has occasional funny episodes often no funnier than a dog playing with its <UNK> which happened twice an <UNK> of the slapstick <UNK> humour of the film in general but by the end the film falls into an <UNK> of complete <UNK> and the director's <UNK> <UNK> which made me want to <UNK> my eyes out watch this film at your peril
<START> definitely the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life i can't find anything positive to say about this movie if this production is even worthy of that word br br this production is not even the standard of a low budget porn movie br br my question is simply why did someone look at the script and think hey i'm gonna make a movie out of this br br at the end of the movie i wasn't even hoping that nicole was going to make <UNK> she was really that annoying br br so for your own sake do not watch this movie unless you want to waste 85 minutes of your life
<START> i actually joined this site simply to write in about this movie i was sitting in my living room and this movie came on one of the local channels i made it about an hour through before i simply had enough curious to see what the general movie <UNK> public thought of this movie i looked it up on this site i was absolutely shocked to see that there were an overwhelming amount of people that thought it was great i needed to have my say and here it is this movie is absolute garbage it was a chore to sit through the jokes were uninspired <UNK> from other better shows and movies and <UNK> manic portrayal of this obnoxious character should only appeal to age ten and below that actually may be a stretch even for that age i'm all for slapstick <UNK> but there isn't even the <UNK> hint of wit or <UNK> i have an idea lets take bad uninspired obvious jokes and play them at twice the speed now that's funny ha ha br br movies that you should see that take silly humor and add comic timing and originality the marx <UNK> a night at the opera monty <UNK> the meaning of life south park bigger longer and uncut and the list goes on don't lose an hour and a half of your life on <UNK> crap br br by the way i can only assume that the reason that david bar <UNK> the other writer did very little in film after this movie is because he was instantly <UNK> i'm actually impressed that <UNK> was able to recover after this mess
<START> first of all i would like to say that i am a fan of all of the actors that appear in this film and at the time that i rented it i wanted to like it br br i think that the main reason that i was so disappointed was that the outside box promised me a suspense thriller in my eyes a suspense thriller for british movies is like something out of a ruth novel something that has a lot of dark twist and turns and leaves the viewer with an ending that is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon br br this movie started out with the promising note of being such a film we have our main character that suspects a man that he does not like of being involved in a hit and run that killed the husband of one of his servants his notions prove to be right but the idea that his wife might be involved does not occur to him until that she <UNK> to him that she was a part of the crime br br the elements of a good suspense thriller were in place at this point but from there i felt that the film took a different direction and became almost some sort of a mild soap opera about who wants to be with who and what the love of a real relationship is the film might have been enjoyable to me if the outside box had talked of a twisted <UNK> triangle and had not been labeled as suspense thriller this seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the beginning setting seemed to be a mild distraction to the true content of the film i felt like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did i felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big event that never <UNK> so i have to give it a lower rating than i would have liked to and say that it fell short of my expectations
<START> if you think piano teacher erika <UNK> isabelle <UNK> in michael <UNK> film la <UNK> is the ultimate degree in the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and darkness i've got news for you the piano teacher in <UNK> novel la <UNK> on which the film was based is twice as repulsive disgusting deranged and even more fascinating though there can't be words enough to translate the level of artistic <UNK> that isabelle <UNK> has reached here above all other mortal actresses in activity today and who else could have played this character with such emotional power complete with the best piano playing dubbing an actor could deliver br br in the novel as in the film there are two big <UNK> to the heroine <UNK> her own mother wonderful wreck voiced annie <UNK> in a part originally intended for <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> itself the mother <UNK> perception of her native <UNK> as a country that <UNK> and <UNK> encourages racist fascist or at least <UNK> behavior sexual and emotional <UNK> and let's say ideals which are impossible to keep today without the danger of a mental breakdown br br la <UNK> also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue how dangerous it is to reveal your <UNK> fantasies to the one you think you love we tend to think our own sexual fantasies must be as exciting to others as they are to ourselves which may turn out to be a huge embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake here <UNK> learns the lesson in the most painful and <UNK> of ways br br it must be mentioned that <UNK> is one of the best known and praised authors in <UNK> and europe well now she's got a <UNK> prize and that <UNK> <UNK> can be <UNK> in her novel as she herself was a <UNK> and had a reportedly difficult relationship with her mother the novel also includes long <UNK> about childhood and <UNK> so you kind of understand how she turned into who she is now <UNK> chose to hide this information in the film forcing us to wonder how she got to be that way don't we all know a erika <UNK> out there but he very much <UNK> the fabric of the book in his film unbearable honesty to the point where most <UNK> horrendous feelings painfully emerge envy cruelty violence jealousy hate misery <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc all of them <UNK> human br br i thought la <UNK> was a deeply moving film very disturbing and thought provoking with a handful of unforgettable scenes and that's just all i ask of movies it also made me buy and be thrilled by the book discover a fantastic author i hadn't read before and listen again and again to <UNK> so my thanks to <UNK> and isabelle on the other hand if you're looking for light entertainment please stay away my vote 9 out of 10
<START> there is a special heaven reserved for people who make the world laugh alongside chaplin stan and ollie the marx bros and fill in your own special favourites space must be made for everybody connected with airport 80 <UNK> the movie robert wagner in particular <UNK> all expectations giving the comedy performance of a lifetime i would never have thought he had it in him the only way he could have been funnier would have been to have worn a red nose and a revolving bow tie british <UNK> will <UNK> the fat one from cannon and ball pretending to be a russian <UNK> a nice trick if he could have pulled it off but <UNK> he couldn't i have a 14 year old <UNK> more athletic and almost as funny george kennedy bless him has a part that requires him talk and move at the same time and my goodness he <UNK> brow <UNK> with effort he <UNK> timeless dialogue each word lovingly polished into coward like brilliance only once in twenty years does hollywood turn out a film like airport 80 all the years of <UNK> and struggle the sweat the tears the lessons with lee <UNK> living out of <UNK> born in a <UNK> etc etc all come to <UNK> a work of art is created that will last as long as there are movies and machines to show them on i think i'm ready for my <UNK> now
<START> and the title says it all a cheesy sounding title that is a cheesy sounding joke of a film known as alien from l a why not just call it alien from south africa as this is the place where this movie was filmed my advice for watching movies that have been featured on mystery science theater 3000 do not watch the original version of the movie at all period always watch the movie with the theater shadow at the bottom of the screen with a man trapped in space with his two funny wise cracking robot friends sitting at the lower right hand corner of the screen it just seems better that way br br movie as it was originally seen awful movie as it was seen on mst3k genius
<START> the dvd release of this superior made for tv bbc drama is a more than welcome addition to my collection great acting gripping story and wonderful direction all add up to one of the best bbc dramas in years
<START> i must admit that this is one of the few lou <UNK> films that i actually saw in the theater most have now been seen on t v and i must admit that lou is really enjoyable and he gets the girl too this was my first time seeing dorothy perform and of course i fell in love with her like so many others that day i have seen most of the work she has done and enjoyed each one her performance in the great race is one of the reasons i bought the disc in the first place br br every comment on this movie tells that this is the one movie that lou <UNK> did with out bud <UNK> which is true but if lou had lived he would have made many more he really does a good job and doesn't have to rely on his old routines to get laughs i for one am sorry that the little man from <UNK> n j didn't get the chance to do that br br i hope this comes out on dvd some time so i can add it to my comedy sci fi collection
<START> i love this film maybe it is my generation but i can really connect with what he is talking about and means to do it kept me laughing for the duration duration of the film the next day and beyond i think this film is not one to watch if you mainly care about the plot and character development this film is pretty much only for the generation that will understand it there are lots of things you just know being brought up in that generation that you wouldn't if you were say 40 i think <UNK> <UNK> cohen was very and i do mean very good he is a genius and the reason h is such an idiot is because he can make people believe he is a complete idiot and make it funny at the same time br br very good film strongly recommend not so strongly if you are over 30
<START> i'm not a movie <UNK> i've liked lots of movies that critics hate and i've hated movies that critics love however i have to agree with critics here <UNK> is just <UNK> clearly intended to be a comedy it only has a few scattered laughs <UNK> has poor photography it has poor special effects it has some pretty poor acting and the production values well the sets might as well have been made of cardboard br br <UNK> tells the story of a spaceship whose crew is looking for a magical object called the blue star after a long voyage and some very unconvincing space battles the crew arrives at its destination a sort of wild west alien world there's a painfully unfunny <UNK> scene clearly designed to be a spoof of the famous star wars scene a chase involving space <UNK> and a final <UNK> br br the cast tries but can't breathe life into this turkey stephen and <UNK> <UNK> have done better work in other movies james david <UNK> is pretty good as a member of the crew the late dorothy <UNK> stars as the robot of title and while she looks great her role doesn't give her much of a chance to act br br you might catch this film to see dorothy <UNK> however if you're looking for a good movie you'll probably want to skip this one
<START> after his earlier movie <UNK> which definitely shows similarities to this movie director david <UNK> again <UNK> himself in the world of virtual reality in which truth and fiction mix it's virtual reality taken to a whole other level br br is an highly original movie that is well directed and acted out but above all very well written the movie features a fascination and well thought out concept which gets greatly executed by director david <UNK> br br is a movie that knows to constantly fool you just when you thought you figured things out another surprise <UNK> around the corner things are never like how you think they are especially when the line between truth and fiction gets explored you just never really know what is the reality and what is the game world right till the ending it makes the characters and events all very unpredictable and also provides the movie with a great ending that will leave you thinking even more br br the movie has a perfect kind of game play storytelling mostly with its character appearances and its puzzling events they have to complete a certain step or task first before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose in the game is br br the movie knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and <UNK> without ever going over the top with either one the storytelling keeps the movie as simple as possible though of course the movie isn't always that simple to follow because of its events dialogs and unusual <UNK> br br the movie is not only just weird though i was actually surprised to see that <UNK> has an higher rating on here thought it's a far more <UNK> and <UNK> movie the movie is also still made entertaining and has a good fast pace it doesn't ever allow the movie to get stuck in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings it also makes this movie perfectly watchable for people who normally don't watch this sort of movies br br the movie is good looking with subtle effective special effects a great visual look that also provides the movie with a certain required feeling br br the movie is well cast with jude law in a role you don't too often see him in that of a shy insecure person it once more shows how actually versatile law as an actor is and that he is way more than just another pretty face from hollywood jennifer jason leigh also was a great female lead she hasn't really played ever that many big parts in big productions but with this movie she shows why she nevertheless always have been regarded as a big movie star the movie also features some other well known actors in much smaller roles such as ian <UNK> and willem dafoe br br an highly original movie that is well worth watching especially if you have seen <UNK> previously br br 8 10
<START> i rented this movie knowing that it would be bad i have only seen one good disney sequel and that was toy story 2 but it went far lower than my expectations i am a die hard disney fan and i just don't believe in sequels with disney movies for somebody who didn't grow up with the classics either watching them when they came out or renting them since you were born it's a cute story i just feel that the plot was dragged out a little too much and was to predictable the one thing that annoyed me the most was the voices of the girl children of lady and tramp they were too high pitched although most reviews say that it isn't that bad i think that if you are a true disney fan you shouldn't waste your time with this one br br hopefully disney won't be making any more sequels to any of the other classics any time soon
<START> i looked forward to seeing this movie because the trailer made it look so cool but the fact is that this movie is boring and totally muddled there is no plot and half the movie is fast flashing shots from football games <UNK> in shots that gives you no <UNK> of the games i was constantly looking at the <UNK> to see when the movie was over br br there's only one good thing about this movie the sound the soundtrack is awesome don't expect anything from this movie
<START> i saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me and we both had the same feeling about it it wasn't terribly <UNK> and didn't even <UNK> the idea of what a training schedule would look like so that non could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one in fact there was almost zero technical information at all i didn't expect this to be a tech heavy <UNK> video but when that info was near zero then the film just wasn't balanced and wasn't particularly useful to non <UNK> their first run br br there were other problems some of the very first images were people <UNK> near death while trying to run a race yeah real inspiring the timing was also hard to follow because it was semi <UNK> but the filmmakers rarely gave you any good clues as to what point in time you were looking at and they <UNK> information you see that has an injury and you just assume it's from all her training but then several scenes later they finally clue you in that it's because she <UNK> over a <UNK> <UNK> in her yard br br some parts were very good though like the bit about a woman <UNK> race officials who wanted the run to be men only and the coverage of a chicago race where two of the <UNK> portrayed earlier were <UNK> for first place br br off the top of my head i'm thinking of other <UNK> documentaries like <UNK> me and grass where you always know where you are and you feel like they told you everything you wanted to know br br in short it wouldn't have been hard to make a better marathon film and as it stands i can't recommend this to non to <UNK> and <UNK> them to try one because i don't think it will have that effect
<START> this film immediately catches the eye with the atmospheric <UNK> views of a very pretty hong hong filmed in those rich colours of 1950 films which modern blockbusters never seem to capture probably a sign of those times because this is not a high powered seen it all before film full of havoc and violence the havoc and violence are there though in the backdrop with thousands of <UNK> trying to get out of china this is a very moving and compelling story full of hope and love in a tragic time in recent history the story of two people from different cultures falling in love and the build up to them trying to overcome this is the heart of this very fine and moving film
<START> i watched this movie on video the other night and found myself <UNK> off throughout this uninspired <UNK> first of all one of my biggest pet <UNK> is when movies like this are <UNK> as horror movies it is a thriller get it right it has no monsters or anything supernatural it is simply a movie about a twisted serial killer actually there is a very small body count so it is more of a serial <UNK> movie and it did a good job of torturing me the basic premise of a man <UNK> teenagers to his house of horrors through online chat rooms could have made for a great movie but we only see him lure one pair of teen girls through the internet at the very beginning of the film one of these girls turns out to be a local <UNK> daughter and he gets emotionally involved in the case the film quickly changes from a potentially intelligent <UNK> <UNK> thriller to a boring old cat and mouse game between the incredibly dull detective and the <UNK> captain <UNK> <UNK> played adequately by writer producer twisted sister <UNK> dee <UNK> the occasional attempts at meaningful poetic one liners about the positive effects of pain and the like from <UNK> are laughable if he is attempting to get people to <UNK> to these opinions through this film he fails miserably and unintentionally makes light of them the directing by john whose only previous directing effort was jurassic women which i will let the title speak for itself was uninspired and there was something wrong with the editing which resulted in the film being disjointed with a few scenes completely unrelated to the plot unless the screenplay is at fault which is quite possible this film a completely <UNK> attempt at a thriller trying to pass of as a horror movie that's only achievement was making me <UNK> at the sight of a few graphic <UNK> <UNK> if you see it at your video store don't waste your money but if you need something to laugh at one night and is on cable you might as well watch 3 out of 10
<START> this movie is good for entertainment purposes but it is not historically reliable if you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself oh i want to learn more about <UNK> life and his last do not rent they died with their boots <UNK> but if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film with a little bit of romance and just for a good story this is a fun movie to watch br br the story starts out with <UNK> errol flynn first day at west point everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything the movie follows his career from west point and his many battles including his battle in the civil war the movie ends with his last stand at little big horn in between the battle scenes he finds love and marriage with <UNK> olivia de <UNK> br br errol flynn portrays the arrogant but suave george armstrong <UNK> well olivia de <UNK> plays the cute sweet <UNK> very well especially in the <UNK> scene that <UNK> and <UNK> first meet their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance the acting in general was impressive especially the comedic role although stereotypical of played by <UNK> <UNK> her character will definitely make you laugh br br the heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes the beautiful costumes set the tone of the era the script at times was corny although the movie was still enjoyable to watch the director's portrayal of <UNK> was as a hero and history shows this is <UNK> some will watch this movie and see <UNK> as a hero others will watch this movie and learn hate him br br i give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film
<START> sadly every single person i ask about this series says they've never heard of it i remember it <UNK> from my early childhood i wasn't quite 10 when it came out br br my favorite story was a story short something about the way the stone soup story was woven into a greater story gets me every time and then the <UNK> explains why he has no story to tell and it becomes a story itself i've always been a fan of jim <UNK> and this is just one reason why br br i'm adding this dvd on the self with <UNK> the dark crystal the <UNK> story the princess bride the last <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> these are all dvds i share with my siblings who are 6 5 and 4 <UNK> old
<START> i'm rather surprised that anybody found this film touching or moving br br the basic premise of the film sounded to me like an excellent if provocative idea for a movie about a rare sort of relationship but one if i can judge by the real life examples i've known is extremely deep and loving br br however the film is cheaply scripted poorly scripted and although it has a number of very pretty looking shots i didn't find it to be anything special br br probably the biggest problem is that it is far too short and poorly composed to give its audience time enough to <UNK> emotionally in the characters we don't really care about any of them and so their <UNK> and obstacles don't really touch us br br i think a remake from the screenplay up with some character development by some really good writers could improve it greatly it is <UNK> to compare this film with <UNK> mountain which the screen writers took to far <UNK> levels than did the author of the screenplay screen writers who were clearly conscious of how to write a classical tragedy and carried out their task with care planning and superb <UNK> however people only seem to remake those films that don't need it you're not really missing anything if you skip this one i found it very disappointing indeed and it is only saved from getting a 1 star from me by virtue of the daring and <UNK> it took to make a film on this sensitive subject
<START> aka br br aspect ratio 3 x 1 <UNK> 1 within 2 <UNK> 1 frame <UNK> br br sound format <UNK> digital br br 1978 a working class teenager matthew <UNK> assumes a false identity and high society where he learns harsh lessons about the <UNK> between rich and poor br br <UNK> feature by director <UNK> roy jackson my life your fault an <UNK> of the pre <UNK> <UNK> as seen through the eyes of a low rent whose world view is transformed by his adventures amongst the upper classes unfortunately <UNK> screenplay says very little we didn't already know about the <UNK> of the <UNK> rich and the narrative is only briefly <UNK> by relationship with a handsome but self destructive rent boy peter <UNK> hills who turns out to be no less <UNK> than the very people he seeks to <UNK> also starring diana quick as an outrageous <UNK> who believes working class people are embarrassed to be alive bill <UNK> as the black sheep of a wealthy family lindsay <UNK> <UNK> blake different for girls and <UNK> hale in a typically flamboyant cameo flashing her boobs at all and <UNK> without a care in the world br br unfortunately much of the film's impact is <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> on using a <UNK> effect three separate 1 <UNK> 1 images are <UNK> within the 2 <UNK> 1 frame each one providing a different viewpoint of individual scenes which <UNK> the image and <UNK> viewers from events on screen a long pointless film too personal for wide appeal and <UNK> throughout by a cinematic process which fails to <UNK> the story at hand a single image version is also available framed <UNK> at 1 85 1 with the on screen title aka lies are like wishes
<START> hell to pay was a disappointment it did not have anywhere near the substance of a b western movie and should in no way be compared to a fantastic movie like <UNK> the dialog was dull the plot was <UNK> the soundtrack was <UNK> unnecessary and the acting was awful even the professionals could've taken some lessons from the sunset carson school of acting the only positive thing about this movie is that it <UNK> some of the top cowboy <UNK> in the nation but you can see them in a better light in any <UNK> video the <UNK> of this feature makes it very <UNK> and the preview is decent but it's all over after that
<START> my bad film guru and the president of the exposed film society <UNK> this one on us last week there was no denying the demented <UNK> in his eye as he pulled it out of its brown paper bag and announced what he had in store for us the most dangerous game filmed on a budget of about 2 95 br br of course 2 95 went a lot further back in <UNK> but still br br anyway there is certainly a lot to dislike about this film it <UNK> with serious technical <UNK> my favorite was the that fired twice in two minutes without benefit of a <UNK> the hero is a <UNK> who stands by while his wounded friend fights the henchman and gets killed br br more ok the plot is a <UNK> with no continuity to speak of the movie wastes five minutes with a <UNK> guest <UNK> who serves as the physical <UNK> of the <UNK> madness and paranoia but never shows him again the hero is <UNK> unconscious by the henchman but makes no mention of it when he wakes up and first meets his host the mute servant girl is captured put on the rack and then the movie and the hero who put her in this <UNK> just sort of forgets about her br br more well the sets are cheap and the special effects are cheaper the makeup is an exception to this much of the plot is carried by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> voice over which carries less dramatic impact than the menu <UNK> at <UNK> most of the dialog is simply ridiculous and stilted as if it was translated from japanese i demand that our conversation be pleasant and the color values tended to shift violently from shot to shot as if cheap film stock and <UNK> lighting equipment were the order of the day note this last may have been the fault of a bad print rather than the camera crew br br but there were a couple of nice moments here and there the makeup effects were <UNK> good in contrast to the rest of the film the actors were looked interesting especially the mute servant girl and the <UNK> and in spite of everything there was a definite creepy atmosphere to be found very nasty and disturbing br br so what was the deal with this movie i thought about it a bit and realized that director writer pat basically tried to put a story from of the old <UNK> horror comics on film that would account for the stilted dialog the <UNK> character development in a comic character even more than in film the <UNK> interior logic of the story <UNK> horror stories went out of their way to include a nasty shock ending and weren't big on psychological realism the over <UNK> on the narrative voice which belongs in <UNK> over the <UNK> and the interesting makeup effects that <UNK> the grisly pictures that the old <UNK> artists did so well br br in fact i'd be willing to bet that when saw his leading man during casting he instantly saw that the fellow was as close to being the equivalent of the <UNK> <UNK> figures and <UNK> in faces that artists like johnny craig and jack davis drew as an actual human could be and still exist in the real world he used costumes and lighting to emphasize the <UNK> aspect of the visuals and turned everyone into living <UNK> comics characters see the leading <UNK> blank beauty the <UNK> strong <UNK> features oddly <UNK> skin and sharp <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> on the tall <UNK> black henchman etc br br this would explain the movie's <UNK> knew how to <UNK> things but he didn't know how to deal with three <UNK> and moving bodies knew how to tell a creepy story within the confines of a comics page but the nuances of film and live actors escaped him he wouldn't be the first person with this problem of course look at what joel <UNK> did to batman but he didn't have a big budget to hide behind br br in any case i'm imagine that walked away from this train wreck and probably spent less time thinking about <UNK> of <UNK> than the folks who post on this film's message boards he did within certainly vague boundaries what he set out to do and you have to respect him for it even if you don't care for <UNK>
<START> son of the mask is a terrible movie i don't like the baby and i don't like the dog jamie kennedy and his wife are a cute couple but that can't redeem sitting through this garbage even at only <UNK> minutes or so it says the movie could not end soon enough for me the only real laughs come at the beginning with a brief appearance by ben <UNK> that's it the rest is just a rehash of the first movie actually that is just an insult to <UNK> why was this sequel made this movie cost millions of dollars to make why would i sit through a movie with a baby and a dog intentionally trying to drive the dad crazy jamie kennedy is talented but he has nothing to do in this movie i am not bothering to be nice to this movie 1 10
<START> a sick man <UNK> dee <UNK> <UNK> the teen chat lines as captain <UNK> he poses as a teenage boy and invites other teens over his house to party he instead knocks them out <UNK> them <UNK> their mouth closed and <UNK> them mostly with <UNK> he captures the daughter of cop mike gage kevin gage he finds him <UNK> him and he's <UNK> four years later he's released totally <UNK> but a lynch <UNK> led <UNK> by robert englund attack him and hang him he doesn't die but he <UNK> and captain <UNK> is back br br a very sick disturbing twisted horror film captain <UNK> enjoys pain and torture and is trying to show the kids he kidnaps how to enjoy it also the torture scenes aren't that explicit you hear more than you see but what you do see is very very sick there's no humor and the muted screams of his victims sound way too real i was cringing away from the tv during most of the scenes br br the acting <UNK> kevin gage isn't that good as the cop he's not terrible but he could have been better dee <UNK> is very scary as captain <UNK> his attack scenes are not pleasant br br all in all not your typical horror film i'll probably never see it again this film really gets under your skin but i recommend it to all horror fans at least those with strong <UNK> i give it a 7
<START> turning somewhat dark and utterly brilliant novel into light comedic romp could easily have been a recipe for disaster but it wasn't the story moves at a rapid pace and the black and white imagery is gorgeous as are harvey and harris as they ham their way through a wacky <UNK> berlin fun
<START> i thought this was a great action flick a very good role for <UNK> davis she is a very versatile actress one of my next to angelina jolie i actually watched the long kiss <UNK> right after seeing the new tomb <UNK> movie it got me thinking charlie or lara which one would win in a fight either way both women are very strong intelligent characters that are fun to watch especially when they're kicking butt i just hope to see <UNK> in another film soon seems like she's been out of the spotlight a bit too long it would be especially nice to see her in another film with samuel l jackson now they make a great duo watch this film if you haven't you won't be disappointed
<START> simply the best and most realistic movie about world war ii i've ever seen not only because the german soldiers talk german and russian soldiers talk russian no english in a german or russian <UNK> also because of the realistic <UNK> in which the movie was shot the acting is outstanding no hollywood sentiment at all even no love story <UNK> was supposed to be one of the most horrific battles during the war and in such context there's no place for sentiment or romantic scenes what you get is a movie which will make you thrill to the bone and which have one of the best unhappy endings a movie could have
<START> start with the premise that you will do anything to replace your lost love with a look alike throw in your scientific knowledge of a disease isn't this the stuff that leo g <UNK> <UNK> from the spider <UNK> in <UNK> throw in the fact that the main character instead of finding some way to attract the young woman <UNK> in heavy handed stalking until he totally draws attention to himself and has to <UNK> this insane plot if he can make the girl's father sick then help him recover she will marry him the problem is that most of the events are random and unpredictable anyone with half a brain would have seen through things there's a third party a woman that the doctor played by j <UNK> <UNK> has treated with great <UNK> you know she is going to be a factor there's also a gorilla kept in a cage who is used occasionally for heaven <UNK> what oh well there is so little sense to this who thing that it plays itself out and people get their just <UNK>
<START> this movie is the worst ever sorry but this was a total waste of good hours quasi psychology and b actors makes a <UNK> horror movie you can say that if you are into bad movies you will adore this one and the hot chick wasn't all that hot there is absolutely no climax to the movie and the worst part is the ending song some <UNK> thing with these words its in awful condition the world is a mess when heads fall of bodies and girls wont stay dressed the cops they are clueless eating <UNK> in their car next morning <UNK> body topless bar jesus sorry guys but <UNK> gone bad with this one
<START> from the opening shot of the meteor falling towards earth you know you're in for something special br br this is an ultra low budget shot on video movie about a group of teens stranded on a <UNK> island with some monsters the story is <UNK> and nothing you haven't seen a thousand times before the acting isn't great but isn't completely horrible however the special effects of which there are a good deal are laughable at best in fact if you can read this sentence chances are better than 50 that you could do a more credible job creating the video explosion and <UNK> effects in this movie than the filmmakers br br the movie's saving grace if you're in the mood for a grade z turkey of a film is that there's always something happening and it never gets boring and if you like making fun of bad movies with your friends you might just find this worth a dollar rental br br and i must say i appreciated the opening joke that is the dumbest name for an island i've ever heard probably the best moment in the movie
<START> along with cops the goat is one of keaton's two funniest shorts which makes it one of the best shorts ever made this has an decent plot for a short and it forms a perfect line on which to hang some great gags keaton is mistaken for an escaped convict how the mistake happens is a classic and then must <UNK> the authorities best gags the bread line and t he elevator
<START> such an awesome movie i was <UNK> the entire time and so emotionally overcome in the end the two young male actors in the movie were more than compelling in their performance as their friendship and support of one another was quite believable and i thought the comparison contrast between their respective home lives vs health situations were made so very real between them the success in bringing this movie to life was obviously a team effort so to actors producers writers directors and all of production i say well played having missed the credits at the beginning of the movie it was being shown on hbo i was so very surprised that i had to actually research albeit briefly the internet in order to find the title of this movie something so great should have been known by me a clear indication that this movie must be re released
<START> have you heard the theory of <UNK> <UNK> where a copy is <UNK> than the original <UNK> 2 is a perfect example of that they try to <UNK> everything from the first movie now in a few cases this work robert stack is actually a little better than ted knight when they play essentially the same character i actually like randy quaid who is no more or less offensive than bill murray in the original but jackie mason is no rodney <UNK> and worse of all demonstrated once and for all that dan <UNK> is one of the worst comedy actors of all time there is very little that i like him in and nailed the coffin shut on his comedic career as far as i'm concerned he seems to feel the same sticking more to like driving miss daisy and <UNK> factor other than that it's mostly been there done that for <UNK> 2 watch the original twice rather than each version once and you'll get more for your rental money
<START> but i still enjoyed watching her so i gave it a 3 instead of a 1 her expressions are priceless some of the other cast members e g michael are really <UNK> too the cat himself is somewhat amusing aside from that the movie is all cliche culminating in a much too long car chase it's also at this point that the movie becomes unnecessarily crude having been very family until then
<START> loved today's show it was a variety and not solely cooking which would have been great too very stimulating and captivating always keeping the viewer <UNK> around the corner to see what was coming up next she is as down to earth and as <UNK> as you get like one of us which made the show all the more enjoyable special guests who are friends as well made for a nice surprise too loved the theme and that the audience was invited to play along too i must admit i was shocked to see her come in under her time limits on a few things but she did it and by <UNK> i'll be writing those <UNK> down saving time in the kitchen means more time with family those who haven't tuned in yet find out what channel and the time i assure you that you won't be disappointed
<START> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> come through against all odds in this well done remake did you know there is no after well fact he meets <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> giants head in the clouds literally <UNK> and <UNK> horses who rule over <UNK> nearly <UNK> <UNK> is that where <UNK> came from we also meet the <UNK> dr bates the devoted mary <UNK> the sweet and devoted son thomas and the full cast of a truly horrific 19th century lunatic asylum suspension of disbelief comes easily and our 7 and 12 year old girls enjoyed it as much as my husband and i did sorry for the length imdb requires 10 lines
<START> the <UNK> highlight of this movie is peter <UNK> performance in turn wildly comical and terribly terribly tragic does anybody do it better than o'toole i don't think so what a great face that man has br br the story is an odd one and quite disturbing and emotionally intense in parts especially toward the end but it is also oddly touching and does succeed on many levels however i felt the film basically <UNK> around peter <UNK> <UNK> performance and i'm sure i wouldn't have enjoyed it even half as much if he hadn't been in it
<START> <UNK> east is widely known as john <UNK> last movie as he died on the set that's just what makes it so sad not simply that candy suffered a fatal heart attack but that it was on the set of such a crummy movie seriously i don't know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of crap but the flick has no redeeming qualities it's as if they took every <UNK> script for stupid westerns and just mixed them together and filmed it no wonder john candy didn't want to make the movie maybe his <UNK> participation was what did him in br br anyway the point is that candy did much better than this throughout his career to be certain he had already completed michael moore's canadian bacon in which the united states declares war on canada just stick with that one and you can say that candy ended his career <UNK> as for richard lewis who previous had co starred with candy in eugene absurd but hilarious once upon a crime he made up for this piece of crap by frequently guest appearing on <UNK> with keith in later years
<START> shah rukh khan plays an <UNK> lover who would go to any <UNK> to get his lady <UNK> <UNK> does a wonderful job of making the best of her character and sunny <UNK> plays the hero and action man this film is very good and i'd it to anyone
<START> during the civil war a wounded union soldier hides out in a isolated <UNK> <UNK> school where the head mistress and the teacher of the school decide to care for him and keep him about until trouble starts <UNK> between the lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls the soldier decides to take advantage of this situation but it all comes at a price in the end br br dirty harry 1971 which was made about the same time of the <UNK> might be my favourite collaboration between eastwood and <UNK> but after seeing this i tend to think this to be the finest work together a very <UNK> <UNK> and stylish vehicle for eastwood is always on the mark with richly controlled direction by don <UNK> and a <UNK> rousing music score by <UNK> <UNK> standing out strongly is its lurid and bleak nature that's <UNK> planted into the film's psychological makeup and manipulative <UNK> hold in sexual <UNK> it's played out and makes it more the brooding and blood <UNK> when those random shocks and <UNK> intentions take hold with gripping tension the way <UNK> illustrates john b <UNK> and <UNK> bold slow burn screenplay taken from the novel of thomas <UNK> is effectively done through stark emotions and the <UNK> tight lyrical context <UNK> strong direction captures the <UNK> southern victorian setting with such <UNK> <UNK> photography and he sets up some strangely <UNK> imagery with great clarity and restrained br br while the performances are truly commendable and high of quality clint eastwood as the smoothly suave sweet talking <UNK> union soldier is very <UNK> and delightfully assured a profoundly <UNK> <UNK> page steals the picture as the hardened head mistress and the elegant elizabeth <UNK> adds a delicate to her innocent character mae <UNK> is strongly <UNK> as the black maid and jo ann harris is the pick of the crop from the young <UNK> with her <UNK> sly persona br br honestly while eastwood's charismatic character plays the field for his own selfish needs there's still mixed intentions there that the one's being played where rivalry between the women creep in turn out to be no better than their guest at the end throughout there's a <UNK> dark sense of humour and ironic touch <UNK> into the material what's demonstrated here is simply more than your basic little minded shocker but one that's <UNK> layered with intrigue and a sense of realism that's hard to shake that also goes for its extremely eerie title and closing song br br a effectively chilling low key item that's hard not to be tempted by it's swinging <UNK>
<START> the new hope of romanian cinema if this is the new hope then i wouldn't really like to see the saving hero of such a prolific cinema romanian cinema that is now seriously where should i start 1 the crappy scenario are you kidding me this is not even believable not to mention it's high degree of stupidity 2 the direction what direction this movie should have had psychological tension at least that since they have decided to make it look as trashy as possible i admit is no polanski hitchcock <UNK> or lynch the list could go on but at least the minimum of effort would have been appreciated 3 the language i don't understand why almost every single romanian director believes that if you make the movie as miserable and obscene as possible then you have art i don't mind explicit language or bad image quality as long as the final result makes it worthwhile in this case it doesn't there is nothing to comment upon since everything this movie wants to say was already told thousand times the characters are far too <UNK> portrayed to become memorable the shocking events that occur are also poorly illustrated and become <UNK> this film relies only on the self induced emotions on the we must hype someone was found murdered so we must feel sad frightened or <UNK> someone went through this and that so we must feel in a certain way that's <UNK> because a movie is a piece of fiction nothing is for real here so the only true emotions are those that you discover when you wander deep into it's world the movie's that is br br
<START> not only is this a very interesting exploration of <UNK> and how we react to people in our lives it has some of the most well filmed views of a bleak northern winter landscape there's nothing pretty about this film but it stays with the viewer
<START> i really should have learned more about this movie before renting it it was one of those movies where you keep watching it <UNK> it's got to get better then when it ends you feel stupid for having wasted precious time in your life that you can never get back ice t did his bad guy thing and well that was the highlight of the evening the pictures of the <UNK> looks like it was done with a little toy inside of a box and the scenes were funny because you could see the strings attached to the space suits the script was lacking and the car chase scene with the guy bleeding and going unconscious was incredible because he drove better than i could have on one of my best days all in all i have seen worse but this sure isn't one i'd recommend or want to remember
<START> the bone <UNK> starts out extremely promising with the introduction of a new and original type of unseen evil as well as with the use of the <UNK> isolated filming location of the african desert whilst checking out in the desert three <UNK> are attacked and killed by a seemingly <UNK> creature that <UNK> their flesh and only leaves a pile of half eaten bones the expedition crew sent to rescue them discovers that the monster is a mutated <UNK> queen and pretty soon they find themselves trapped in the uncanny desert as well director jason <UNK> a respectable level of tension just until the nature of the monster is identified immediately after that the film rapidly turns into an ordinary creature feature with all the characters dropping out of the survival race one by one the second half of the bone <UNK> is boring with the inevitable love story clich√©s as well as a complete absence of gory murder set pieces the characters all are <UNK> stereotypes that act and say exactly what you predict several minutes in advance there's the rookie who has to prove himself the female with brain capacity apart from her hot looks the obnoxious experienced guy who <UNK> himself at the end through self sacrifice and ¬ñ last but not least ¬ñ who could forget the wise black guy who refers to the monster using all kind of voodoo names tries too hard to make his monster look like the outer space <UNK> of alien and predator the <UNK> creature has <UNK> vision and <UNK> when shot at yawn the movie actually just benefits from its unique setting and the handful of nasty images of bodies this could have been a modest gem but instead it's less than mediocre avoid
<START> i was just looking at the 100 bottom movies according to imdb users seeing if there was anything to review that i haven't yet and i found this little screen gem one of those occasions when you see a movie <UNK> as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that actually likes it darn well i guess i will get <UNK> and <UNK> upon here but for me this was a pretty good flick when i saw it it has been awhile however i remember it used to come on hbo late at night and i watched it two or three times and i haven't seen it really since and i would love to watch it again now knowing jolie was in it the story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the <UNK> of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them i think that is basically all there is to it throw in a few scenes with jack palance and we have our movie some good action here and there and some blood and violence as well there is also a love story at play as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight kind of fall in love with each other the dialog sometimes becomes rather bad at times and it is by far not a top notch film but for a b movie it is really good i don't know if it was a theatrical release though because it does not seem high quality enough for that but it does make for one of the better direct to videos if it was one of those
<START> when i saw this in the cinema i remember <UNK> at the bad acting about a minute or two into the first scene then immediately telling myself no this has to get better it didn't the performances are pretty uniformly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and no there is no sexual chemistry in this film whatsoever just the awkward <UNK> of a reasonably <UNK> <UNK> talentless actress who seems born to grace the cover of and not much else besides if the scriptwriter thought that making <UNK> a character was a stunningly original creative <UNK> he perhaps ought to get out more and if he'd given the matter a bit more thought would have realised that the story of carmen is just crying out for a thoughtful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> not this leave your brains at the affair of <UNK> passion and comic book dialogue this is contemporary spanish cinema at its worst br br
<START> christmas in august is a perfect movie a flawless movie about all the flaws of humanity on the outside it may look like a movie about death but is in fact a movie about life i simply cannot recommend this movie enough and be not afraid dear readers it is not a depressing film as stated it's a movie about the <UNK> of life <UNK> under the <UNK> of death you will laugh you will cry you will realize that life is fragile and short and you will leave the viewing with a better understanding of how precious life is br br 10 out of 10 br br go to www <UNK> com for a more detailed review of this movie and reviews of other foreign films
<START> i can not believe the positive reaction to this movie i had great expectations for it and was disappointed first of all they used every cheesy racism clich√© in the book it was so predictable for instance from the second the young latino guy showed up you just knew that he would be a really nice guy because he looked like a <UNK> matt <UNK> character has been played a million times a cop who had been hardened over the years and would see the light to some degree by the end of the movie the predictability hardly ended with those characters a phenomenal cast was wasted on a weak script the morals of the story were pc to the max there were a few clever twists but not nearly enough the <UNK> was embarrassing at times it wasn't all bad i just can't believe this movies high score so far it was somewhat entertaining just a little insulting to ones intelligence i admire what this movie was trying to achieve but it fell well short
<START> in the <UNK> that hollywood productions have become of late this movie in and of itself is truly <UNK> from heaven br br in what could best be described as a cute movie approximately <UNK> years of movie acting experience <UNK> give or take 100 years <UNK> lights up the screen to tell a tale of <UNK> <UNK> and redemption about a catholic family in buffalo ny br br truly well <UNK> to take its place in the feel good movie genre this quiet little independent film by the burton <UNK> five sisters productions company will leave a smile on your face and joy in your heart all while <UNK> your faith in mankind br br from the spectacular opening scene shots of buffalo ny to the final credits the film manages to tell a tale that could have been told of any family anywhere yet somehow this particular gathering of family and family by association in a small non <UNK> house in buffalo more than fits the bill if you've never been to buffalo you'll leave the theater with thoughts of <UNK> off for a visit shots of the city <UNK> and surroundings help to bring a quaint down to earth tone to the film which suits it just fine the quiet beauty of the queen city of the great <UNK> <UNK> rather than <UNK> from the tale that is being told if only more movies would take advantage of the natural beauty of this country's second cities instead of running off to a <UNK> somewhere the end results would be so much more believable br br great performances by shirley jones frank <UNK> wendy <UNK> jill and the rest of the ensemble cast prove again that true talent hollywood's flavor of the week any time br br go see this movie br br you've <UNK> in hollywood's desert for too long
<START> i love this movie even though i rated it a 4 that's because the acting the plot and the budget were all <UNK> to the b universe even before this movie was released but that's ok it is an entertaining film that has a lot to offer br br i remember what leonard <UNK> said about plan 9 from outer space a film so bad that it's great lacking the <UNK> alien plot the thing the couldn't die relies on the supernatural a buried head looking for it's body <UNK> etc to tell it's story the acting is stilted the camera work second class and the settings are limited but boy what a movie this film is available in the <UNK> market if you find a copy buy it
<START> i made sure to see this film because it is a 1950s sci fi film one of my favorite genres unfortunately while i was looking forward to either bug eyed aliens or power mad the aliens in this film were a major disappointment first you only see one very briefly at the beginning and he looked pretty ordinary and you also only got a tiny glimpse of a spaceship second the alien was neither the evil <UNK> or the <UNK> friend of mankind but a real odd ball and finally the plot itself seemed so dumb preachy and heavy handed that it <UNK> more <UNK> than thrills br br as the film begins five people from five different parts of the world germany britain russia china and the usa are kidnapped by an alien the alien gives each of them devices by which they can destroy all life on the planet if they so choose because the alien admits that his race of people would love to inhabit the earth but they themselves won't kill to get it then he returns them all while it's 100 obvious that no one would want to use these devices the alien then <UNK> on tv the identities of the five without telling that the weapons are that powerful so all the in the world want to find the five and force them to reveal how the weapons work much of the rest of the film consists of some of the five going into hiding and one being tortured to get him to reveal how the device works as the <UNK> want to use it this part of the film just seemed pretty silly sure the <UNK> was an evil and corrupt nation sorry but it's fact especially under <UNK> they never would have thought of using it like they did in the movie later one of the five the german scientist somehow figures out that the devices can also be used to kill only all the evil people who hate freedom so he uses it to wipe out all the evil <UNK> and presumably others who were anti freedom and the world then becomes a paradise preachy silly and full of plot holes this movie just isn't worth your time though it is an interesting <UNK> simply for the way it <UNK> communism in particular the tensions between <UNK> and the <UNK>
<START> before i continue forth with the new millennium i will go back in time once more because i had completely forgotten about these gems br br in 1987 disney while still a low company in the 80s was able to start a series of films on television called not quite human about a geeky teenager who like in inspector gadget looks like a human but is really a robot now this screams 80s along with other films like <UNK> and honey i <UNK> the kids because it combines everything of <UNK> with the <UNK> of tomorrow br br my parents remember seeing this on the tv back then back when i was just born or something however my very first encounter with this film was on the old disney channel one time i've seen this and the other parts on my <UNK> in may of <UNK> br br not quite human is a very good series of films to watch if you can ever find these movies again br br has this been shown recently if so give me an e mail or personal message br br 10 10
<START> h g wells is spinning no doubt about it br br really this would have been a decent sci fi adventure movie if it hadn't been based on a classic novel and directed by the author's <UNK> i kept hearing about how this would be the definitive version of the novel what resulted was a pathetic and <UNK> <UNK> br br the novel is a great sci fi story but what a lot of people miss when they read it probably because they read it when they're very young is that it's <UNK> with social commentary the and are a satire of the class <UNK> of victorian england and the overall message of the film is that everything <UNK> and <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> at victorian <UNK> and their belief that their civilization would last forever there's no love story no romance with a beautiful woman in the novel the are 3 foot tall <UNK> beings with a mental capacity not far above that of an animal the time <UNK> does <UNK> an woman but it's clear he thinks of her more like a pet and anyway she's killed before the novel ends br br this movie first tries to give us a totally stupid <UNK> as to why he wants to travel through time the <UNK> romance and the lessons he must learn are enough to make film fans vomit br br the journey into the future is <UNK> by a future disaster ok not bad but it would have had more punch if we had been allowed to see that mankind just generally <UNK> as in the book more a reflection of the times i guess as the george pal version had a nuclear war take place br br the general story ugh a total <UNK> of the novel the are too competent and <UNK> the are too intelligent the is an embarrassment and there's no setup he just shows up in time to be killed yawn br br samantha does ok guy <UNK> is one of my favorites but he often seems confused and in pain reportedly he broke a <UNK> while filming this he also looks <UNK> and overly thin as if he had been ill for a long time before making this br br a sad sorry film version of one of the world's classics h g wells deserves better much better br br
<START> i caught this movie on the horror channel and was quite impressed by the film's gothic atmosphere and tone as a big fan of all things vampire related i am always happy to see a new variation of the vampire <UNK> in this case a <UNK> like creature <UNK> in a <UNK> other dimension the director has done a brilliant job of conveying the dark mood of the subject using the <UNK> art scene as a backdrop to what is essentially a tale of love <UNK> time and space the pure love of friendship opposed to the lust for blood and life by the vampires in the story the characters in the story are transported to another dimension by the means of a mind <UNK> substance where a shape shifting vampire creature appears to grant them their hearts desires whilst <UNK> them of their life essence there are some <UNK> to drug addiction and loss of control and how this affects a group of friends in an artistic circle i enjoyed watching the 2 main male characters in the story chris <UNK> and alex who were very attractive <UNK> always a plus point in a vampire story for the female viewers the special effects make up and creature effects were well done and the set design of the <UNK> dimension was very effective all in all an enjoyable take on vampire <UNK> and recommended for anyone who likes their vampires with some intelligence and not just action the only thing missing to make it even better would have been a bit more <UNK> and nudity as it would have suited the plot and themes
<START> <UNK> love is one of the best movies i've seen in a while it's an emotional roller coaster one of my favorite scenes is the pub scene when <UNK> tells grace that he didn't want to go to the pub because the villagers don't like him you expect the worst when the old woman holds her glass up and says <UNK> the memory of victor fox and the whole pub follows suit i wanted to cry the funeral scene is hysterical julie does it in her typical julie andrews style <UNK> <UNK> is excellent as victor grace is one of kathy <UNK> best roles meredith <UNK> steals just about every scene that she is in rupert everett does some of his finest work in <UNK> as <UNK> the kiss between rupert and meredith took me to another bout of <UNK> in this day and age of gay rights being <UNK> i think this movie should be seen by all as a gay man in my late 40's i have seen people lose everything when a loved one dies so to all involved in the making of this film
<START> oh well i thought it should be a good action but it was not although jeff <UNK> stars there is nothing to watch only two fight for almost 1 5 hours <UNK> a lot of talking and everything is so artificial that you could not believe it the plot is clear from the beginning if you want good action don't rent this movie
<START> i'd buy that for a dollar br br i did buy this film for a dollar and i've seen much worse for much more br br this is a scottish sci fi film from mark and according to the making of hysterical by the way the production only cost <UNK> eight grand that wouldn't pay for half a minute in hollywood nevertheless this is top fun film making if you like things gritty then you're in for a treat these are some rough character with rough voices and harsh swearing i didn't mind but my girl friend did the actors do a fine job and it's interesting to see people that i've never heard of or seen before it meant i had no idea who was going to die first br br if you watch a movie for it's of the visual effects then watch a star wars the effects here are ok but kinda weak in space but the monsters are very well done if a bit like br br does an amazing job with not very much and i'd love to see his take on a real hollywood movie it least it wasn't predictable and i almost fell off my chair when one dude got his head blown off ok so it is a little derivative of other sci fi but for this budget it is an amazing attempt and anyone who thinks making a sci fi film for 8 <UNK> is easy or happens a lot clearly knows nothing about the film industry br br good marks for a good film extra marks for working so hard extra extra marks for a really interesting making of no standard bull here all the problems of production are gone into making it like lost in <UNK> only with a film at the end but why no commentary keep going <UNK>
<START> no no no that is my advice to you if you are wanting to see this film anthony <UNK> is the one and only norman bates as is janet leigh in her role as marion <UNK> this just seems like a <UNK> version of psycho with a few mildly different touches thrown in for a more modern appeal vaughn is dull as ill norman and viggo sam <UNK> seems too much the cowboy compared to the original please folks do yourself some justice don't bother with this one can only wonder what mr alfred hitchcock and mr anthony <UNK> would be thinking right now br br out of
<START> i saw this at the <UNK> film festival in the family section i'm not sure either of my kids really got the movie but i have to say that it was a wonderful short film br br and <UNK> is an interesting short film about the hopes and fears that we all felt growing up in the 1980's which in turn <UNK> to how my kids feel today then we had <UNK> today we got bush instead of nuclear war we have terrorism br br i really identified with the main character and i myself dated a in high school we all felt like <UNK> when we were 16 but it's great to see a film where they discover that everything matters br br again i probably wouldn't have put this in the family section there were a few too many curse words for younger children but it was a wonderful and enjoyable film to watch
<START> hal hartley entry into a european film series is one of his two or three best efforts to date and one of the few available on dvd at only <UNK> minutes running time my only <UNK> would be with hartley i always leave wanting more but never so much as this time martin <UNK> is astonishing as jesus <UNK> harvey is beautiful and interesting as but the high point for me was thomas jay ryan henry fool as satan hartley gives him excellent dialogue and a chance to use his <UNK> voice to full effect look for three scenes in which a <UNK> <UNK> him as if a poetry slam is about to be won by the devil i have read other comments on this film and had to add mine because there is not enough praise going around if you like henry fool martin <UNK> in anything opposite of sex and or very clever comedies based on biblical ideas get this as quickly as possible
<START> i rented a copy of this one from netflix big mistake the dvd version titled the one armed <UNK> was produced by <UNK> who thought that the fighting sequences would be appreciated better <UNK> all together in one big chapter than as part of a consistent <UNK> story some of the story was left in separate chapters which you can <UNK> from the main menu but the dvd is still a mess don't rent or buy it not that there was anything wonderful about the original story an <UNK> complicated piece of nonsense much as i liked seeing wang <UNK> in his prime again after all these years this one is an utter waste of time i've had dish that made a better film than this what the chopped up dvd version shows us is that no matter how silly a chinese script may be you have to see some sort of story to care about how the fighting sequences turn out br br but the one armed <UNK> does offer you do the chance to see both wang and shaw brothers <UNK> lo <UNK> beating up <UNK> pretty boy david <UNK> it's always a pleasure to see that happen lo plays a sort of second string villain here and serves as a prime example of why some people really need he film is also <UNK> by the participation of <UNK> actor chang <UNK> as the <UNK> br br another comment above mentions the obligatory fight in the <UNK> scene there are two in fact where wang and <UNK> are attacked by a pack of comical <UNK> using what look like <UNK> weapons making bruce lee noises while they fight none of this makes any sense but that's okay if you're not expecting any clarity or common sense it was fun to watch anyway br br another of this production is that there are no significant women characters there are a couple of female roles but they play no serious role in the action or the plot br br if you can find a copy of the original shaw brothers one armed <UNK> movie the one which explains why he has only the one arm and why he uses a broken sword go for it
<START> certainly this proves beyond a shadow of doubt that patricia arquette is what she is promoted to be an actress this is undoubtedly her finest moment of acting and she certainly deserves the credit for her work never in any of her other movies with the possible exception of holy <UNK> has she been totally believable and authentic br br plot a young woman finds herself in <UNK> asia and is suddenly thrown into the political havoc of the countryside she witnesses mass murder and <UNK> and escapes br br it is one movie that you must see or you have not seen all of hollywood's finest i rank it <UNK> in the top 100 films of all time br br thanks bob
<START> i would have to disagree strongly with the previous lame comment i watched this not expecting too much from it the fact is that the cast were superb especially the lead teen female the dark sides of them all came through all were messed up in an not obvious way there was an underlying current which ran through the movie of teenage angst and sexuality the serial killer role was played well also as you could feel he had gone through what they had as children what this movie is is a strong drama thriller yes i would agree they don't do the obvious but you could relate with the messed up teenage heads they did what they did and it is believable also a decent dark ending instead of which could have so easily been an <UNK> out happy one the attention to detail in the movie was fantastic also i very good solid 7 out of 10 a little slow at times but lets a thinking person see where the characters are coming from
<START> i first saw this when it came out in the theater though only 13 at the time i was an avid reader of hard science science fiction stories the technical <UNK> of the film are burned into my memory br br some of the following may have significant spoilers br br even as a <UNK> i knew the premise is silly the rocket takes off for a <UNK> mission in a <UNK> where there is always a <UNK> effect on the crew though loose objects <UNK> as in zero gravity and because of that the cabin the area with the controls whatever they called it was to maintain the correct <UNK> so that when they landed why didn't they land standing on their heads and where at least in near earth space the rocket <UNK> had to be running continually with <UNK> <UNK> away without an when the <UNK> quit the rocket stopped dead in space and couldn't start going until a <UNK> <UNK> determined it needed at a little this time the rocket <UNK> it had momentum and the next thing our heroes know they're near mars even a 13 year old nerd knew such a minimum energy trip would take over 200 days br br they land find the air was <UNK> though at the time scientific data revealed that the pressure even if the atmosphere were pure <UNK> would be too low to do any good they decide to camp outside the ship and even build a <UNK> they come armed even though they were supposedly going to the moon where <UNK> wouldn't be needed br br they get a sight of a <UNK> civilization encounter stray martians who look just like people develop an anti nuclear war philosophy and those who survive try to get back to the home planet and die in the attempt by crashing on the earth to do that would require such a long <UNK> period they'd have died of <UNK> long before approaching their destination br br the film it <UNK> destination moon used real science most effectively even though their rescue with the <UNK> tank forgot about the moment arm from the <UNK> center of gravity to the <UNK> <UNK> this film showed <UNK> ignorance of even the most basic science only the most <UNK> illiterate should think of it as a science fiction film it's on a par with the old flash gordon serials where their took off from their and <UNK> in <UNK> and whose <UNK> were always on br br the story on this one i considered banal and i can recommend this only as a film to be shown to students for them to pick out technical <UNK>
<START> see no evil is the first film from wwe films yes wwe word wrestling entertainment pro wrestling of course being that it's a wwe film a wrestler has to star in it the wrestler being glenn <UNK> aka kane which is not really important as if you didn't know kane or what wwe stood for you would never know it had anything to do with the wild word of wrestling as the movie has nothing to do with wrestling see no evil is gross out horror film it has some moments were the some people may jump but for the most part it's just saying hey look how gross we can get not that there is anything wrong with that <UNK> <UNK> played by kane is sort of a jason type character his mother tortured him as a kid with strict understatement christian beliefs and has <UNK> his mind now he's a big scary <UNK> killing machine 90 of the movie takes place in an abandon hotel where <UNK> stalks six teenagers surprised and a handful of adults i could explain why they are in a creepy old hotel but eh who cares despite it's lack of originality see no evil is well made for what it's supposed to be kane plays an awesome killer and needs little make up to be scary one flaw in the movie is the most annoying possibility people survive i really looking forward to having them being horribly killed but alas does not happen i wish the film didn't have the <UNK> of wrestling attached to it although like i said the film has nothing to with wrestling people are still closed minded enough not to want to see it because given of course if they are a wrestling <UNK> then again the movie may also make money because wrestling fans will want to see it either way see no evil has top notch effects and little cgi and like i said it's quite brutal so like i say it's good stuff if you like that sort of thing
<START> pierre plays a don <UNK> character unable to speak living in a world <UNK> with modern life he <UNK> to his <UNK> <UNK> helmet <UNK> and <UNK> made out of seat <UNK> and <UNK> office furniture just as don <UNK> <UNK> the man rides his <UNK> literally <UNK> the lost lives caught up the harsh and <UNK> modern world <UNK> above the earth away from the plight of modern man both characters ride in search of adventure in an effort to right the <UNK> of the world both characters are guardian knights of values unfamiliar to most of the other characters in the story br br unlike tale in this movie we identify more directly with the <UNK> ideals of the main character we can only compare this alien and <UNK> landscape to the lush and beautiful world we live in our frame of reference is the fantasy realm which the lone knight perhaps remembers our vision would be one which expects the main character to triumph to <UNK> to change his world for the better back into a world of plenty that no longer exists br br we look at this movie and see a true knight among a world of humans as animals don <UNK> considered himself a true knight among animals br br with tale we can only see the <UNK> without really understanding the scope of his <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> and tale we see the new world from the eyes of don <UNK> because we value the same visions and ideals as the <UNK> main character
<START> i loved this film a must see for any rod <UNK> fan producer suzanne and director stewart have brought us a true family film that touches the soul an incredibly well put together movie with a beautiful soundtrack
<START> all i can say after watching the dvds of the first season is that i can not believe nbc green <UNK> this show it's so different than what's currently in <UNK> save for lost those who miss the x files just may have a worthy <UNK> not as mysterious or intense as lost i find it to be overall more entertaining br br this kind of extended story is hard to make i mean it could <UNK> into childish <UNK> if most of the elements do not <UNK> together but <UNK> they do and i think the cast is excellent the writing sharp the location and props first rate and the special effects very good for a television budget sure it pushes what is plausible but as it does it never gets so silly as to insult your intelligence br br <UNK> is that this is great sci fi drama for the entire family i doubt it will be a classic with a long run like x files but in the meantime i recommend getting the dvd if you missed it like i did the first time around this fall my must see shows has just <UNK> by one more series br br ps i just heard it got <UNK> from nbc here's hoping sci fi picks it up
<START> save some very early norris <UNK> <UNK> has nothing to offer which can't be found ten <UNK> better on any broadcast channel a pathetic attempt at film making this is one of the worst films i have ever seen in spite of that i did watch it <UNK> the fast forward button because the acting was so awful it was comical of course the film is supposed to be an action drama but turned out as a <UNK> on how not to make a movie everything which could be wrong with film is on screen in this dog if you happen across it give it a <UNK> it's so bad it's funny
<START> this is the worst movie <UNK> ever seen and i have seen lots of movies me and my friends rented this one a evening man we had lots of fun this movie is the worst most boring crap <UNK> ever seen but it makes you laugh u will lay on the floor rolling around to get some air you wonder why just rent it and check for the keyboard playing girl at that sleazy russian bar my mother would make a 1000 times better movie about her the cats
<START> while watching this film recently i constantly had to remind myself that it was made in 1957 and in the <UNK> that makes it all the more remarkable many of the cinematographic effects in the film seem cliched in 2002 but they were quite original in 1957 i first saw this film in 1963 when it was first released in the us and i was struck by its originality then now just having seen it 40 years later i have no reason to change my mind
<START> well to do american <UNK> with more money than brains buys a <UNK> villa in <UNK> much more money whilst having to <UNK> over the price she subsequently manages to cook <UNK> for her <UNK> and wander around italy <UNK> with no job or apparent means of support interminable boredom and the inevitable italian lover ensue this is a chick flick in the most <UNK> sense of the term lane acts like an <UNK> clueless teenage <UNK> throughout which <UNK> <UNK> with her seriously <UNK> looks along the way <UNK> into a variety of mostly italian cardboard stereotypes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> among them <UNK> with unnecessary scenes the most ridiculous being a clumsily inserted and pointless recreation of the <UNK> scene in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a similar <UNK> was used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in <UNK> <UNK> norman vastly superior <UNK> to italy and romance <UNK> may be the most <UNK> piece of cinema of the last decade despite its admittedly well <UNK> <UNK> of italy bonus negative point for the <UNK> lover in at the last minute to provide requisite hollywood ending for its targeted audience of oprah <UNK> <UNK> avoid at all costs unless of course you view oprah and dr phil as <UNK> of intelligent <UNK>
<START> east side story is a documentary of musical comedy in <UNK> russia and later in the eastern european satellite comedies with many clips from the films and commentary from the survivors although some of the <UNK> films look <UNK> bad the bright road being a notable exception the films from the sixties actually look pretty good my wife wants to sing the white mouse and midnight <UNK> look particularly entertaining the producers had to <UNK> with the censors who had the power to decide what was politically correct which led to some confusion humorous in retrospect since the people whom the censors were trying to <UNK> were the very people who supported making the films to begin with since musical comedies were fairly rare behind the iron curtain there were only something like forty made in forty years they had a <UNK> effect upon their audiences who made major hits of some of the films br br i notice that the sound for the sixties films was much better the directors often had to make do with <UNK> equipment and <UNK> power <UNK> they had to film in seven minute takes or less and dangerous br br i also notice that west side story seems to have had a strong influence on hot summer the later films may not measure up to <UNK> in the rain but they certainly look like they beat the hell out of bye bye <UNK>
<START> every great romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic leads to lend suspense anticipation and <UNK> to the plot this story falls completely flat in this area there is no conflict at least none that would <UNK> the eventual joining of the two lead characters and so suspense is flat there is no anticipation and there really is no <UNK> at all br br the chemistry between richard gere and diane lane is representative of friendship at best and with the talent of these two particular actors i was quite surprised during the movie i expected them more to play a game of and chat about the weather than see any moving passion br br while i'm a fan of both actors i do believe that the casting in this movie was off or perhaps the direction was off base and it <UNK> their <UNK> the writing was very weak which also might have <UNK> the performances most certainly the script could have used some help from some <UNK> writers who have real experience putting the heat in romance br br this movie may be worth watching on a rainy sunday afternoon but only after it's on the cheap shelf br br sorry diane <UNK> and richard gere
<START> <UNK> is what <UNK> is called in the movie i think he likes it too it's amazing how intelligent people talented even fall in to the same trap br br i really like it's amazing what he has done no one in recent years has come back from the wilderness and made a mark for himself br br and i truly expected a great film what with the budget of 50 <UNK> and the cute actress as intense as is i thought he would <UNK> at a sentimental and an emotional role ironically he is depicted the same but for what care sheer incompetence <UNK> awful acting banal background music <UNK> direction make it a real pain br br <UNK> rule ex how can german police issue public <UNK> on a loud <UNK> in english they communicate among themselves in english unfortunately this incompetence has become the standard in main line bollywood there are some excellent directors but many a bad ones too the worse thing is that the majority just doesn't care br br songs are the only saving grace br br please don't repeat this <UNK> and find yourself a good director low budget no problem br br the villain should really have <UNK> his head instead of the wig you know after all it's a movie
<START> i first saw this short when i bought a random dvd of short films a while ago this is the only short on the dvd i liked but i don't just like it i love it if you spend any amount of time with me you will see it it is beautiful simple and passionate no <UNK> no <UNK> it could have been done with a but don't get me wrong the animation is elegant and insightful this person clearly spent plenty of time with cats but it is simply black and white and then there is writing and the music it is simply beautiful br br i eat chocolate drink wine and watch it over and over again br br nothing else matters i wait for <UNK> to come up with something else
<START> this is one of michael jackson's best music <UNK> ever made vincent <UNK> rap is totally cool and the zombies dancing with michael is totally amazing michael jackson is one of my favourite singers and he is one of the best <UNK> in the world way to go michael
<START> having just seen walt disney's the <UNK> dance on the saturday morning <UNK> as linked from youtube i used those same sources to watch a remake done in technicolor for the columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man <UNK> the colors compared to the earlier black and white are really used <UNK> here and many of the new gags like when one of the <UNK> band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one's off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone are just as funny as the previous short it does get a little <UNK> near the end still <UNK> <UNK> is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier silly <UNK>
<START> in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who had recently moved from head of production at warner brothers was trying to get his newly created company 20th century fox off the ground and on a level playing field with his old bosses at <UNK> and the <UNK> palace at mgm this is my affair was an attempt to cash in on the current success of historical films set around the turn of the century san francisco in old chicago and in retrospect he succeeded quite <UNK> the plot is fascinating a trouble maker but heroic naval officer robert taylor is given a secret assignment by president <UNK> to <UNK> a ring of bank robbers that are <UNK> american <UNK> he finds the gang but falls in love with their female <UNK> barbara stanwyck and must decide between love and duty br br not everything about this vintage film works well but overall it is a good slice of studio film making the plot gimmick would be borrowed by kurt <UNK> for mother night the lead role of that film of the book was played brilliantly by nick nolte and seems quite believable at least within the <UNK> of studio make believe as a fan of old movies i am always thrilled when i stumble upon one that i have never seen and this is my affair was no exception
<START> the movie is precious and cage is a babe br br but will anyone agree with me in saying that the punk representation in this movie is atrocious br br where's the clash the ramones <UNK> social <UNK> the <UNK> sex <UNK> anyone the music is this movie is incredibly disappointing at least they play the cure br br plus <UNK> <UNK> hair and <UNK> br br this definitely looks like a movie about <UNK> the way that a bunch of movie industry <UNK> see <UNK> br br although it's a 90's movie <UNK> punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 1980's just <UNK>
<START> my friend i rented this movie and within the first 5 mins we had no idea what was going on it felt like it should have been over within the first 15 mins it was a terrible movie my little brother could have been a better actor than some of the ones in the movie and the plot if you can call it that was full of holes never would i recommend this movie to my worst enemy yet anybody i actually like
<START> is for sure a great movie i have to give it to <UNK> for a great directing job and a r <UNK> for great songs the camera work is just excellent and is similar to black <UNK> down and saving private ryan i will be shocked if this movie does not win an oscar for best foreign film or even best camera work
<START> why did they <UNK> this movie upon us it seems as though they set out to make this movie a total slap in to anne rice and every self <UNK> vampire chronicles fan it ignores the ground work laid down by interview with the vampire <UNK> the plot of the novel and has stuart <UNK> stumbling around drunk br br stuart is not our <UNK> our brat prince our adventurous rebel with the sense of humor stuart is a second rate boring rip off of dracula in black leather he did not read the books or know the character is he illiterate tom cruise is <UNK> and still he made a point to read the books and know and love <UNK> br br don't kid yourselves it is not a stand alone vampire flick it's trash plain and simple
<START> someone reviewed this movie as a waste of time because he she was expecting the beautiful scenery of brazil and <UNK> but then everything looked washed out or gloomy or something to that effect i believe this person missed the entire part of the film this is reality the point of this movie is to show that life is not indeed ideal and to show what people go through in their lives for family love and survival a young man leaves his <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> brazil to go to <UNK> to visit his mother's home country after her death he discovers that not everything is free and that <UNK> are looked down upon by native people from <UNK> he eventually finds a life a love but the story does not end as expected and this is not a fairy tale story the part that got me most was the ending song honey baby by gal <UNK> it fit so well with the movie especially the ending
<START> this movie will <UNK> not go over well with some because most of the horror is mental but it does have a little something for almost everyone including a couple of really cool <UNK> scenes with aliens the film makes extensive use of alien <UNK> mythology while also showing a bit more intelligence about some <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> than you would expect out of a movie <UNK> is excellent in what had to have been a <UNK> performance
<START> best robot romantic comedy ever using the robots as the romantic characters which leaves short circuit out of this category this was andy <UNK> best effort <UNK> peters shows her <UNK> here with an amazing performance while not a great movie in many areas i'll award it a 9 on guts and <UNK>
<START> huge <UNK> <UNK> tree <UNK> <UNK> fake natives on a pacific <UNK> looking <UNK> like southern <UNK> <UNK> and revenge unlike the silly <UNK> in navy vs the night monsters the is actually a full grown man tree well grown in 2 days <UNK> have <UNK> on those miracle grow <UNK> it comes not from hell but from the grave of a fake native greg <UNK> the zombies of <UNK> <UNK> murdered by the native <UNK> for hanging out with those awful american scientists the scientists include dr william arnold <UNK> andrews hang 'em high beneath the planet of the apes and professor clark john <UNK> war of the <UNK> beast <UNK> out the cast is linda the parent trap as the obnoxious mrs the obvious comic relief <UNK> out an obvious fake cockney accent a stellar cast indeed because his <UNK> wife <UNK> played <UNK> by suzanne <UNK> a helps set him up declares his revenge on her and all of the <UNK> then the dopey american scientists the tree bring it back to life in the name of science allows it to slowly <UNK> about the island killing off everyone who has done him wrong of course we all know that evil monsters carry off fair <UNK> so the grabs <UNK> female scientist dr terry mason tina <UNK> hell on <UNK> bay <UNK> off with her <UNK> ally a good shot with a hits a knife <UNK> in the and it falls over dead into the <UNK> this laughably foolish is one of the all time cheesy <UNK> the is arguably the <UNK> monster in <UNK> history right up there with the <UNK> over built robot from robot monster vs the aztec mummy and the slow carpet monster from <UNK> terror try not to laugh as you watch the toss fake natives down hills into <UNK> dodge spears and <UNK> slowly about the island shady writing wooden performances and sappy direction all point that this <UNK> <UNK> has far <UNK> than bite this tepid pile of wood <UNK> was the last <UNK> from long time editor turned director dan <UNK> who quickly <UNK> into well deserved obscurity following this film you herd it through the <UNK> from the <UNK> first from hell it came is a <UNK> classic <UNK>
<START> as you might not know de is one of most rightfully celebrated writers he was witty he <UNK> no one in his critics and must now be rolling in his tomb and that's not due to this movie being bad which it is but as a result of the treatment <UNK> to one of his <UNK> o crime do <UNK> it's treated like cheap throwaway trash br br when it was <UNK> that this was to be a modern and urban take on the book i feared for the worst normally modern in these <UNK> means taking the liberty to take the p when doing an adaptation to half <UNK> it in the <UNK> possible way and so the moral and social dilemma of a priest having a secret forbidden affair are <UNK> by extra long <UNK> of people dealing drugs and singing hip hop for no particular or <UNK> reason to the plot it's just there like it might very well not have been br br oh and there's lots of sex so you can at least be counting on that when you put this on remember how every movie in the 80's no matter the genre or the tone always found a way to sneak in some nudity if it was a thriller and they had no need for it they simply found a way that when they were capturing a <UNK> he happened to be in bed with a woman that would <UNK> around screaming naked of course when the cops in <UNK> gratuitous is the word i think not that there's anything wrong with nude scenes but here they make the creators of this movie look desperate simply because there's nothing else to the movie it's totally devoid of what do you call it dramatic content
<START> i have seen a few of fred carpenter's movies on showtime pay per view and video dvd and i enjoyed most of these films especially with a few beers carpenter knows how to entertain eddie monroe and murdered innocence are my favorites i recently viewed a <UNK> dvd of eddie monroe and everything from the cast to the storyline and directing all worked smoothly doug <UNK> music score was sensational i enjoyed seeing frank <UNK> new york new york and the wedding singer he is an amazing and very underrated actor but i especially liked the performance of paul who played uncle benny i looked up his acting credits on the imdb and i found out this was his first starring role where has this guy been give fred carpenter credit for discovering great new talent it's only a matter of time you'll be seeing this guy <UNK> with pacino and deniro as i mentioned carpenter knows how to entertain and when your working with a limited budget it is amazing what carpenter can produce i read the <UNK> magazine interview and carpenter has never made a movie for more than 400 000 00 dollars before i watched eddie monroe i saw rocky <UNK> and the good shepherd both great films eddie monroe took me on a ride to a surprised ending because of a very good script good performances from the entire cast craig morris is a movie star waiting to happen and the lead actress jessica was hot great cinematography direction and doug <UNK> music score as i stated i recently seen rocky <UNK> and the good shepherd if i were to write a comment about those two movies i would be saying some of the same things i have stated about eddie monroe the only thing those two very good films don't have in common with eddie monroe they didn't cost a few hundred grand great movie and i didn't even drink a beer
<START> a modern scare film yep it is br br the hippies and <UNK> got together to deliver us a fear film i didn't recognize it when watching it only 2 years ago that it was a fear film but that's exactly what it is br br there's no difference between this film and films the nazi made about us in ww2 and the same films we made about them this is pure propaganda and speaks only to those that believe in aliens 9 11 conspiracy plots <UNK> moon <UNK> peak oil and major <UNK> what i can say is this film does push buttons make you ask questions and ultimately just forget about it it's a scare film so if your <UNK> get in your houses lock your doors and stock up for that nuclear winter we all know is coming when bush <UNK> the chinese into nuclear war
<START> i starred as eugene morris <UNK> in my high school adaptation of the play and this film definitely doesn't live up to the script or the imagination of neil simon i know this play backwards and <UNK> and i can honestly tell you that the acting was off the production was cheesy the changes in the <UNK> script were poorly done if you want to really enjoy this play you should see the actual play not a hollywood movie adaptation the eugene character lacked soul and was overly sarcastic in all he said the other characters were off key as well a general disappointment messy <UNK> to the play <UNK> executed
<START> this exploration of a unique decade in us cinema begins with the fall of one <UNK> out of touch empire and <UNK> with the <UNK> rise of another equally associated with <UNK> and box office <UNK> meet the new boss same as the old boss or as peter fonda observed in easy rider we blew it in between from bonnie and clyde to star wars the young <UNK> some under the <UNK> <UNK> of roger corman were <UNK> under the <UNK> to produce some of the greatest <UNK> of the 20th century while the story is already familiar from peter easy riders raging <UNK> directors <UNK> and <UNK> are less concerned with than in providing a platform for the filmmakers and stars themselves br br everyone from martin scorsese to francis ford coppola and julie christie is interviewed and a <UNK> of well edited clips places the decade in a <UNK> cultural and economic context if their <UNK> are self <UNK> to say the least they're also highly <UNK> funny and revealing making this something of a wet dream director william <UNK> reveals how the original the exorcist poster was to feature a little girl's hand holding a <UNK> <UNK> and the legend <UNK> god's sake help her before he complained former warner bros ' head john recalls that when he first saw robert de niro in mean streets he assumed scorsese had <UNK> a day release for the shoot br br happily a certain amount of hard perspective has <UNK> into the mix as might be hoped from a politically motivated consciousness expanded generation hopper <UNK> there's a lot of real crap in there too julie christie <UNK> that 1970s us cinema was not a good time for women but if <UNK> responds with a <UNK> of to women's movies brief clips of alice doesn't live here anymore they shoot horses don't they and <UNK> we're soon dragged back to the usual male wall <UNK> <UNK> br br the shift from tough socially conscious film making to no risk crowd <UNK> like jaws for <UNK> weary fantasy <UNK> audiences is also documented though a little rushed but kudos too for the inclusion of lesser sung but equally relevant films like panic in <UNK> park and joe we weren't handsome <UNK> bruce dern on his <UNK> but we were f interesting
<START> the core issues at play god satan good evil can be should be tremendously compelling as demonstrated through thousands of works of art music literature film end of days unfortunately is nothing but a cartoon <UNK> acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to <UNK> <UNK> lack of ability and is further <UNK> by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes br br the single compelling scene occurs at the very beginning with the transformation of the gabriel <UNK> character and his subsequent interaction with his wife girlfriend it is both <UNK> charged <UNK> <UNK> the themes the seductive power of evil
<START> i cant explain what a load of rubbish this film is like really i cant its just that bad br br plot crap acting crap budget so low its laughable br br jesus its like the only good thing in this movie is the fact the main character was fairly hot br br the only people i feel that think this movie is good are the ones who took part in the film i'm sure they are not the ones who <UNK> it because there was no money put into this <UNK> to the bit where there heads get <UNK> br br this movie has already wasted too much of my life so i am not going to waste anymore time writing my review for it
<START> the story of pre <UNK> china must be a popular one jet <UNK> hero made the assassination of the king popular br br this is another story made a few years earlier it stars the incredibly beautiful li <UNK> of a geisha <UNK> miami vice as the king's lover who was sent to <UNK> an assassin so that the king could defeat him she <UNK> zhang but falls in love with him br br no matter he is not able to complete the mission anyway as the king knew about him beforehand i suspected he also knew but went anyway br br it was a beautiful story with massive military <UNK> and of course another chance to see li <UNK>
<START> i know it's rather unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece but i am going to anyway i waited for a laugh i tried to give it time i think 20 minutes is long enough to wait in a comedy for a laugh my laugh never came so i gave up br br it's stupid humour not so stupid that you have to laugh though it isn't anywhere near that high grade let me correct that it's just stupid not stupid humour they may have intended for certain scenes to be funny but they weren't i suppose if you were really bored you could somehow blend the movie with a <UNK> and end up with a mildly entertaining experience br br a very pathetic effort
<START> while i rather enjoyed this movie i'll tell you right now that my mother wouldn't it's out there really <UNK> little dark comedy that reads like a fairy tale gone awry br br neat treat with all the cameos too if you want something different look no further
<START> would it surprise you that my ears and eyes almost <UNK> from watching and listening to this awful movie my eyes almost <UNK> from watching the awful animation and insipid <UNK> empty story my ears almost <UNK> from listening to the songs that sounded like they were sung by a chorus of <UNK> monkeys then my brain almost <UNK> because of this film's complete lack of intelligence it's formulaic every step of the way talking animals are one thing but a penguin who can fly just to keep with the dreams can come true <UNK> show some more faith in the children's intelligence please next to rock a <UNK> this is one of <UNK> worst
<START> it's hard to tell the actors from the non actors bad american movies can be spotted by all the youngsters every single line of dialog with you know what bad canadian movies can be spotted by all the youngsters ending every single line of dialog with eh have we learned nothing in a century of filmmaking cannot the entire weight of millions of <UNK> <UNK> on hollywood with scripts and <UNK> in hand rescue us from these horrible tv movies made to order
<START> the french either make pro <UNK> films or anti <UNK> films with a few in between pour le <UNK> is the latter of this genre from the opening credits telling the viewer what music is going to be played and by whom it was who composed you know that you are going to be <UNK> in middle class <UNK> it is an old man's film with an excess of 40's plus people it is also directed by an old man along with an old crew who have nothing to say about life to the viewer the plot is not only banal but preposterous how many films reveal the plot through dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback some five minutes later maybe the director and actors had a low <UNK> capacity in truth their is no <UNK> plot at all it is <UNK> with holes like a good piece of french cheese br br whether intentional or not it is a film about the <UNK> at least a third of the film focuses on the piano and the pretentious <UNK> <UNK> in each scene i <UNK> it has some well framed shots though they couldn't have used a steady <UNK> in this film it would have woke them all up other than it being a nonsense story the film allows the upper middle class to parade their values and vanity in a very comfortable swiss location a telling line of the film is when <UNK> <UNK> tells anna that she need not lock her car while in the resort oh dear me br br on the dvd miss <UNK> makes a comment about <UNK> a false tear for a scene <UNK> she says like they do in the american actor's studio i think miss <UNK> and the rest of the cast could learn well from the actor's studio br br if there is one statement that stand out in my mind it is when <UNK> remarks <UNK> are having friends for the weekend and all the servants are <UNK> no doubt they had all escaped from the mind numbing set <UNK> they be associated with such an appalling film br br safety medical note in the film they show a hot water being covered with <UNK> and a <UNK> this should never be done only cold water should be used br br minus 10 marks
<START> the final frames of the original american <UNK> provide one line <UNK> of the <UNK> of the film's four central male characters while somewhat sexist in <UNK> the female characters the ending of the original film provided all the information about those people that even the most <UNK> fan of the movie would want however someone felt that mega bucks could be made by <UNK> the dreary lives of these characters after the original film ended bad move making an insurance salesman and his wife a nerdy private in vietnam a drag race driver and a <UNK> hippie into interesting characters in interesting situations was far beyond the talents of those who wrote this nearly unwatchable movie while most of the original cast is back with only richard dreyfuss having the good sense to stay away more american <UNK> is a mess of silly situations that involve <UNK> car races country singers and the vietnam war the use of split screens once thought innovative and daring is <UNK> here to the point of distraction and adds confusion to the already confused goings one this is a sequel that demonstrates nearly everything that can go wrong with a sequel perhaps it should be screened in film schools as a lesson even the use of period music which was a delight in the original is poorly done here if you want more american <UNK> see the original twice
<START> without a doubt one of the most <UNK> <UNK> films i've ever seen with the prejudice being <UNK> against hayden <UNK> as she has to move into a tough inner city school she is constantly called white girl and other <UNK> based on her colour firstly would this be allowed the other way around if a black girl was the butt of all the abuse and secondly the stereotyping of the ethnic kids from the inner city school is also a disgrace the writers apparent desire to show they were hip also extended to missing the point that the inner city school win the <UNK> competition not through talent but by <UNK> their white opponents these overtones to the film took it away from it's expected direction of a harmless lighthearted comedy suitable for a family audience into a vehicle that does none of the participants any credit hayden <UNK> has star quality but i would be surprised if any of the rest of the class ever get much further all in all a <UNK> film that was a waste of time
<START> i thought this movie was brilliant it was so funny and so true too a great idea for a movie five groups of friends on their way to i've got to say that matt <UNK> as mason was probably my favourite character i wish i could give this movie more than a 10 rating
<START> i can't remember when i've seen a worse movie the acting was overwrought the dialog trite to the point of being painful to listen to the special effects second rate and the overall story laughable br br i've never wanted to walk out on a movie more and if i'd been alone that's what i'd have done about 30 minutes into it and saved myself nearly another two excruciating hours of <UNK> inducing dialog and a plot with more holes than a swiss cheese the size of texas i just can't what a miserable experience sitting through this waste of perfectly good celluloid was br br
<START> don't tell me this film was funny or a little funny it was a complete disaster and one of the worst movies i've ever seen ali g is only funny on channel <UNK> ali g show after watching his performance all i can say is he is not made for movies with a <UNK> script or more like no storyline there's nothing to keep you entertained full of annoying unrealistic character's this movie is a complete garbage all the way at the end of the film ali g gives a speech he mentions if you hated this film tell people it was good not even the speech could save the movie he probably knew its gonna be a stinker i would of given this a 0 10 but the minimum start is 1 overall don't even waste your time on this rubbish
<START> i've read anne frank the diary of a young girl when i was in high school and found myself completely <UNK> in her story and also in the broadway play of her life in the secret br br however i'm a little <UNK> about how people have perceived her diary and of her as a person seeing her as a little saint or having a message of hope for the world i don't think that was the original intention of her diary she wrote it mainly for herself even though she did make some <UNK> <UNK> before the <UNK> of the secret were betrayed <UNK> it to be published someday br br but i never saw her as a saint or as a <UNK> of hope but as a very talented writer who could express her thoughts very well and very <UNK> in a diary no doubt she was a very engaging writer and she did possess an extraordinary talent with expressing herself fully with words you really got to know her well through her diary but the importance of her diary lies in the fact that it is a testament and an important historical document of the proof that the holocaust did happen br br it also brought the tragedy of the holocaust closer to home to lose someone that we could put a familiar face and personality to at such a young age literally having had her young life ripped away from her and from the other <UNK> who were murdered in the holocaust it's a <UNK> <UNK> of the nazis <UNK> murder of over 6 million jews and that should not be forgotten br br but it's sad to me that her diary is being so <UNK> as anything more than that when i look for hope i have the bible the first most widely read non fiction book in the world god's words in the bible is eternal but <UNK> diary is a diary of a young girl under extraordinary circumstances and that is it she is not someone to be <UNK> or <UNK> because she was an ordinary girl with many flaws who possessed incredible talent as a writer and who died at age 15 from in the <UNK> concentration camp she was a victim of the holocaust and as this otherwise excellent documentary has so vividly <UNK> she was hitler's most famous victim br br besides the anne <UNK> story the stories from her family members and friends and survivors of the holocaust were engrossing vivid and powerful i especially enjoyed <UNK> and marvel that she is still strong and alive today hannah <UNK> was also very interesting and i also liked hearing from otto frank but i also agree that the moving picture of the young girl with the dark hair and the familiar big eyes at the end was particularly memorable br br another thing about the holocaust that i kind of disagree with the documentary is that i don't believe it was just a matter of <UNK> but rather something deeper and more profound and that was just an act of pure evil pure evil nothing else but pure evil br br excellent documentary of anne frank and of the holocaust that should be watched
<START> although many have mixed feelings about this latter day giallo thriller from <UNK> it still stands as another lavish testament to the cinematic brilliance that is <UNK> br br a young opera singer has her first break out performance and suddenly finds herself the subject of obsession for a crazed maniac br br in a way opera is like a modern day giallo take on phantom of the opera <UNK> with all the glorious style and color that one would expect <UNK> <UNK> to deliver <UNK> makes terrific use of inventive camera techniques <UNK> symbols like those <UNK> gothic atmosphere and truly gruesome murder sequences one scene especially which involves a <UNK> hole and a gun will knock viewers right out of their seats story wise the film also manages to be gripping with some strong suspense and given great atmosphere by <UNK> <UNK> gorgeous music score br br the cast does some satisfying performances <UNK> is good as our leading lady the late ian <UNK> does a nice turn as the director as does as an investigator daria as agent and william <UNK> as ill <UNK> lover br br opera is terrific latter day <UNK> and perhaps the last of his great works it's sure to please his fans and even create some new ones br br out of
<START> <UNK> is an extremely <UNK> movie based on colin wilson s novel the space vampires the script ignores most of the novel s concepts and structure indeed it owes more to the <UNK> serials than the novel but the scenes it does leave in from the novel are nearly identical to those in the film and talking of the script it must be one of the most uneven in cinema history it s though it was written in chapters by several different people take for instance <UNK> he disappears after the early <UNK> scenes which led me to believe he was dead then he turns up again halfway through the film in order to explain the plot to the <UNK> brits and it s this lack of attention by the screenwriters that <UNK> the film and there s plenty of other clumsy scripting such as the heroes returning to london in a helicopter and not <UNK> it has been over run by zombies <UNK> they re flying over it br br i could go on at great length about these plot holes but <UNK> is actually enjoyable to watch as long as you don t use your brain it s good to see a sci fi horror film from an era when aliens were portrayed as being cute creatures that children <UNK> in their <UNK> so that nasty human adults <UNK> t get their hands on them the special effects and <UNK> are very very good there s lots of action and stunts and <UNK> features one of the most memorable aliens in the form of the space girl when mentioning <UNK> in conversation with males it s always a race to say seen the alien in <UNK> she can suck the <UNK> out of me anytime hardly surprising looking at the <UNK> of the votes that this film is more popular with males than females br br don t worry a naked girl can t escape from here can t she pity br br

<START> there wasn't much thought put into the story line on many <UNK> this is a good action movie but that's about it br br the movie states that the were kept to protect the vampires during the day yet they are kept in <UNK> and have <UNK> on their <UNK> so they can't turn into their wolf form or do anything any other slave can't do how does this protect the vampires during the day who are they protecting the vampires from the <UNK> the slaves in human form are nothing more than <UNK> br br my understanding is that vampires are <UNK> and don't age yet <UNK> ages from child to adult do they just stop aging at a certain age i understand that <UNK> is old because he was turned as explained in the second movie but vampire babies age strange br br i didn't realize that vampires needed <UNK> to see at night yet we see them carrying <UNK> throughout the movie br br silver was the only thing that was supposedly able to harm yet wooden fired from the huge <UNK> kill the too br br these are just some of the things that show just a lack of thought put into the story telling
<START> despite the excellent cast and the potential of the story this movie fails on many levels i was convinced that the director was a <UNK> the movie is very poorly edited shows a lot of non important and annoying flashes has very visible goofs and has no suspenseful atmosphere whatsoever the question which repeatedly popped up in my mind while watching this was so what i couldn't care less about the protagonist and what happens to him it's not that the story isn't compelling it's simply the way it's told the movie tells the story period it's like an actor who <UNK> his lines without knowing what he's saying the movie simply tells the events that happen without any soul and the director's to blame he doesn't know how to make something interesting or suspenseful or enjoyable and believe me i'm not somebody who wants to see die hard 8 or 2 fast 2 crappy on the contrary i especially like slow paced movies so i was convinced the director was a <UNK> but to my <UNK> this man has years of experience and has worked as a cinematographer or camera assistant on a lot of marvelous productions guess he had a bad year back then
<START> last fall of 2001 i took a film class that was taught by the director of this movie mark his vast knowledge of filmmaking his ability to <UNK> any scene of a film and his winning of an academy award in some obscure category seemed to give him more credibility than your average independent film director when he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called full ride and was in the post production stages my interest was <UNK> however that would be the last i would ever hear of that film project until last week br br last week i saw in a tv listing that full ride was going to be showing on the wb network this immediately raised a red flag as i can't help but associate wb with <UNK> shows such as <UNK> creek <UNK> etc plus the fact that full ride was going to be released straight to tv wasn't too <UNK> in itself but nevertheless i set aside that time and sat down to watch my former film <UNK> creation br br after two hours passed and the end credits began to roll i thought long and hard about what i had just seen what i had just seen was a typical wb quality show stretched out to the length of two hours in fact it almost seemed as if this movie was made with the sole intent of only showing on the wb network <UNK> this movie will basically be like <UNK> a typical wb show br br where to begin the characters are shallow the story is cliche in every sense of the word the scenes are completely contrived and the character development is forced and unbelievable this movie just screams unoriginal ' br br the main character matt is some hot shot from the wrong side of the tracks literally who plays solid high school football as a but then <UNK> off into a life of crime he is then offered a chance at a full ride <UNK> instead of going to jail obviously without much of a choice he agrees to play football with an all star football team but is not <UNK> among his peers because of his poor team spirit and bad attitude br br then comes the love interest of course where would this predictable <UNK> be without a love interest she comes in the form of amy <UNK> played by the beautiful meredith monroe she is actually a likable character as opposed to the ever so <UNK> matt so we almost applaud her when she rejects him at first but of course the inevitable comes to pass she falls for him changes his attitude towards everything and all seems good and happy but now it's time for conflict br br earlier in the movie amy makes it clear to matt that she doesn't want to score with him because it would be to her and her mother this is much to <UNK> <UNK> and his football buddies yes they eventually warm up to him who bet him he wouldn't get any but of course matt eventually comes to accept these terms and decides he's not all about the <UNK> here's where the exciting plot <UNK> if you don't want me to ruin this surprise then skip ahead br br begin spoiler br br matt finds out from some local guys that apparently amy <UNK> always tries to score with a guy each year from the all star team so that she can try to use him to escape her small town life of working in a <UNK> which is <UNK> in the first place and make it to the big city suddenly realizing he's been used and that his love was a <UNK> matt it tempted to turn back to a life of crime and leave the football camp before the big game ' amy tries to <UNK> him that she was really in love this time but he's too hot headed to buy it so what will matt do will he take her back or will he go back to robbing gas stations and being an all round jerk i won't ruin the super ultra surprising ending for you br br end spoiler br br so if i somehow got you <UNK> up for this movie please realize that that was my sarcasm and not genuine enthusiasm this movie is an uninspired version of <UNK> <UNK> or summer catch ' and that's not saying much there's hardly any comedy to save it and the characters are too shallow to care about so what do you have left not a whole lot br br what i most disliked about the movie was how much of an <UNK> picture painted of <UNK> through this film it seems like he was trying to capture the essence of rural <UNK> and teenage life in the small towns but his approach is all too stereotypical and shallow the characters' high hopes for making in the big <UNK> and the actions they take to do so are greatly exaggerated and it only further <UNK> the stereotype of being a bunch of <UNK> living in farm <UNK> i am unsure of whether or not intentions were good in trying to put his home state in the spotlight but i think he ended up with a very shameful product if wanted to portray <UNK> in a <UNK> light he should have taken a note or two from alexander payne while payne simply chooses to use <UNK> as a backdrop for his films <UNK> it into the plot of full ride and becomes so <UNK> in his awareness of where he's shooting that he ends up <UNK> out superficial garbage that would seem to come from an <UNK> if actually lived here you'd think he'd know better than that br br all in all i am completely disappointed in first big film and i hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little bit of originality to create something different and thought provoking
<START> i really enjoyed this epic thought not quite so much as the english patient a modern day classic the first 20 minutes or so feel awkward but as jude law <UNK> on the journey back to his love <UNK> nicole kidman the film picks up in leaps and <UNK> and it becomes a very memorable thoughtful romantic drama apparently it is <UNK> to hate kidman at the moment but i don't agree at all and she does well here i actually think that the romance between and <UNK> is <UNK> developed in the script they really don t get much screen time together to develop a relationship but law and kidman give it their all and convince <UNK> journey is the <UNK> of the film she becomes a strong woman who can bear almost anything <UNK> at first seems all wrong as ruby but she grows on you after all and <UNK> in many of her later scenes the film has beautiful photography and set design but never really captures the true feel of a period piece jack white in particular has long hair and a pale that look completely out of place with the setting cillian murphy fans will enjoying seeing the talented irish actor in an early bit part and natalie portman actually proves she can act in probably the film's most striking sequence it's a pity that in the other <UNK> girl she's so <UNK>
<START> this film has some rather shocking scenes and subject matter considering it was made in 1971 br br clint eastwood <UNK> page and elizabeth <UNK> do excellent work in the film as do all the cast members br br set during the civil war the film begins when a wounded <UNK> soldier johnny portrayed by clint eastwood is given <UNK> and help at a girls academy located in the south br br the <UNK> of the school ms farnsworth <UNK> page the one teacher <UNK> elizabeth <UNK> and a small group of half grown girls have been without a man in their midst for perhaps a little too long br br while their <UNK> lay with the <UNK> their emotions and physical needs definitely lead them in the opposite direction johnny immediately uses his <UNK> charms to try to win the women over to his side and keep them from turning him over to the br br however feelings previously <UNK> by incestuous behavior an <UNK> father a brutal rape and adolescent <UNK> combined with <UNK> turn things upside down with some unexpected consequences for both johnny and the <UNK> residents br br 10 stars
<START> we all seem to be in <UNK> it was an excellent show and let die way before it's time i've decided that if i really enjoy a show it's often the kiss of death i love the quirky ensemble cast shows and a great setting always helps i really expected to see a lot of these stars in other television productions but short of <UNK> who played fisher <UNK> crazy girlfriend i've not seen many of them except in occasional cameo roles what a shame br br key west northern exposure <UNK> girls and <UNK> mars all great shows all sadly gone before their time br br hear us loud and clear we want key west on dvd please
<START> with all the shoot em up blood horror movies that have come our way in the last little while saw saw 2 the hills have eyes yes they have their place don't get me wrong i went to see when a stranger calls with my buddy the other night why because it's a remake of the 1979 classic which at the time was excellent and scared the you know what out of everyone i didn't know what to expect however i was pleasantly surprised it was a film made of mood atmosphere suspense because remember people what you can't see what you think you see what you can't hear or what you think you hear is far more scarier then what you do if you love films with mood creepiness suspense and atmosphere you'll love it it brought it back to the roots of the original halloween thumbs up a solid 8 5 out of 10 remember folks it's well done not perfect it's spooky not bloody it's creepy not gory it was nice to see a film come a long like this our minds have been <UNK> and <UNK> by the <UNK> and shock value of modern day horror movies we forget what's really scary
<START> what a dreadful movie the effects were poor especially by todays standards but that was forgivable what was unforgivable was the terrible <UNK> of every <UNK> <UNK> breaks disaster movie ever made into this piece of trash the acting was awful and i mean awful the point in the story where michelle green stops to rescue a dog from the approaching <UNK> was hilarious they see the water approaching and run for their lives by the way they had to find a very old fat dog so as to not make ms green look to <UNK> they manage to the water for some time before taking <UNK> what speed later a <UNK> car is not fast enough to escape the <UNK> god she and that dog did run fast if you want to watch a good movie about a <UNK> breaking this isn't it entertainment turn out some good family films but this time they just missed the mark

<START> this movie was well acted and kept my interest in the main character for the entire movie <UNK> <UNK> lived an extraordinary life imagine if <UNK> were alive today this movie paints a picture of what <UNK> life might have felt like it was interesting to see how connected was growing up i would have liked to seen more detail on <UNK> his and his relationship to bob but all in all this movie was well done well acted and the story touched on many <UNK> of a life that was full of many events that were larger than life br br this movie is worth renting

<START> i saw this in a preview and it seems to have not been released in the u s nonetheless it was one of the more enjoyable little comedies it concerns the rivalry between two funeral directors in a small british town the plot of the movie gets a little out of hand in the third act but the characters are very enjoyable and memorable br br the acting is great across the board sure to be overlooked in the <UNK> of blockbusters this is a movie worth looking out for i know i will try to catch this in the theaters again and or buy the video
<START> batman returns is to be considered quality when one speaks of superhero films its predecessor batman in my opinion is by far the greatest and most well thought out of the comic book genre for one to say that batman returns was disappointing he or she has not fully watched the movie and considered the acting of danny <UNK> as the penguin <UNK> and walken offer some memorable moments the tale of batman is suppose to be dark and tim burton has <UNK> how the comic portrays batman batman returns provides comic relief action suspense and fantasy and it should not be viewed as <UNK> although we are all entitled to our own opinions
<START> originally the <UNK> was planned as a four part serial and it shows i dislike serials they're typically ridiculous convoluted and banal this one is no exception in the first part of the <UNK> 'the golden lake ' a rich <UNK> <UNK> the plans of a gang of criminals the <UNK> to steal gold from <UNK> a silly love triangle ensues with some <UNK> and indians action the <UNK> and <UNK> of it didn't entertain me br br one can <UNK> trace themes from this two part series to <UNK> later far superior work and the film making is better than in other serials i've seen from this time including <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the <UNK> the camera isn't as static and this film is fast paced thankfully the <UNK> and lighting are adequate too none of that's remarkable though it's nearly <UNK> however in how closely this series resembles louis serials the criminal gang dresses and behaves like those in <UNK> <UNK> only the names and to a lesser extent the situations have changed br br for the further comments on the <UNK> series see the web pages for it
<START> many people are making fun out of steven <UNK> acting abilities and i really see why if i remember fire down below well ok his other films are acceptable regarding to his acting br br after reading reviews about the <UNK> i didn't expect anything from this film i barely came through fire down below and i read a lot that the <UNK> was even worse so i was really surprised about this one in my opinion it is one of his very best movies if it had have more action sequences and a couple more fighting scenes it would be the best i liked the story the directing and the actors belle was just incredible she will have a great movie career in the future the few action scenes were very well made and steven seagal was very believable in his unusual role
<START> this is my favourite indian movie of all time it is comic genius salman khan is hilarious but <UNK> khan steals the show with his witty dialogue <UNK> <UNK> outfits tell a story of their own makes you wonder if the <UNK> deliberately made her wear some of the clothes just to make the movie funnier at one point she looks like she's wearing a <UNK> is the only comedy genre movie to make me laugh from the beginning till the very end there is not one dull moment every scene is hilarious even the songs and dance moves will have you in <UNK> of laughter i especially loved the scene in which <UNK> <UNK> khan his i've seen this movie so many times i've lost count and i'm so glad to say that this time bollywood can take all the credit for this fantastic movie as far as i know a a a it is not a <UNK> of a hollywood movie thank god overall i recommend this movie to anyone who understands hindi <UNK> and loves good comedy br br watch it you'll love it
<START> nothing about this movie stands out as either being great or terrible br br in the end that is what kills it the <UNK> is just not good i can't say i expected better from will smith but i definitely did from kevin james of the king of queens but hey i'm getting used to saying that a lot lately this film attempts to make its mark as a witty romantic comedy but it never hits the <UNK> eye in fact it never hits anywhere within the target the <UNK> scene is disturbing the fact that kevin james can't dance is something that wouldn't exactly catch anybody off guard and is therefore in a movie like this not funny this movie constantly tries to win your heart but always with the wrong <UNK> at the wrong time some parts are okay but i'm searching my brain for examples but i really think this movie should be avoided
<START> i can appreciate satire that goes against my own views but it must be witty and well placed this film is how can i possibly explain it it does not make the slightest attempt at subtlety much less intelligence in fact it's hardly even horror dead soldiers come to life but they're not interested in brains only in voting why cue a never ending stream of the most idiotic banal <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of bad president bad <UNK> bad <UNK> what a self indulgent <UNK> <UNK> piece of <UNK> <UNK> this was br br even if they agree with the <UNK> points only the stupidest of <UNK> would say they enjoyed watching it then again <UNK> a degree of stupidity to the crazed angry hostile anti social and anti anything halfway normal liberal spectrum is a tall task in itself br br avoid like a liberal convention
<START> garden state was a mediocre film at best the film seems more like a <UNK> of thoughts that the writer <UNK> had rather than a cohesive story the disjointed plot may have been more engaging if it weren't interspersed with pointless scenes that were nothing more than quirky <UNK> these scenes are often the ones that are <UNK> in conversation <UNK> walking past that turn on as he passes crazy under <UNK> party scene shouting over a <UNK> the list goes on br br the main character is flat and ultimately unlikable which is <UNK> most in the scene where he talks to his father <UNK> ignoring his fathers problems including a recently deceased wife and <UNK> on about his own what am i to do with my life problem br br the film ends when andrew <UNK> decides not to go back to la because he cannot tear himself from the love of his life sam natalie portman whom he has known for 2 days which can only lead me to the conclusion that the message of the film is that love at first sight <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sure you could interpret it as a of <UNK> but if that is the case it could have been done better much better br br this film does not know what it wants to be a drama a comedy a teenage <UNK> film or a gamut of other things i say this not as a single genre oriented person but as a person who loves multi genre pieces such as those <UNK> by stanley kubrick the reason i feel it does not work for garden state is because rather than <UNK> the genres together it jumps around one scene is one genre the next another and back again so on br br i have heard many people tell me to cut <UNK> some slack after all it was his first feature film and he <UNK> as director writer and lead actor impressive as it was a first film i should think that with as much money as he has he could do better there have been much better first time feature film directors michel <UNK> human nature david gordon green george washington maybe if he stuck to writing or directing or acting it would have been better <UNK> is a talented performer maybe his second attempt won't be so tedious and disjointed
<START> ok well i guess it was worth my time sitting through this once but i won't be watching it again there are several things about this film that irritated me br br first man i really hated the characters i had the same problem with sid and nancy i have a hard time spending a fair <UNK> of time following characters who i really don't care about and can't relate to it's not that the actors or the writing were technically bad it was that the characters were written in such a way that i just had contempt for them and as the movie went on i almost wanted to see the sky fall on them and this leads me to the second problem and a question which i think is at the heart of this movie was the intent to simply document this generation and these types of <UNK> who were i guess wandering around europe in the 60s was the intent to criticize and <UNK> them or was this film some kind of a warning my final <UNK> of the film that is to say in <UNK> if there was anything <UNK> here at all <UNK> on this question br br regardless these characters are really unlikeable and as a consequence it's hard to really give a crap about the plot or what happens to them if this was some sort of statement on this generation then the film becomes a little more tolerable it is clear that <UNK> is not some kind of <UNK> establishment square so the way he proceeds here carries more weight than say the countless stupid <UNK> films set in or concerning the 60s <UNK> br br at bare minimum this film has two things going for it first the soundtrack obviously i like how is used here and others have mentioned it too as it takes the <UNK> in the movie i am guessing that if you are a pink <UNK> fan and want to see it for that reason nothing you read here is likely to stop you from watching it anyway it wouldn't stop me either the curiosity of hearing pink <UNK> in a movie may be enough to just barely get you through this br br secondly there is some nice scenery <UNK> looks like a nice place to visit maybe i'm just sick of looking at los angeles new york and chicago in films but european films which take the time to actually show us europe the beautiful or the ugly mostly beautiful here are always welcome br br but i really see no particular genius here no revolutionary camera work not even a moral tone message sensibility or plot that has anything new to say perhaps what was revolutionary about this was merely that it came from a guy like <UNK> a film critical of a mindset that at least in part made his movies <UNK> to that extent it is an honest film there's no <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> of the 60s here which is perhaps something you might expect in fact the portrayal of the characters in this film closely mirrors the somewhat distorted in my opinion modern cultural memory of that generation br br oh yeah bunch of yawn nudity and sex here nothing new if you watch these kinds of movies from this time period i guess it was considered novel or provocative or something at the time i don't find it offensive or <UNK> i doubt you will either rather it just <UNK> the running time of an already tedious film in its own way this particular use of sexuality in movies of the time especially european ones has become a bit of a clich√© but i guess in <UNK> you can't blame them they were just in that decade able to get away with it and i suppose i'm guessing here the very presence of this kind of graphic sexuality was a political or social statement in and of itself that being that sexuality was a part of life that this generation wasn't going to be all weird about like their parents were br br should you watch it if you're a pink <UNK> fan sure i guess it's worth a watch in any case the valley is a better film i went into this movie expecting largely what i got if you don't normally watch these kinds of arty avant garde films and don't know what to expect this is bound to be annoying as hell this is a normal healthy reaction br br if you're not a pink <UNK> fan i'm not sure why you'd spend your time here i noticed one fellow who left a comment did enjoy this movie quite a lot so maybe i'm just missing something i don't need guys running in slow motion from <UNK> special effects explosions or anything like that to enjoy a movie but i do need some kind of handle i need to find something to like about a movie and generally i need to sympathize with some aspect of the characters' plight <UNK> that some novel film making will work camera work and so forth here there's just nothing to hold on to except for pink <UNK> <UNK> which is just enough to make this tolerable at bare minimum if you're a pink <UNK> fan to begin with you'll like the bit with i promise
<START> when this show began it was fairly interesting we got to see what <UNK> boat <UNK> had to go through during the <UNK> catching season soon after however it lost focus on the fishing and focused almost entirely on the drama in the lives of the <UNK> episodes became nothing more than 'the captain doesn't like the new this one happens way too often <UNK> is injured or <UNK> 'a <UNK> gets word of some problem at home and is frustrated that he is stuck on a <UNK> repeat i don't know how people can find the <UNK> seasons watchable as every episode seems to be essentially the same as those before and after it this show should be moved to a different channel and <UNK> to <UNK> boat drama or even better it would have made a perfect one time segment on <UNK> jobs br br shouldn't the discovery channel have learned their lesson after american <UNK>
<START> i rented the matrix <UNK> with a friend of mine we both loved the matrix and we both love filmmaking so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of the matrix it turns out that the matrix <UNK> tells you hardly anything about the art of filmmaking or even how the matrix was made it is basically a huge commercial for the matrix a movie that the target audience of the matrix <UNK> has already seen br br if you really want to know about the process and the troubles and the stress and the detail that went into making of the matrix look no further than the bonus features on the original dvd of the matrix there are things they show in those documentaries that i had not even realized had to be done or was done the matrix was such a difficult and challenging film to make that it deserves more credit than a documentary that's about as informative and interesting as an mtv special
<START> this joins the endless line of corny predictable 50's sci fi <UNK> out there as usual it's pretty bad there isn't much of a plot that i could <UNK> and the over exaggeration of the leads only adds to the unintentional laughs the title is misleading also catching this on mst3k is probably the only way for it to be viewed and it's better left that way
<START> i watched this movie which i really thought had a promising beginning but then it just led me to feel disappointed in the end the problem i think with this film was that the director was trying a bit to hard to make this film weird and original there were too many flashbacks and too many bad effects which got me annoyed through the film i love debbie harry and <UNK> hayes but they disappointed me in this film they could of done much better this film seemed promising in the beginning dragging in the middle and then disappointing in the end the film could never beat stanley kubrick's when it comes to controversial matters weirdness and originality in movies
<START> now i'm a big fan of zombie movies i admit zombie movies usually aren't all that good but i like them anyways despite the crappy acting and worthless dialogues that occur in almost all zombie movies this one is by far the worst see there are a few ground rules with zombie movies 1 zombies are <UNK> tactics is seldom used and never do they act like a boxer they don't dodge a blow to the head they take it with a ugly smile they don't try and hit you in the face they grab a hold of your arm and bite it 2 zombies can't speak only in evil dead otherwise they do not speak 3 you don't fight zombies with <UNK> <UNK> weapons you loose in a <UNK> fight against zombies <UNK> are used in this movie however <UNK> is the way to go which is wrong very wrong br br it had no redeeming qualities br br if you wish to see a zombie movie see one with an average score higher than 3 on imdb com
<START> a brilliant film by the great john waters the characters are unforgettable the acting script and camera work only enhance the overall greatness of this film <UNK> as an art form a must see for all easily a perfect 10
<START> although the wonderful <UNK> counter in the local <UNK> no br br longer exists and the clothes are definitely immediate br br post war vintage and good and evil are easy to understand and br br those old planes are really dated this movie will never be dated br br the human <UNK> and problems post war the beautiful br br love stories the wonderful acting especially harold russell and br br dana andrews are as moving today in 2002 as they were in br br i was one of the young women who welcomed our marvelous br br veterans home from world war ii like so many my memories of br br the war years and the are as fresh today as if they br br took place yesterday this movie is very relevant for our times
<START> this is an extremely involving series that is well casted and <UNK> a sensitive subject with great <UNK> we follow michael as the undercover fbi agent set to <UNK> a terror cell lead by <UNK> the series is very well written and has enough plot twists to keep you sitting at the edge of your seat waiting for whatever happens next br br michael is by my definition one of the best actors i've seen portraying an undercover agent cold on the outside but still a good human being underneath trying his best to keep his head <UNK> in a highly emotional roller coaster ride that fbi has had him <UNK> on <UNK> on the other hand comes off a guy that pretty much could fit into any social scenario big and strong but yet able to disappear into the gray mass if so needed highly <UNK> and extremely cunning the way the two communicate on screen is nothing short of spectacular br br the way the story develops and the level of detail that the script offers makes the whole story extremely believable and also very true to life i would imagine it is of such <UNK> that you're left with the feeling of being insecure not knowing what might happen next in real life we read about terror every day and here we are given a good sneak peak into an underworld which most of us know very little about br br it's a series that will for sure have you coming back for more sitting there at the edge of your seat just waiting for next weeks episode to come on it's a sure winner in my eyes and i have no problems stating that this series is on my list of all time best
<START> it's hard to know what to make of this weird little aussie crime flick on the one hand it's an enjoyable little film with a great sense of humour but on the other it just lacks a certain something that <UNK> the film never reaches above it's <UNK> that keeps it trapped within the merely <UNK> territory that being said two hands is a well plotted film that excellently <UNK> several stories at the same time which allows several small <UNK> throughout the movie and that in turn helps to stop the film becoming boring the absurdity of the goings on the thick australian accents and the bizarre set of characters all help to ensure that the film entertains also the plot follows the story of a young <UNK> who thinks he'll go on to bigger things after accepting a job from the local <UNK> he doesn't the job only lands him in trouble when he <UNK> a swim and <UNK> leaves ten grand on the beach which is promptly stolen by a couple of kids who have the time of their lives on a shopping spree however all is not <UNK> for our hero who must find the money or face the consequences br br the film is made up of a cast of <UNK> at least it was back in 1999 as nowadays heath ledger is something of a name he doesn't impress too much here however as his performance is mostly of the one note variety and he doesn't make for a very compelling lead he fits the movie in that he's australian and looks naive but beyond that he's not the best lead i've ever seen in a movie if you ask me bryan brown gave the best performance here he might not have a great deal of screen time but he steals every scene he's in and it's him that provides the movie with a lot of its humour he's got nothing to do with the best sequence however which takes place in the form of probably the most hilarious bank robbery ever caught on film on the whole i can recommend this film to people that enjoy quirky crime films as the weirdness is <UNK> and the way that events take a turn for the bizarre is enjoyable but if you're not a fan of this sort of film i can't really say that two hands will <UNK> your boat it's not a must see but if it's your thing and you get a chance to see it you probably wont completely regret it
<START> a delightful story about two <UNK> has been turned into a nice little film by the bbc most children who like a good story will enjoy this the characters are played really well by a very good cast not sure whether our american friends will appreciate it but they do get a mention as <UNK> lou runs off with a gorgeous american soldier
<START> i had seen this movie just days before halloween 2004 i noticed it around lunch time and it was an interesting description in my menu box so i decided to watch it seriously only a movie only suitable for late night tv you know after conan but before the <UNK> sorta deal br br although this movie has very little to do with <UNK> it does have a lot to do with <UNK> refer to my heading if you need a <UNK> br br i found the idea behind the story absolutely fascinating a hidden nuclear <UNK> a scientist and a believable <UNK> would have been a good start to a cool fantasy but then it goes downhill after 15 20 minutes br br the cast is poor with no memorable performances poor quality queen who has had her breasts <UNK> considering <UNK> don't carry breasts as well as poor sound effects an obvious low budget movie though the cast has tried br br spoiler br br 4 <UNK> stumble upon a hidden nuclear <UNK> while on a job they <UNK> with the buttons and open a <UNK> 2 workers fall into the <UNK> and it <UNK> <UNK> to figure out what is going on the party still in our world seeks help while the other party <UNK> their surroundings br br help does not arrive so they open the <UNK> and follow through meeting up in a parallel dimension they encounter a race of human <UNK> dubbed soldiers after a death and chase they are saved by survivors br br now it gets boring they hide talk a bit try to build another <UNK> then attack the <UNK> after losing 2 more <UNK> they open the <UNK> and escape returning to our world some 200 million years ago br br sounds interesting huh
<START> well i've just seen buster keaton's film debut in <UNK> <UNK> the butcher boy and despite the crude way everything just seems to happen for almost no logical reason i found plenty to laugh at like when buster orders <UNK> from butcher boy <UNK> <UNK> makes buster come back to pay buster says he put it in the bucket that has the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> hat and takes money buster takes hat back on head as it gets stuck <UNK> attempts to remove it while <UNK> fall to floor <UNK> feet are now stuck on floor and so on that probably didn't read funny but on screen it was hilarious as were some more slapstick involving <UNK> being thrown and a later sequence that takes place in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> school with <UNK> dressed in drag and buster helping <UNK> rival also in drag like i said many scenes don't make a <UNK> of sense but the visuals especially those involving <UNK> and keaton are laugh inducing even today recommended viewing for keaton <UNK>
<START> i was aware of man of the year's critical pans and <UNK> gross but was prepared to give the film the benefit of the doubt because i know good pictures can fall under the radar during the crowded release schedule of the fall months br br what i found out was that the movie is surprisingly uninspired surprising is an understatement considering barry <UNK> gift for political satire demonstrated in good morning vietnam and <UNK> the dog and robin <UNK> obvious comic gifts robin williams in fact is mysteriously underused on the making of <UNK> that comes with the dvd barry <UNK> talked about how sometimes he let robin williams <UNK> off the script like it was some naughty secret of his you really that much of a moron barry <UNK> whenever you have robin williams in your film and want to use him for his comic abilities basically every movie he's been in other than insomnia or one hour photo don't cage him within a script let him ad <UNK> whatever he wants because he is the funnier than anything anyone else can write for him and his comic <UNK> can instantly raise the bar on any mediocre movie like <UNK> or <UNK> adams what i found even more <UNK> in his failure to make use of robin williams was that back in 1987 <UNK> used this exact formula to perfection in good morning vietnam <UNK> robin <UNK> bursts of comic <UNK> into a war picture to make a <UNK> political piece br br so the film isn't as much of a laugh fest as it could be and feels <UNK> lost in its tone if the film had potential to work as anything it might have made one of those thrillers from the mid <UNK> in the style of the <UNK> brief the fugitive or one of those jack ryan films its plot centered around an employee at a <UNK> valley company <UNK> a <UNK> in a system that reveals that the country elected the wrong president and the efforts of the <UNK> to eliminate her before the secret gets out so if you replaced robin williams with some harrison ford type actor or perhaps even harrison ford himself added a couple more explosions and maybe that's where the movie was trying to go i'll never really know and it's not worth it to try to find out
<START> this film is outstanding on this date of <UNK> 8 2007 it was on on demand from show time it had been a while since i seen it but it does feature thomas jane in the first role i seen him in at first you see a normal guy that seems kind of <UNK> with a wife that seems close to going her own way the directors cut which i just watched has a opening scene that is cool is dressed as a <UNK> type looking very fresh and hot trying to buy a coffee late at night with no small bills turns violent in a hurry shows that her name on her letter jacket is the real deal meeting up with his old road pal nick played by aaron was cool at first and he even <UNK> him his wife's car to take care of some business then he spots <UNK> silver <UNK> and the day changes for the weird and violent there is a cast of real characters that parade through the next series of scenes but dallas steals the show i think her telling of a <UNK> story to the doctor that is there to get a personal interview in a <UNK> <UNK> is outrageous as a rule i have never thought tall women were that sexy but as with any rule there are exceptions is as one has never seen her before in films sexy and lethal like in the one movie with tom <UNK> but with a never seen before <UNK> if your looking for film to add to your collection this one is worth the price in the nude is worth the price alone but this story has everything one might hope one has love friendship sex and violence in a terrific mix when i first seen it years ago it blew my mind and i know you will feel the same way
<START> unlike the previous poster i liked the celluloid treatment it looked good and made the movie that much more enjoyable to watch to me it didn't detract at all from the power of the <UNK> content in fact i felt the <UNK> of the look allowed me to just lose myself that much more in the content the previous poster was fair to <UNK> the style to a <UNK> commercial it definitely has that look but for my tastes it worked really well and i am far from a fan of <UNK> commercials br br in my opinion this is how documentary film making should be done i can't wait to see the next <UNK> from these promising filmmakers
<START> well that was sure a waste of dave talents wasn't it don't get me wrong when it comes to graphic design dave may be the best in the world right now the layered <UNK> look he can accomplish with just a few <UNK> lines on rough paper make the efforts of people like peter <UNK> and david <UNK> look like what they are has been the godfather of a revolution in the look of comics film even magazine ads which borrow the distinctive <UNK> effect he has <UNK> br br but this movie it's junk complete junk the story from neil <UNK> is unfortunately exactly what <UNK> has been giving us ever since he ripped off clive barker for the first time a pseudo <UNK> overblown <UNK> populated by characters which have titles in all capital letters rather than names everything is allegory to the point that it is impossible to get any human drama emotion or empathy from anyone involved people make <UNK> speaking in <UNK> which bring to mind what <UNK> and <UNK> are dead might have sounded like if tom <UNK> had suffered a <UNK> stroke halfway through its composition really <UNK> get over yourself you're not a prophet you're a <UNK> br br directing doesn't help his pacing is poor taking fully half an hour to actually <UNK> himself up for the main <UNK> plot and then simply providing a <UNK> sequence of events none of them given any weight the monsters don't menace because they're not <UNK> simply thrown at the screen the plot doesn't engage because we don't really care about the <UNK> little protagonists half the dialogue <UNK> into into shirt <UNK> and <UNK> masks is <UNK> br br some of the visuals are pretty and i'm sure the <UNK> will <UNK> it up pity think of the amount of really good work could have produced if he hadn't been stuck with this lame project br br grade d d
<START> guest from the future tells a fascinating story of time travel friendship battle of good and evil all with a small budget child actors and few special effects something for spielberg and lucas to learn from a sixth <UNK> <UNK> nick finds a time machine in the basement of a <UNK> building and travels 100 years into the future he discovers a near perfect <UNK> society where robots play <UNK> and write poetry everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called that allows to read minds of humans and animals the device can be put to both good and bad use depending on whose hands it falls into when two evil space pirates from <UNK> who want to rule the universe attempt to steal it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy nick with the pirates hot on his tracks he travels back to his time followed by the pirates and alice chaos confusion and funny situations follow as the <UNK> pirates try to blend in with the <UNK> alice <UNK> in the same school nick goes to and demonstrates <UNK> abilities in <UNK> class the catch is alice doesn't know what nick looks like while the pirates do also the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone hmm i wonder if this is where james cameron got the idea for terminator who gets to nick and first excellent plot non stop adventures and great soundtrack i wish hollywood made kid movies like this one
<START> if i could give this movie less than a 1 i would certainly do that i had read a review of this film in the la times and i found myself walking by the theater and remembered the review my wife and i were game and we thought it can't be as bad as the critic said you know critics sure enough give me a break with the awful acting horrible camera work poor use of the budget that has been mentioned over and over again as an excuse i've worked on films with smaller budgets that are 100 times better it's the director and the producer that makes films work they choose the teams that's it if they don't put it together and make it work it simply won't so they didn't and it doesn't i don't think they can i just had to take the time to write this review though i'm sure the film crew doesn't appreciate this review i hope i'm doing you all a favor with my wish for you to do well but in another career good luck
<START> running out of time rests somewhere in the middle of johnny <UNK> cannon in the solid good category as a crime thriller it's not terribly original or overwhelming and the action scenes will not blow you away but it has something else going for it it's a johnny to film after all it has to br br andy <UNK> has <UNK> hours to live he decides to play a strange cat and mouse game with a hostage <UNK> of the hk police played by <UNK> <UNK> wan that's the plot in a nutshell on top of that to <UNK> layers of twists and turns that keep proceedings interesting throughout it occasionally becomes too convoluted for its own sake but never lets it get the best of it however just as johnny to is about to hand over a slick and well made crime flick which let's face it are dime a dozen he slips in bits and pieces that bring running out of time alive as a full emotional experience providing the soul and heart to the well <UNK> <UNK> br br the concepts of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in his work are explored in great effect here always subtle letting the images speak for themselves giving them time to develop with long takes and slow tracking shots <UNK> cutting to the score it's all here a small love story in a bus between andy <UNK> and a girl is among the highlights of the film and part of the heart i'm talking about so simple yet so powerful <UNK> for <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> car scenes and the <UNK> room showdown br br however something stops me from claiming running out of time is a masterpiece to has all the ability and down to a notch but he can also be too <UNK> or bland at times when he's good he's real good there are even isolated moment of pure brilliance that are just too good for their own sake leaving a bittersweet <UNK> for the rest of the movie i'm convinced that if he puts his heart to it he can make a really great film as it is this is another one of his films that is flawed but enjoyable underneath the slick hk style it's the black humour and heartfelt drama that makes this a compelling film worth watching definitely
<START> the <UNK> chair was a supreme waste of <UNK> minutes of my life which cannot be <UNK> and spent in a more worthwhile way even the blair witch project was a better use of life's precious moments it must be called the <UNK> chair because only <UNK> could <UNK> the extremely <UNK> self important brothers who it out for public <UNK> and obviously they are so full of themselves that they have assumed the public would actually want to <UNK> their <UNK> the <UNK> chair made the <UNK> boys seem like a cinematic masterpiece valley of the dolls beyond valley of the dolls pink <UNK> texas chainsaw massacre night of the living dead urban cowboy the blob all of these would be a better use of one's time than viewing the <UNK> chair the characters portrayed are either too predictable or too lacking in normal emotional <UNK> to even come close to being likable or believable also at one point in the film while the characters are supposed to be in the same small town if one watches closely one can see that one part of the town is apparently in the southern united states and the other half is located in <UNK> that's some town eh
<START> alan <UNK> emma thompson give good performances with southern new orleans accents in this detective flick it's worth seeing for their scenes and scene with hal <UNK> these three actors to entertain us no matter what the movie it seems the plot for the movie shows potential but one gets the impression in watching the film that it was not pulled off as well as it could have been the fact that it is <UNK> by a rather uninteresting subplot and mostly uninteresting <UNK> really <UNK> things the movie is worth a view if for nothing more than entertaining performances by <UNK> thompson and <UNK>
<START> someone i know said that there was this film called that was probably up my street i was told about this movie after watching final destination 2 and watching the extra feature about near <UNK> experience br br i bought the dvd of at the modest price of 5 pounds got home and watched it and i could not help but smile and feel good wondering how this film hadn't been in my life before the film is about a group of medical students try to see what it's like after near death experience but then there sins come back in reality and can harm them physically br br acting from kevin bacon and <UNK> sutherland is great as you would expect from the pair and joel made this a great movie like he did with the lost boys br br this is an edgy and stylish thriller bound to please <UNK> type of film fan
<START> too bad this movie isn't while nemesis game is mildly entertaining i found it hard to suspend my disbelief the whole length of the movie especially the situations that sara was putting herself into are we supposed to believe that br br 1 this hot chick is going to go <UNK> <UNK> around abandoned buildings and dark subway <UNK> in the middle of the night just to solve some <UNK> br br 2 the protagonists are supposedly such experts that they play <UNK> games for fun but don't put the whole i never <UNK> <UNK> together until the very end and then and then get this she has to do the whole mirror thing to finally put the pieces together i know it was the <UNK> device to show the audience what was going on but do they really think we're that stupid br br 3 when <UNK> and sara go to the <UNK> m to question the blonde there is not one topless chick in the whole building <UNK> c'mon i know it's canada but i would expect more from a country that gave us shannon <UNK> br br and anyone else notice that when <UNK> was surfing the web and found that site that when he over the link the <UNK> stayed an arrow and didn't turn into a little hand like all do when you click on a i mean if you're gonna have the internet play such a prominent role in your movie at least get the little things right <UNK>
<START> <UNK> br br i found that this film was beautifully crafted the cinematography was well above excellent i though almost any frame could be frozen and you would have yourself an exquisite photograph the use of color stands out most in many instances the camera was <UNK> through the scene and the work was flawless br br park chan direction was fantastic he had me believing <UNK> in his far fetched universe there were several touches of verbal and visual humor of a dark nature that just added another depth to the picture as a whole br br the acting i would not call outstanding but it suited the film and worked well enough br br for me the only place where this film lacked was in the story at times i will not lie the goings on between characters just did not make sense sometimes the story flow was clunky overall i was disappointed with the subdued narrative and i felt it ran a little too long br br but i still recommend this film for its vision its visual <UNK> its dark humor and at the end of the day it is an interesting film even if <UNK> 9 10
<START> i was initially interested in this film after reading a synopsis and seeing a few striking <UNK> and the promise was there for a gripping horror film of the <UNK> <UNK> style admittedly i must say that <UNK> films have occasionally been rather incoherent and some feel like a handful of visually <UNK> set pieces loosely strung together with a vague connecting plot br br since <UNK> is credited as writer for this i have to say i'm not really surprised even his masterpiece <UNK> when examined <UNK> the same tendency to string along sometimes unrelated scenes purely for the aesthetic impact however <UNK> also had the benefit of a <UNK> main character and clear <UNK> as well as scenes that contributed ultimately to the eventual resolution br br the church on the other hand has none of these things it has no main character no protagonist whatsoever it furthermore has no real plot to speak of and no <UNK> no climax no denouement and no resolution it is a completely hollow incoherent work that views as if <UNK> sat down and thought <UNK> that would make an interesting scene visually let's do it ' the film is a series of these scenes br br initially it might be interesting and <UNK> direction is excellent i must say cannot be <UNK> for the material as it is made as compelling as possible however such good direction calls attention to the horrible <UNK> of the script and there is absolutely no sense in it the attempt at a central <UNK> plot is nothing more than <UNK> of carpenter's film prince of darkness events happen solely because the script wishes them to and reactions to those events are completely implausible the narrative flow is <UNK> damaged after a point simply because there is no ability to suspend disbelief it's too ludicrous added to this are numerous factual errors that are so <UNK> <UNK> that it becomes embarrassing br br if it had been more overtly artistic and edited down into a different work it might have been chilling or tense if it had been fleshed out into an actual cohesive narrative it might have been gripping but it was none of these the best it managed was confusing and at times <UNK> plots are introduced but never followed characters are forgotten about and altered <UNK> no logic is ever applied to any situation it might have been scary or interesting but to <UNK> that sort of feeling takes more effort on the part of a screenwriter much more br br all in all the church is not worth viewing for anyone but total <UNK> of italian horror that is more style than substance this is <UNK> style at its worst and it is a strong justification for the usual criticism
<START> on a dark gloomy new year's eve night an ill nurse her life slowly away demands that david <UNK> be presented to her at once we don't yet know who david <UNK> is or why this nurse wishes to see him but her only dying wish is to speak with him just one more time on the other side of the town <UNK> <UNK> amongst the <UNK> of the local cemetery <UNK> victor who also directed and two of his drunken associates <UNK> <UNK> the coming of the new year here we can tell just when to drink the new year in <UNK> <UNK> casting a finger towards the large clock tower that <UNK> through the darkness little does he know however that he will not be alive to <UNK> it br br to pass the time <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a ghost story he'd once had a friend name george a merry fellow who was smarter than the rest of us on one new year's eve several years ago george has broken up a potentially disastrous <UNK> <UNK> that the final man to draw his last breath before midnight would be condemned to drive the phantom <UNK> for the next year doing <UNK> <UNK> and collecting the souls of the deceased and gentlemen george died last new year's eve concludes <UNK> happily not bothering to contain his mocking <UNK> of the man's beliefs br br as fate has it of course an unexpected violent encounter results in <UNK> death just on the stroke of midnight as the man's transparent spirit rises <UNK> from his <UNK> body he witnesses to his horror the distant approach of a phantom <UNK> the driver a <UNK> <UNK> figure a <UNK> tightly in his hand steps down from the <UNK> and approaches we are <UNK> to discover that the driver is none other than a <UNK> george preparing to pass on his ghastly duty to this year's <UNK> br br considering the era in which is made the special effects in this film are absolutely superb cinematographer <UNK> used double exposure photography to create the eerie ghostly <UNK> of the <UNK> and its damned driver even today the end result is highly effective a particularly impressive scene involves the phantom <UNK> travelling to the ocean floor to retrieve the soul of a drowned man another scene <UNK> reminiscent of jack <UNK> jack nicholson in stanley kubrick's 'the shining ' involves <UNK> breaking down the kitchen door with an axe in order to reach his fleeing wife and children br br genuinely ominous and unsettling in its execution victor is a fine work of cinema successfully portraying <UNK> steady alcoholic decline his inevitable day of judgment and a final hopeful possibility of redemption
<START> bob <UNK> is excellent in this as this technically brilliant hitchcock film really does not get the fame as some of his other films but is very watchable even today <UNK> lane proves in this one that she can hold her own with other <UNK> that worked with hitchcock later she just did a handful of films after this which makes her almost forgotten today br br there are sequences in this that will remind the viewer of set ups in later films by the director the acting is so well done and the story so well done that this film is still very entertaining today every person in the cast performs well there are several great backdrops in the black white film br br this was the first film at universal for hitchcock long run between the feature films he did at universal plus the television series hitchcock would make as much box office for the studios as anyone who worked there this fact gets lost in film history br br norman lloyd is well cast as the real bad guy in this film the story moves along really well including hitchcock's only filmed western sequence this film is very good with lots of great work by everyone involved making it
<START> so i'm wondering while watching this film did the producers of this movie get to save money on sandra <UNK> wardrobe by dragging out her before clothes from miss <UNK> did ms <UNK> also get to <UNK> through the role by <UNK> the before <UNK> hart as many reviewers have noted before the film is very formulaic add to that the <UNK> <UNK> viewer experiences with the character of cassie <UNK> as a somewhat darker <UNK> hart with more back story and it rapidly become a <UNK> fest br br the two bad boy serial killers have been done before and better in other films as has the good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence character been seen before in fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two <UNK> or try to be anything but trite stereotypes br br one last <UNK> using the term serial killer is false advertising murdering one person even if it's a <UNK> murder does not make you a serial killer you may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer
<START> this movie is complex and interesting in so many ways it is a non stop <UNK> of emotion and taboo subjects sex and love women's emotional abuse of men men's physical abuse of women sexual child abuse fresh approach to religion in real life and all tied together with very raw and powerful blues music br br i promise you that if you sit through the first 20 minutes you will find the tie in and <UNK> of all the characters and the ending will be more pleasant than you can expect music is outstanding the writing is powerful and acting from everyone was brilliant br br and the dvd has some great features including samuel jackson's background of learning to play guitar and feel the blues br br this movie is not for children and i even caution parents of teenagers
<START> if only i had read the review by alex <UNK> <UNK> on here rather than looking at the rating of over 6 from a <UNK> choice of the ignorant viewing public i would not have seen this <UNK> alien was a fantastic dramatic and well made horror sci fi predator was a great sci fi action mess about i do really have only myself to blame though as i saw versus it too has an average <UNK> of over 6 stars from the <UNK> of film that frequent this site br br stop reading now if you have any fear of this ever so suspense ridden plot being ruined for you br br right from the beginning this film was ridiculous no explanation was offered for the predator ship <UNK> not <UNK> by aliens ok so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an alien predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology the start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why from then on it gets really ridiculous i always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out i couldn't here br br a father and son are hunting in the woods the damaged ship crash lands to from the view given i would <UNK> at the very least 10 odd miles away through thick <UNK> the man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face <UNK> even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face <UNK> are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible dumb redneck muppet br br an edgy thriller type scenario is introduced with an ex con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat <UNK> dull now cop friend from the bus when i say introduced i mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out a slasher horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow <UNK> cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective crazy nasty jock type american <UNK> not a scottish man oh the cute not cute boy is the ex brother by the way yes they're clever these director brothers whose name i will research in order to avoid any other <UNK> they put out again then a modern role <UNK> oh so boring attempt at pc <UNK> <UNK> type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child br br guess what happens next i won't tell you much more about the actual smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films plot just in case you have got this far and are not the <UNK> star in the alien ridden universe br br the predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post i read too late the aliens are boring the predator alien is ridiculous the action is at times exploitative gratuitous disgusting nonsense the hospital scene with the pregnant mothers oh i was shocked alright shocked at how low some people will go to get what a scare some shock to <UNK> the perverse what if you really wanted to shock <UNK> and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the alien predator <UNK> the <UNK> women and teenage girls rather than killing them the characters have no depth and neither does the plot it's filmed and paced badly it's acted by <UNK> people not that i can blame them it further <UNK> two rather interesting and good sets of sci fi characters this film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it i really have to worry about you if you haven't seen it then well please make your own decision br br ps did i even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about 20 seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout
<START> i had read the newspaper reviews of this film and i must say my expectations were very low before watching <UNK> 12 i really enjoyed the first movie but this <UNK> is one of the worst movies ever i would rate it top 5 of the worst movie i have ever seen why do i say that first of all there is a story so thin that britney spears <UNK> looks like the perfect action thriller the <UNK> that could be assigned the term story is loosely held together at times but most of the time the movie just moves along with no purpose or drive the entire story seems forced and the script surrounding the story is even more forced that it become farce at times br br the actors show up but doesn't do anything to deserve any credit or <UNK> most embarrassing are leading ladies roberts and zeta jones that either <UNK> or are extremely plain damon clooney and pitt aren't brilliant either to be honest i really don't understand how they would want to be associated with something as bad as this movie br br may contains spoilers camera and editing sigh where should i begin there are many unnecessary camera movements that just make the experience painful combine that with extremely editing and you start looking for a wooden <UNK> to <UNK> your heart out especially the scene where the entire gang is moved out of the prison to be transported away by car the camera zoom to each person just get boring and when you are at number 3 of 12 you got the message wow you are cool and can do simple zoom effects not i understand that the scene with tess ocean julia roberts playing julia roberts is supposed to be funny but it just gets extremely embarrassing and you turn away to avoid experiencing the mess bruce willis why please explain it to me why br br to <UNK> if you have to choose between root <UNK> work and watching <UNK> 12 i recommend the former make sure they do all the teeth while you are at it
<START> harmony i'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded br br i know that there were big questions raised in this movie like who are we really what are we here for is there really a god all great questions but i really don't think that is funny when you have the questions along side such tragedy i'm all for real life being portrayed but come on it's never funny when a wife is being raped someone killing themselves and family and friends find the body and people die for unexplained and unnecessary reasons br br the only good thing about this movie was the location it was filmed there is a lot of beautiful places br br i'm not a film student or even know all that much on the subject i admit this but i do know that when i leave the theater with a feeling of disgust then it was not a film i would recommend to anyone
<START> rented free rental thank goodness this as supposedly filmed in <UNK> where i live could have been filmed in a tunnel for all that matter dark ninety percent of time and just an awful attempt at a low budget flick which can be good if done right in a nutshell about a bunch of young adults who witness meteor fall and subsequently fall prey to aliens on a <UNK> island <UNK> by keeper and wife analysis br br acting dreadful br br writing uninspired br br story done a million times before with different settings br br production values okay lighting for budget br br effects creature digital other horrible very cheap looking br br so you get the <UNK> of it to add insult to injury end credits has <UNK> of filming really now who cares distributed under a universal company shocked they would even do so after viewing br br finally as alternative try creep low budget but well written well acted and fairly well creepy
<START> hello it is i <UNK> cannon and i welcome you to the first ever review show my movie for this week was <UNK> what route what movie what excellent four star epic would i choose guess what i decided to pull a one <UNK> and go the other route i've decided to review a movie so atrocious that it totally killed what could have been a very unique concept the movie i will review today is jack frost two revenge of the mutant killer snowman the stars in this movie include christopher <UNK> as sam <UNK> <UNK> as anne <UNK> clark as <UNK> david allen brooks as agent manners sean patrick murphy as captain fun ray <UNK> as the colonel and scott macdonald as the killer snowman himself jack frost br br it's hard to believe that this movie was in the same series that gave us the incredibly funny jack frost loved the <UNK> scene but it's even harder to believe that this is the exact same cast the movie was ruined for me as soon as they arrived on the island and captain fun was introduced what was the point of his character and how did he fit into a horror movie the only possible reason i could see was that they wanted to give us a character that was total killer snowman fodder sam seemed more paranoid then he did in the original his <UNK> about anti freeze was one of the most pathetic display i had seen in a movie his wife however was one of the few bright spots she played her role as the main woman to a <UNK> she was a voice of reason in film of pure idiocy the scene where she figures out how to kill the <UNK> was one of the most anticipated parts of the movie ray macdonald once again did a great job as jack frost despite what he was given if it wasn't for such weak characters he could have been <UNK> like <UNK> freddy and jason laugh if you must but when it comes down to it jack frost had <UNK> he had humor and most importantly he had an vicious streak br br this movie could have been so much more it could have been a <UNK> of a great franchise instead any plans to make a jack frost three have been canceled br br this movie gets a two out of ten for me and it's lucky that it even gets a one
<START> like other movies from the worst director ever ed wood this movie is very bad but because of that it is also very funny may be not for everyone but i laughed a lot it is a strange thing when you enjoy a bad movie how do you rate it as a movie very low as entertainment at least a little higher br br the movie tries to explain what a <UNK> is and it does this through a scientist bela lugosi and an inspector <UNK> <UNK> who talks to a doctor timothy farrell who knows about these things the doctor tells the detective two stories and that is what we and apparently the scientist see the doctor <UNK> these stories because a dead <UNK> is found suicide and because of a <UNK> in the news paper about a sex change the first and longest story is about <UNK> ed wood himself who is in love and about to marry barbara <UNK> fuller but he has never told her he like to dress as a woman when he is named glenda the movie tells the same thing over and over again especially the fact that a <UNK> is not necessarily a homosexual the movie almost says that being a <UNK> is not a bad thing but being homosexual is since it keeps telling us the fact that a <UNK> is not a homosexual the second story is about a <UNK> who really wants a sex change and not just wants to dress up as a woman but it is much shorter and less interesting br br a couple of things make this movie very bad and therefore laughable how the story is presented is the first thing the way the same things are told over and over again and the conclusion of it all are others this is not where it ends the acting is very bad especially <UNK> fuller seems to be reading her lines directly from a little screen somewhere every thing she says is funny the whole dialogue actually gave me quite some laughs br br there is also a sequence where someone walks into a room the door stays half open and we see something hanging on the wall not completely straight then the door in what seems to be the same shot although we know it is not is a little less open and suddenly the thing on the wall hangs straight ed wood didn't mind to leave this kind of continuity errors in his movie may be a good thing because basically it is just another laugh for the modern audience i think you understand that it is a bad movie and i think there is a good chance you will laugh at the ridiculous mistakes as well
<START> this is the worst film i have ever seen bar none from the flimsy looking poorly lit sets to the laughable acting to the <UNK> plot and shoddy drawn out action sequences this film is so bad its hilarious for about ten minutes after which you will be reaching for the remote or the power <UNK> to end this film non experience although it was obviously made with the entire production and acting collective tongue <UNK> in cheek please god i found jack frost 2 so dreadful as to be unwatchable for more than a quarter of an hour if you have not had enough of it after this time you must be <UNK> in drug abuse
<START> <UNK> the audience wherever it was shown it gathered audience awards on many film festivals all over the world and it is not strange we have the ability to watch a cheerful and an astonishing piece of art and it is wise by the way is a very funny comedy about youth and growing up but most of all it is about the lights and shadows of living in the european union br br the main character of the film is a french student of economy <UNK> for his future <UNK> his is sent for one year of studying to <UNK> in spain it turns out that the <UNK> are being given in <UNK> language that probably doesn't help the of knowledge but it helps in <UNK> the relationships inside the group of foreign exchange students especially if they rent a big flat together there are 3 girls english <UNK> and spanish as well as three boys german danish and italian our french guy will also get there a year is a very long time long enough to get close and make friends and get to know some european stereotypes while trying to break them apart br br treats this special case of a process of <UNK> europe with humor and without he comes out of the idea that young people are everywhere just the same they like jokes they like to make irresponsible relationships but they don't neglect their aspirations the most interesting is the sum of experience of this little community they live together in the fire of everyday tasks fighting with the surrounding reality they are full of unusual ideas for life young europeans come back to their countries to take up a life of an adult on their own they are <UNK> hope to fight the many problems of the union for example the terrifying administration system in the end they proof that not only can they communicate and make friends despite the many differences but they also now how to live the full of life and they won't allow taking that full of life away from them
<START> i am a fifth grade language arts teacher and after we read this book which the students loved then we watched the movie they laughed out loud unfortunately it's not a comedy the acting was so awful i felt like i was watching a bunch of kids in the neighborhood putting on a play my students were <UNK> the lines and making fun off and on the whole way through i have to agree with them at times it was pretty bad still i would show it to students again just for fun and to compare the film with the book we did a <UNK> <UNK> teachers know what that is afterward to show what was the same in both and what were the differences so there is an educational value in showing it i noticed that another adaptation is being filmed for 2005 so we can only hope the acting will be better
<START> just got back from the european premiere of the <UNK> <UNK> rising br br all i can say is that if you are a <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> then this movie is for you and if you're not a <UNK> well it's still a great deal of fun br br the acting is certainly not oscar worthy but in the whole element of the movie it adds to the charm the humour is everywhere along with some very nice touches the tribute to gary is especially well done if you can spot it the cast are very down to earth in their appearance <UNK> the fact that they are ordinary people enjoying an ordinary <UNK> br br the quality of the movie's sound and vision are adequate but again it all just adds to the atmosphere that helps to define this movie as being the <UNK> and dragons movie written and performed by <UNK> for <UNK> br br not afraid to use <UNK> specific to one system they still manage to allow product placement to be a part of the movie but in a very understandable and utterly fair manner it also touches on some of the perceived prejudices that some <UNK> can have about other <UNK> and deals with that quite well br br all in all the movie is very much driven by an well thought out equal balance of character plot and entertainment the <UNK> is amazingly good value for money br br in the end it does make <UNK> this movie quite hard so i have given it 2 scores br br score for non 7 10 a few moments could go way over your head but the main sections of the movie just work so hard and achieve so much more br br score for 10 10 everything fits together in the perfect <UNK> and with the perfect charm and sentiment
<START> i saw a screening of this movie last night i had high expectations going into it but was definitely disappointed within 5 minutes of the opening williams is already <UNK> for his <UNK> and he becomes president in the first 40 minutes so there goes all that aspect of the movie the first half hour are hilarious don't get me wrong the movie has its moments but after the first half hour it takes a turn for the worst it becomes less of a comedy and more of a thriller drama love story which is pointless the movie goes nowhere and stands still for a good 30 minutes there are laughs interspersed here and there but the consistently funny part is in the beginning and only the beginning at one point the biggest cheer i heard in the audience is when a person in the crowd <UNK> during a very <UNK> emotional scene williams gives a great performance right on par with his comedic style walken also delivers a strong supporting role as only he can i think the one character that goes underrated is lewis black consistently vulgar and political its funny to see him tone it down for a pg 13 rating overall i would not pay to see the movie <UNK> i saw it for free and even i was disappointed the first half hour is solid and its all downhill from there not really fitting into a category the movie realizes half way through that it should not have been anything more than a one hour comedy central special 4 5 10
<START> bare <UNK> is another <UNK> parody of the blair witch project i think there's about two dozen of those things out there it has 5 very attractive women which includes <UNK> fritz julie smith and julie strain and one <UNK> guy whose only purpose is to provide comic relief br br okay so i'm thinking cool great looking women having <UNK> lesbian sex with each other very 10 minutes or so this should be real good br br unfortunately the producers blew it there is nothing in this video that actually qualifies as a sex scene there's a couple of false starts but the majority of the action is just the women posing for the camera i guess once the producers had spent their money on the women and spent more getting them to remove their clothes they didn't have any money left to get them to actually do anything and i guess they also used up all their <UNK> nudity time too early because towards the end of the video there is a huge amount of pointless dialogue that is obviously being used for no other reason than to pad out the run time you're a liar no you are you go into the cave no you go i think we should go home well i don't this goes on and on and on forever br br there's way better stuff than this
<START> the one liners fly so fast in this movie that you can watch it over and over and still catch new ones by far one of the best of this genre
<START> after mrs and mr <UNK> this is yet another very good film by <UNK> mostly in english in the earlier film she treated a contemporary political environment and its effect on individuals in this film it is the impact of mentally disabled member of the family and its impact on the family as a parallel sub theme she treats a philosophical concept on reality it is a film which leads to thinking after seeing the film br br the younger sister <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the daughter of <UNK> is suffering from <UNK> being taken care of by the <UNK> elder sister <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> after her marriage with <UNK> and <UNK> from him believes that she is still with <UNK> and her five children in 15 park <UNK> in there is no such address in it seems there is one in new york and she is intense in her belief it is almost like an intense religious belief ultimately what is reality in one scene she tells <UNK> if i tell you that you are not a professor but only imagine that you are a professor the open ending reflects this reality in a supposedly search for her home in park <UNK> is lost the <UNK> scene is looking at a group of five children playing and her looking at them with joy of returning to her family and then she is lost about this concept of reality i am reminded of another film of fifties called harry with james stewart the protagonist believes that a big sized rabbit called harry is always with him and he is always <UNK> with him at the end even the doctor believes perhaps there is harry what is reality is it what the protagonist believes or what other believe <UNK> <UNK> the film with her sterling performance as the strong elder sister with <UNK> of frustration <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gives equally <UNK> performance as the <UNK> br br yet the film is not as tight as mrs and mr <UNK> there appear to be some loose ends and perhaps there are too many characters those who want a closed ending may not appreciate the open ending here but the ending <UNK> the theme of the film br br yet another good film by <UNK>
<START> it is not surprising that this film was made by i'm <UNK> at the time it was he examined the early beauty and tragedy of <UNK> life in and delightfully explored a well known korean folk tale in and these comprised his last two films what is most surprising is that <UNK> <UNK> his 2002 offering is not presented in the style of those previous two films br br nonetheless the experienced hand of i'm comes through we explore together the life of a real person a late <UNK> century <UNK> painter who rides on the edge of <UNK> but who is not a noble and who because of that causes a stir in contemporary korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old korean noble class and his contempt for would be japanese <UNK> <UNK> alike the painter chang <UNK> up known <UNK> as oh won performed <UNK> by <UNK> min the famous star of park chan already legendary <UNK> becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film contemporary korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact or maybe because of the fact that he was so <UNK> in his time sense of <UNK> beauty and tragedy in history remains intact i'm is a master at capturing his country's past <UNK> and in this film he almost <UNK> himself as expected in an i'm film the cinematography is breathtaking the editing is precise and the story is central br br plots are set against <UNK> up family ties are tested and broken <UNK> behavior is alleged and is sometimes real all to bring down the man who painted fire but against all the <UNK> of detailed but sometimes convoluted account of <UNK> <UNK> life <UNK> up himself somehow manages to survive he becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous chinese paintings after only one look art dealers and agents then <UNK> him and try to make money off oh won in other words lines of people who wish to take advantage of the real <UNK> up an artistic star begin to form but he refuses to be manipulated his <UNK> in off both the massive <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the audience if not the cast br br what does <UNK> up think he possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished he <UNK> those who would try to turn art into profit and he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as <UNK> but he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming <UNK> horrid scenes involving foreign <UNK> from france and japan are presented signature historical epic <UNK> and his influence in the realm remains on prominent display in this multi million dollar epic br br the protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint this is when the story takes on a whole new meaning one that is not just political but social in nature i'm takes on the issues in <UNK> <UNK> fashion br br he oh won becomes a jesus figure the people believe him capable of artistic <UNK> and the government feels it needs his artistic support but the protagonist remains <UNK> independent and <UNK> of what others want him to do or be eventually both government and people come down upon <UNK> up in a manner taken straight out of the bible his <UNK> becomes human his humanity is not accepted he dies for or escapes from the sins of the <UNK> the art critics the politicians who <UNK> him br br but does he die as with most of films a question remains in this case does <UNK> up really become an immortal <UNK> the film does not tackle that question it merely presents a possible end for the real man of chang <UNK> up or oh won no death is depicted because no death is known br br it is difficult to find fault with this film but i'm has become so good at presenting various historical <UNK> in his culture that when he does it hardly surprises anymore as usual for films the cinematography the editing and the writing are all first rate it's a well crafted film <UNK> with uncanny story telling ability granted he may be best at doing this through the ancient korean musical art of still the film contains stretches of this admirable art form and by the end viewers feel as if they have become <UNK> to a great <UNK> story and they have because that precisely is gift
<START> okay now this movie is a piece of work it's full of stupid jesus and that would render most human to question whether or not they should be movies at all big names like <UNK> <UNK> and david carradine draw you in but take it from me this movie sucks the story is incomprehensible and lacking <UNK> in <UNK> the sets and costumes come of as a cross five and a bondage flick i'm sure <UNK> porn with better
<START> this was a very funny fast paced movie i watched it more than once and am keeping my rental around to show others i'd just like to take this opportunity to ask anyone in the know how do hk producers choose their <UNK> <UNK> i'm most curious please direct me br br again to return to review it is a really <UNK> film with plenty of content subtleties reminiscent of the classics though full of slapstick reminiscent say of the mexican comedies of <UNK> br br the film does not disappoint fans of the director who have noticed that he chooses distinctly chinese themes trying to get to characteristics rarely explored the director's entire collection is way of getting a look inside the culture in a <UNK> way br br and i don't see how his funny girl in chinese feast could be topped
<START> like many others i counted on the appearance of dennis hopper to make this not a complete waste of time i was sadly mistaken everything negative said about this <UNK> is more than true what takes the cake however is the horrible horrible storyline for the main character br br here's why the planet might be destroyed the only way to recover from it for the entire human race to be saved <UNK> it is to get as many smart capable nice competent people into an underground hide out and dennis hopper is the lone <UNK> scientist with vision who was prepared for the worst and who has realized this but what's the main motivation of stevens sonny <UNK> he's angry because dennis has decided who is to be saved or to be doomed while it clearly explained to stevens that <UNK> character has done everything to warn people of the danger but that he was laughed at the hopper character was the boy with the finger in the <UNK> and now stevens is <UNK> him for and and if that isn't enough he wants to stop everybody from entering this <UNK> because it isn't fair and he's responsible for the death of the one guy who is <UNK> <UNK> oh my god how stupid can you get br br what's also <UNK> that imdb forces one to write minimal ten lines about this piece of crap i mean two million in budget what could have been done with that think <UNK> blair witch and <UNK> other movies who have been made for under 100 000 dollars and were still better i count myself lucky that i didn't pay one penny to see this crap and to sit through the end of this utter crap is one the most heroic things i've done this year it's no wonder that the writers of this pile of dung had jobs as camera <UNK> and title designer before
<START> i knew it was going to be awful but not this awful as it's one of the most boring movies i have ever seen not a damn thing happens all the characters are dull and the story is stupid and incredibly boring plus the ending is especially lame the only reason i rented this piece of crap because i am a big fan of michael <UNK> however he is wasted here and looks extremely bored and shows no emotion what so ever plus i <UNK> out loud when the movie was over it's like the movie had no plot and it was all about nothing and ice t is god awful even though he is ok in some stuff plus <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> had no chemistry together at all there's one scene that the director tried to make emotional but he fails miserably as <UNK> <UNK> didn't really show all that much emotion however there is a decent car chase scene but that's not enough for me to recommend this god awful film plus the dialog is atrocious avoid this movie like the plague not a damn thing happens please avoid and trust me on this one you may thank me <UNK> the direction is horrible fred <UNK> ray does a horrible job here with shoddy camera work laughably cheap looking set pieces terrible angles laughable use of stock footage and keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace the acting is terrible michael <UNK> is nowhere near his usual amazing self he looks extremely bored and shows no emotion what so ever his character is also extremely dull as i can't believe he signed on for this piece of garbage he also had no chemistry with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> still rules ice t has barely anything to do and also looks bored and he didn't convince me one bit is not very good here he had somewhat of a <UNK> character i didn't like him <UNK> <UNK> is pretty but was really terrible here she didn't show much emotion and had no chemistry with <UNK> and as a result i didn't give a damn about her character art owen <UNK> kathy <UNK> <UNK> and the rest of the cast are bad as well overall please avoid like the plague fred <UNK> ray and steve should be ashamed of themselves bomb out of 5
<START> i can only agree with many <UNK> that is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television i saw when it was on tv and i have just watched it again i am particularly moved by the haunting original music of tim and especially by the <UNK> <UNK> of chamber <UNK> in c minor the music over the credits and in parts of the film the music <UNK> the desperation of the characters as they pursue their sad fate the music is <UNK> emotional this <UNK> combines two of the movements from the <UNK> but i recommend listening to the <UNK> per se
<START> i have just seen this broadcast on channel 4 having seen some of the earlier comments here i think i would like to state firstly that i am not in favour of the death penalty with that out of the way i was expecting great things of this film but it just didn't quite deliver dead man walking is very <UNK> done with good performances all round and a good script in fact it's hard to fault it artistically however i felt that although it attempted to confront the issues surrounding capital punishment it seemed to become <UNK> by the religious moral stance hardly surprising given that the main character is a nun although i'm not a heartless individual i didn't really <UNK> with any of the characters in the story if you don't take religion seriously then you probably won't see much in this film i think that peter <UNK> let him have it was a much more powerful and moving film and i would strongly recommend anyone considering watching this to go and see that
<START> bounty killer george hilton smooth mexican <UNK> gilbert <UNK> who's great and bank representative <UNK> <UNK> each try to <UNK> one another while searching for a large amount of gold from one of train <UNK> that was hidden by a <UNK> member of his gang br br though not the greatest that the genre has to offer it's still <UNK> enough with a lot of light hearted action filled fun and a satisfying finale br br any gun can play is mainly remembered for it's opening gag where george hilton easily guns down three <UNK> resembling clint eastwood lee van <UNK> and <UNK> br br the next year hilton and <UNK> were reunited alongside van <UNK> and <UNK> kinski in the highly recommended the ruthless four
<START> i was fairly lost throughout most of this film and i am the one who usually understands the works of such enigmatic cinema <UNK> as david lynch twin peaks fire walk with me and darren <UNK> <UNK> not to say that <UNK> doesn't make sense on some level it just doesn't combine to form a wholly coherent film as time passes from watching the film its themes and intentions become <UNK> but during my initial viewing i was really <UNK> and i find that this is the major fault of the film its lack of direction the plot centers on the town of <UNK> montana in the year 1955 the town has been <UNK> and will soon be <UNK> to make way for the creation of a <UNK> electric <UNK> the major problem is that not all of its inhabitants are willing to be <UNK> and <UNK> a group of men are hired to <UNK> the remaining residents out of the town before it will be drowned and for the most part they succeed amidst some fairly odd situations and <UNK> simultaneously the film tells the story of irwin a very sick young boy or is he a fallen angel whose adopted parents gave him back due to his illness to the <UNK> <UNK> that they adopted him from father <UNK> nick nolte cares for the dying irwin but irwin <UNK> or does he that a group of angels including <UNK> hannah and anthony <UNK> have arrived in the desolate and empty town looking for a fallen angel irwin has <UNK> on his back and on his head and he tries to convince the angels that his <UNK> are where the humans <UNK> his wings and <UNK> oh yeah and during all of this there is a strangely surreal walking animal on <UNK> that <UNK> throughout the backdrop of the landscape there are a lot of other small events that happen in the film but none of them end up <UNK> to much more than <UNK> intrigue one can appreciate the artistic quality of the film it's obvious that the filmmakers cared deeply about this film and its rich cinematography but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and <UNK> to an end without making much of a statement like i wrote earlier it becomes <UNK> long after viewing what has possibly taken place in the film irwin is dying and so is <UNK> and in <UNK> with his own loss and death irwin has most likely created characters from ideas he gets from the objects that surround him at the <UNK> to <UNK> him as he is abandoned and his life <UNK> its end but then again maybe he really is an angel and he has found his kind and can now return home i must emphasize that there are some truly beautiful moments in the film heartbreaking vivid and full of loneliness and sadness unfortunately the film as a whole just ends up feeling <UNK> and somehow <UNK>
<START> easily one of my three or four favorite films definitely one for the desert island there is nothing about this film rather it <UNK> warm and <UNK> the audience is invited to a party and like any good party the joy comes in the interaction of the guests and what you learn as you progress from one to the next with apologies to <UNK> the film's title <UNK> up a number of ideas that keep audiences away the film is not horrifying it is not depressing it is a beautiful look into a time that has past within which people are growing up and others are <UNK> down some are frustrated and others are <UNK> and all around ever present throughout the evening are the people and the parts of people that have been laid to rest the words these exquisite actors are given to speak are perfection and set to the music of the irish <UNK> are an <UNK> feast particularly to us flat toned americans about the lack of brilliance i referred to above i take it back there is no other word to describe the final scene between <UNK> huston and <UNK> <UNK> it speaks quiet volumes about ¬Ö well everything some lovely snowy evening rent this film and just let it happen before you no <UNK> no car chases no dinosaurs ¬ñ just film at its most sublime
<START> of course all this nonsense begs the question <UNK> a genre as self <UNK> as the teen comedy really need another parody movie ' the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i and ii took the formula about as far as it could go <UNK> another teen <UNK> really doesn't have anything either intelligent or shockingly excessive to add br br the plot essentially based on <UNK> all <UNK> walks a shaky line between parody and homage <UNK> hughes high <UNK> everything from <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> is <UNK> for references the result is ultimately an <UNK> viewer experience the downside of giving us a <UNK> copy plot of <UNK> all <UNK> is that we all know where its going anyway and if we didn't then the jokes would be meaningless br br there's extremely little to recommend here the token gross out scene an <UNK> toilet seems badly out of place here amongst all the <UNK> <UNK> references there are moments of humour the song is funny enough and the odd good line is send the audiences way it stinks don't watch it
<START> barney is about imagination what you guys do not have if my never wanted to play pretend like they do in that show then i would be worried what 2 or 3 year old actually gets all that anyways its all about the colors and the singing for those of you saying that all they do on barney is eat junk food and recommend <UNK> street better well what about cookie monster thats all he eats but i haven't seen anyone comment that one i do agree that <UNK> is a better educational show but barney is just like a show for fun don't be too serious if you didn't like your child watching tv and worried about them understanding things you don't believe then you shouldn't be <UNK> them down in front of the tv in the first place because all of that is fake everything is fake actors are fake so why don't you take your fake brains and put it to use and think if you have a problem with a fake television show for kids then turn it off and play with them yourselves and teach them what you want them to learn not big bird or bert ernie or barney someone who used to watch all those shows and turned out fine
<START> this movie was recommended to me by several people and after reading all the positive comments from this site i went ahead and bought a copy of the film off ebay the acting in the film is average and a bit hammy especially by the family of cannibals one sequence comes to mind when <UNK> is <UNK> and raving to the burnt corpse speaking right into the camera its one of those performances where you just cringe and feel bad for that poor actor its also evidence of some of the worst editing i've seen <UNK> a terrible jump cut right in the middle of his speech there are a few creepy moments though and at times the music works well but overall the film <UNK> that great and i dont know why people think wes craven is that great of a director thus far he hasn't showed me anything that i believe to be brilliant the only thing that improved with <UNK> films production to was his budget
<START> an interesting look at the immigrant experience told as a fable with some very weird imagery br br i got drawn to this movie because it tells of immigrants from <UNK> who traveled to america i imagine much the same as my grandfather did at that time travelling in <UNK> to provide <UNK> for the ships i cannot imagine it was very comfortable as shown in this film br br laws <UNK> immigrants existed i would guess that these laws were more strict on those who came from the <UNK> and africa immigrants had to be free from <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> in the film we see physical and mental <UNK> the latter because of the view that low intelligence is single women could not enter the country on the <UNK> that they would become prostitutes so most married single men already in the country as arranged beforehand at <UNK> island before entry br br this is the story of a british immigrant charlotte <UNK> who <UNK> to marry a poor <UNK> vincenzo <UNK> he is trying to get his family through with a son that is mute and a mother <UNK> that is considered feeble minded she was fantastic in the role by the way br br you will also see character actor vincent <UNK> in his next to the last appearance i don't know if his last film has been released he plays a <UNK> and is also very good br br it was a strange but enjoyable film it's not for everyone as i imagine those who don't have some interest in the immigrant experience would find it rather slow
<START> spoiler alert disjointed and confusing <UNK> drama that has to do with a sinister plan to burn down a major vacation resort before new years day being <UNK> for ten million dollars the man behind valley view <UNK> in the blue mountains in australia julian guy is determined to bring his own project down in flames in order to collect this has to happen by january 1 two weeks hence before the insurance policy on the project runs out br br with his mind totally on his work <UNK> and architect howard anderson tom <UNK> has no idea that his boss julian is planning to burn down the resort he's building and possibly set him up as the fall guy anderson gets a bit suspicious when insurance investigator sophie <UNK> wendy hughes informs him on some very <UNK> goings on between and the insurance company proud alliance it turns out that proud is actually owned or 60 of it by himself this explains <UNK> is having all these <UNK> fires happen in order to collect the ten million dollars of insurance which is at least twice as much as the entire valley view <UNK> is worth br br we later have sophie <UNK> murdered in a <UNK> swimming accident to keep her from finding out whats happening with the suspicious <UNK> around and in valley view <UNK> it's when <UNK> of london who's proud alliance insurance investigator george james mason shows up that takes a <UNK> leaving his ace <UNK> on his own and out of control to blow entire plan br br meanwhile anderson has gotten wise to both and who unlike wants the valley view <UNK> to go under for reasons which are never made quite clear just watch the last few seconds of the film to realize that by it's writer and director the <UNK> is exposed as he's about to do in his girlfriend with anderson coming to her rescue we then have this wild chase scene with the <UNK> getting lost in the valley view construction site only to have it set on fire with the help of howard anderson where he ends up burning to a <UNK> by the time the fire department came to <UNK> him down br br the sudden and unexplained ending never made clear to just what happened to the big cheese in this whole scheme of things the sinister and evil minded julian it's as if got away <UNK> free and only his unstable and deranged henchman the <UNK> who was only the <UNK> of crimes ended up as the only person who <UNK> from them
<START> well i'm an italian horror big fan and i love movies from directors such <UNK> fulci <UNK> sr and <UNK> jr only to quote the most famous la villa <UNK> anime is one of the most unknown movie of this genre shot when this kind of cinema began its crisis that continues still today and director <UNK> sounds totally new to my ears he directed six movies this is the price italian directors have to pay to not work in rome but the film is not so bad and it's absolutely not correct to talk about trash ok the plot is not so original it reminds me stuff like the series the year is the same of <UNK> possession by <UNK> <UNK> or shock the last work of mario <UNK> but you have to think that this is the movie of a cinematographer like mario <UNK> movies so the most important thing is the atmosphere not the story or the characters atmosphere very well created by the use of light and by the camera movement the rest remain in the background i think the movie works not so good but works it's surely better than a lot of <UNK> production like the haunting which have a bigger budget but not bigger ideas
<START> this is one of a very few movies with terrific acting wonderful story line and worthwhile to watch it is about changes in life it is about how happiness can be found when one is true to <UNK> it is about accepting <UNK> and others it is about life challenges it is about coming to term with reality it is about courage it is about love both actresses are very true to their role the actresses had very good chemistry between one another in the movie this is the key of the movie that made the movie it is rare to see an independent film like this one one could tell the hard work that the film crew had to have while producing this movie i wish to see more movie from this producer writer see the movie you will love it
<START> if you have never heard of jane austen seen the original movie or the 1995 bbc adaptation or even seen a pop up version of the book then this <UNK> attempt to show this classic love story may be considered vaguely <UNK> br br from the opening scene this film must be remembered for its awful acting <UNK> <UNK> and complete lack of the classic wit of jane austen br br whoever decided to cast actors with the exception of the excellent <UNK> <UNK> who have obviously never heard of jane austen let alone read her should be <UNK> <UNK> knightley <UNK> and <UNK> through every scene and came across as being so obnoxious that no one would want to marry her <UNK> looked as if he was trying to remember his lines throughout the whole film and the rest of the <UNK> girls were <UNK> in their lack of portraying their characters as they were originally written br br this version failed to show the proper pride and prejudice that both <UNK> and elizabeth suffered from and at the end of the longest two hours of my life who cared whether they got together or not absolutely abysmal even the too few minutes of <UNK> <UNK> cannot save this rubbish i cannot think of anything good to say about this film apart from that it eventually ended
<START> this might very well be the worst movie i've seen in my life normally i don't watch movies like this however i was forced to watch this at school what a torment br br the story is as average and boring as it can be boy meets girl at the spanish coast boy and girl fall in love but the love between the two seems impossible and everyone and everything is against their love at the end of the movie the film becomes some kind of weird kung fu movie were the guys in white fight the guys in black awful br br the action is so bad that it makes you laugh the dances in the film that i think are supposed to be cool are so simple and laughable that even i can do them and <UNK> <UNK> is possibly the most irritating person i've ever seen on screen br br <UNK> is on his way of becoming the dutch ed wood his movies are so bad that they make you laugh br br victor however gives a surprising good performance and also acts ok br br so please for your own sake don't watch this movie however if you like watching <UNK> this might be very well worth your time br br <UNK> br br 2 10
<START> i was given the solo <UNK> in <UNK> grade for our spring <UNK> concert from that time on a great appreciation for <UNK> music <UNK> in me i love the haunting <UNK> of this opera by gershwin back when i was in <UNK> grade around age 10 i got the <UNK> to practice with and also love the soundtrack very much i recommend seeing this movie and if you can get the soundtrack get it you can sometimes find it on ebay an old used <UNK> i have been searching and searching to try to find the soundtrack on cd the songs on this have marvelous musical <UNK> and i truly wish it would be put on cd for purchase and also wish they would <UNK> the movie and put it on dvd this is truly a great work that i think present and future generations would enjoy and benefit from some may think the movie slow and dull but i find it quite the contrary although <UNK> and <UNK> have dubbed musical voices i think the voices fit the faces and personalities well a person's speaking voice and singing voice may be quite different and <UNK> and the songs in this opera will always have a special meaning for me
<START> okay when it comes to plots this film is far from believable and also a bit silly yet despite its many <UNK> the film manages to work provided you turn off your brain and just let yourself enjoy the <UNK> of it all if you can't then you probably won't like this film very much at all br br in one of the <UNK> plots of the 1930s robert <UNK> plays a guy living near the <UNK> circle at a <UNK> station how exactly he came to such a remote <UNK> is uncertain but into this very very lonely and isolated existence come a steady string of guests even though it had been years since he'd seen anyone but <UNK> br br first <UNK> owen and myrna loy arrive when their plane crashes they are supposedly on their way to <UNK> how they got that far off course is beyond belief <UNK> is a <UNK> and dull fellow who is really worried about <UNK> since robert hasn't seen a woman in a very long time and owen seems in constant dread that <UNK> is out to steal loy for himself as for <UNK> that's exactly what his plans are for the longest time you never really understand why loy is engaged to owen since he is about as appealing as <UNK> bread br br soon loy and <UNK> fall in love but this is all for <UNK> when out of the blue again <UNK> old fianc√©e arrives to <UNK> she's there to marry him considering that for over two years she never wrote and refused to follow him <UNK> naturally assumed the relationship was over but the <UNK> and annoying <UNK> sudden arrival is enough to destroy the plans loy and <UNK> were making br br how all this is resolved is something you can just see for yourself as for the film that the plot is very silly and contrived i can't defend this but it also is pretty funny and charming and i see this film as a <UNK> comedy that is just a step or two below contemporary films like bringing up baby silly slight but also very charming it's worth seeing despite not being especially believable
<START> this was an awesome movie with flight scenes that were incredibly realistic i have seen it multiple times and it has kept my attention throughout every time i myself am a big fan of the air force and love to watch any movie where i can get a glimpse of an f 16 flying if you like top gun then i guarantee you will love this movie also except for a few mild curse words this is an excellent movie for the whole family it has a great plot and does not have a dull moment throughout the entire movie every second is action packed and keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to see what happens next so once again i highly recommend this movie
<START> once again seeing this kind of movies turns me more and more into english humor not too often seen on screen since the days of monty python and man about the house too bad br br brenda <UNK> who i first saw in saving grace early in the year another must see by the way just excels as alfred <UNK> does the rest of the cast while virtually unknown to me turns on great performances too the film starts slowly and gradually <UNK> in pace and amusement <UNK> i had tears in my eyes from laughing br br all in all a funny english movie a thousand times better than the supposedly <UNK> garbage that comes from hollywood br br
<START> john <UNK> is an ex union officer who plans to sell his ranch and land to the over at anchor the trouble is that the price being offered is way to low and when they start to bully <UNK> and his workers he has a change of heart particularly when things take a brutal turn for the worse br br originally after watching this one i had a sense of frustration <UNK> because of the cast that was involved when you got edward g robinson glenn ford and barbara stanwyck in the same movie you hope that they get a story and script from which to <UNK> sadly they don't get chance to produce a western classic worthy of multiple <UNK> or is that my over expectation is doing it a <UNK> well i slept on it and decided to <UNK> further about the picture i think yes it's fair to say that the actors in question deserved a better story from which to work from it is when all is said and done a plot that has been <UNK> for all it's worth and then some but the violent men is still a very rewarding film regardless of the missed opportunities evident with the production br br glenn ford as <UNK> is as cool as an nose throughout and it's always great to see <UNK> stanwyck playing a bitch because she's good at it while eddie g when one gets used to him being in a western is fine in what is an under written part robinson who stepped in at the last minute when first choice as lee <UNK> crawford got injured is the one who is short changed the most by the makers even supporting characters such as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> delight from the reliable richard <UNK> and <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> foster get something to leave an impression with but for what it is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bad guy is at the least memorable for all the right reasons br br not shy on action and gun play it's with the twists and almost shakespearean <UNK> that <UNK> film rises above the mundane with all of it <UNK> framed by <UNK> stunning cinematography lone <UNK> in <UNK> has been used on many a western picture see seven men from now for another glorious use of it but here really excels and manages to <UNK> the eyes at every turn the violent men isn't a great western picture and perhaps a better director than could have really given donald <UNK> the big country novel an adaptation to be proud of but for every and <UNK> i personally had with it i found two more reasons to actually really like it so that it be it's recommended for sure 7 10
<START> <UNK> approach <UNK> itself in all his titles from the worst to the best he doesn't care or has no clue about art all he cares is to make people think they've got a kick in the <UNK> by watching his movies the problem is the effort is way too evident and as events unfold with all the senseless exaggeration into them the effort fails badly br br on this turkish movie who knows where the original or originals were made since it felt extremely <UNK> to me <UNK> is trying to be some sort of tarantino mr tarantino if you're reading this please watch the movie for the best comedy of your life he doesn't use subtle moves to do that all he does is to use extreme stuff and it gets <UNK> absurd and laughable br br as the <UNK> guy with the cow <UNK> hair is just hilarious i'm hoping to meet him in person and ask how he felt about this movie himself because i really found the role insulting for him <UNK> her <UNK> was also <UNK> for and did nothing other than making everything look fake another specifically idiotic aspect of this movie was the 100 <UNK> pace setting when things need to be taken slowly scenes flow abruptly and at other times it makes you sleepy to watch the slow <UNK> going on br br if <UNK> is so deeply in love with lame hollywood <UNK> he should use michael as his name instead even such a move wouldn't be half as ludicrous as what he has done on this movie he should first learn not to imitate directors whose levels he'll never approach then realize he's not in hollywood and then take private lessons from or on how to lay the flow of ideas out in the plot this useless movie couldn't be saved even by those but perhaps he can make watchable movies in the future by taking these steps br br by the way i've seen some infamous failures such as propaganda and and i still can't <UNK> from saying this one was the worst turkish movie ever
<START> you can find an anti war statement here without looking too hard that <UNK> is hackneyed or you can find a value neutral comment on the madness of war stripped of judgement that <UNK> is completely uninteresting br br or you can watch this for the darn good entertainment value of <UNK> one liners but that's just a <UNK> for commercial br br you can try to view this as a <UNK> vietnam war film but ask any veteran and he'll <UNK> down that notion most vets will say it stinks br br or view it as a <UNK> he or won't morality play nothing rich there either br br where i found the value was in the superb self reference coppola needed a <UNK> with great enough <UNK> the war to fit the greatness of the skilled multi dimensional actor playing 'a great man' br br brando the man was as much of a maverick as the <UNK> character the studios were uncomfortable with his acting <UNK> yet he always <UNK> and won <UNK> the are uncomfortable with in spite of his <UNK> genius br br so coppola makes a movie all about <UNK> greatness to hammer on the point he places himself in the movie as hopper a manic <UNK> laden with multiple cameras to <UNK> his <UNK> brando himself is only seen in half light and <UNK> brilliant cinematography by <UNK> that only <UNK> the actor's power and he goes out like the <UNK> bull to complete the narrative <UNK> oh yes the horror br br other pieces of interest the great use of point of view camera perspectives including <UNK> in the long before private ryan the ground breaking use of sound notably the ominous <UNK> and the <UNK> depiction of an acid trip br br don't get caught in the outer layers the rich part you should from this is the brilliant core of sound vision and self reference
<START> as one of the victims of the whole <UNK> scandal my mother forced me to watch this movie with her how many times can i say awful the script was so weak using cliche after cliche it seems as though the writers <UNK> this story together with a few <UNK> on <UNK> watching the movie we honestly were able to complete about half of the one dimensional characters' lines and thoughts i realize this was supposedly adapted from a book but was the book this bad i don't know what to say just terrible the best thing about the movie shannon elizabeth actually kept her clothes on other than that this movie gets a big fat f
<START> some famous stories are prone to being moved to another <UNK> and as such becoming an embarrassing tv movie oscar <UNK> ghost is one of them this tv movie for kids is utterly cheap concerning acting character work credibility directing and even concerning the modest special effects as often the question <UNK> what was this made for
<START> may be i don't get it right i mean the movie it does not make me happy or whatever has to do maybe because of my mood anyhow this one is a simple family movie with kids for actors just admit that all movies of that kind cannot pass the <UNK> of 4 out of 10 never mind who is playing in the movie example antonio <UNK> was playing in that kind of movies two or three of them cant remember the exact count i got bored i almost fall asleep just because the topic is so clich√© and the actor play was so predictable but i am sure that my kid will love this movie when he grows up hey im not a monster i found some hilarious or good moments in the movie the <UNK> in the movie were <UNK> cute the trick with the painted police car windows and the hits that the kid received in the head by a golf ball
<START> i saw the film many times and every time i am more and more disappointed which is shame because the films from ex <UNK> are usually very good the shame here is that tried to make film about the place and people it has no idea my self coming from the <UNK> <UNK> found this film disappointing simply that the <UNK> characters are not really understood and not truly portrayed to understand the mentality of a person from ex <UNK> you need to know their background way of live what makes them cry and laugh and the director of the film didn't took that as <UNK> when we ex <UNK> make films lots of symbolism is build in it which makes the characters <UNK> and likable and mostly portraying the truth if it is based on true story the films like village pretty flame <UNK> and <UNK> no mans <UNK> before the rain black cat white cat <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> when father was away on business <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> who sings over there rare the masterpiece of the <UNK> cinematography and nothing can compare to it not the half baked story of and studio as somebody from the <UNK> mentioned the story jumps from one end of town to the other with no real connection i am sorry but when the film is made is not only for the american <UNK> variety of viewers but for the rest of the world too and some of them live on the <UNK> and <UNK> too and to add insult to the injury half of the things are shoot in <UNK> where i come from my shock when i saw the broad st of in the opening scene of the film when the bride is shoot from the sniper and what was that <UNK> real footage of the news covering in the film anyway very disappointing as the truth is far away from the film shame that nobody <UNK> the real people how is to live in <UNK> under fire before they shoot the film book is one thing and real life is other and this film lets down both
<START> awful awful awful times a hundred still doesn't begin to describe how crappy biggest loser is picture this take two fat couples with nothing interesting to say <UNK> them and let them work to lose weight all on prime time television am i the only one who thinks that this isn't something people with <UNK> in the 3 <UNK> area want to watch everything drags on forever with the <UNK> of <UNK> whining on about how losing weight is going to mean so much for them and their lives does anyone care do they think we care do they care if we care probably not i think i'll <UNK> myself doing <UNK> and sell it to some major television corporation if this passes for television then so can my <UNK>
<START> being an avid carpenter fan i really loved this film although the <UNK> do leave a lot to be desired and agree with many of the comments that certain areas of her life were absent or not touched on whatever it leaves your curiosity well and truly <UNK> so off i went to discover more i must recommend a book by ray coleman <UNK> the <UNK> story the book is an intelligent read and unlike the film is <UNK> and down to earth i hope you enjoy it i remember <UNK> from her days in fame and gypsy she is a singer <UNK> as dancer in her own right and i think this was the edge needed to create the character some other actresses may have <UNK> with this it is <UNK> the film did not delve deeper into her story after all this is the film title but i felt we <UNK> more about richard but i suppose like any performer worth their salt you should always leave them wanting more
<START> i've just finished seeing the film for the first time in it's entirety although i watched some parts when it was first shown in britain in the mid 90's i truly believe it to be a masterpiece of late <UNK> century cinema a film of this scope raises lots of questions like why are there some narrative differences between the 60's <UNK> in and <UNK> in this film for example in the first film <UNK> has a fairly significant relationship with his <UNK> he <UNK> <UNK> electronic music whereas in die there is little mention of his dad until the final episode br br one other point does interest me reading up on edgar i'm struck by historical similarities between him and the <UNK> character spoiler coming in the last episode it is revealed that <UNK> has won a prize at the <UNK> film festival won an award for best debut work there for his film film company is called and <UNK> is also <UNK> named i'm interested in <UNK> being an <UNK> character because aside from <UNK> he is probably the least likable of the friends br br maybe <UNK> a red <UNK> i don't know what i do know is that i loved this film and wish that more were made like it with the exception of michael <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> man there's not enough ambition <UNK> and passion of this sort in modern cinema i can't wait to see number 3 now
<START> i rented this movie but i wasn't too sure what to expect of it i was very glad to find that it's about the best brazilian movie i've ever seen the story is rather odd and simple and above all extremely original we have antonio who is a young man living in a town in the middle of nowhere in the north east of brazil and who is deeply in love with the main conflict between the two is that while antonio loves his little town and has no wish to leave it wants to see the world and <UNK> the place as a prove of his love for her he decides to go out himself and bring the world to her he'll put in the map as he says and the way he does it is unbelievable this is a good movie might be a bit <UNK> for some people due to its different editing job but i think that it's also that that <UNK> the story it's just fun and it makes you feel good
<START> was a big disappointment for me i'd <UNK> how great it was how important it was it just didn't strike me it had a dim witted story line plus some moronic and sadistic native american characters that are offensive by today's standards while most of d w <UNK> films have depth and this one feels more like a formula programme picture br br i loved seeing <UNK> <UNK> and mae <UNK> in pre birth of a nation roles plus some of the staging of the battle scenes were pretty good to future griffith cameraman karl brown audiences were standing on their seats and cheering once the <UNK> comes riding in at the end i felt nothing and me i watching <UNK> early work at <UNK> this film just isn't what it used to be br br the best thing about this film it that for all of it's flaws it has many of <UNK> touches to it he handles his principal actors pretty well plus the scene where the indians are the cabin it reminiscent to the climax of birth of a nation a far superior film that would send shock waves across america a little over a year later
<START> this is one of those films where it is easy to see how some people wouldn't like it my wife has never seen it and when i just <UNK> it last night i waited until after she went to bed she might have been amused by a couple small snippets but i know she would have had enough within ten minutes br br head has nothing like a conventional story the film is firmly <UNK> in the psychedelic era it could be seen as <UNK> <UNK> in a nutshell or as something of a <UNK> acid trip through film genres if you're not a big fan of those things <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the acid trip aesthetic assuming there's a difference between them you should probably stay away from this film on the other hand if you are a fan of that stuff you need to run out and buy head now if you haven't already br br oddly the film has never received much respect that probably has a lot to do with <UNK> after all it does star the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jones michael and peter and the <UNK> were a musical group of actors put together by producers bob and bert schneider to be a kid friendly bubble <UNK> beatles for a television series in their era they had as much respect as say new kids on the block the spice girls and so on as a fellow imdb reviewer rightly notes perhaps people in 1968 thinking of the <UNK> as a silly factory made pop band rip off of the beatles refused to see head br br the <UNK> and head have never been quite able to shed that negative public perception it's a shame because there was a lot of talent both <UNK> and otherwise in the <UNK> it's probably <UNK> that who directs here and co produces with schneider and jack nicholson yes that jack nicholson who wrote the script and also co produces decided to take the <UNK> in this unusual direction it's as if new kids on the block suddenly put out an album equivalent to pink <UNK> 1969 or <UNK> heart mother 1970 in fact the songs in head written by the <UNK> and frequent <UNK> such as carole king and harry <UNK> have a <UNK> like quality somewhere between the <UNK> <UNK> era and the immediate post <UNK> era this is much more prominent than any beatles similarity some people have complained about the music in the film but to me all the songs are gems for that matter some people dislike <UNK> era or other <UNK> which is just as difficult for me to empathize with br br but what is head about the basic <UNK> is just that the <UNK> are taking a trip through various film genres there are war scenes adventure scenes horror scenes comedy scenes drama scenes western scenes sci fi scenes romance scenes and on and on except in the film's reality this turns out to be happening primarily if not exclusively on a studio lot at root we're watching the <UNK> shoot a film of course all of the scenes in the various genres have something surreal and self <UNK> about them and they and individual shots within a scene tend to lead to one another using dream logic not <UNK> to the monty python television show as a dream head tends to <UNK> between a good dream and a nightmare while often being one that would cause you to laugh in your sleep something that i frequently do by the way br br technically uses a wide variety of techniques to realize the above there are scenes with extensive negative images there are a lot of very fast cuts including a great sequence that features <UNK> jones and tony basil dancing alternately in a white and a black room wearing a combination of white and black <UNK> in each that occasionally back and forth as quickly as two frames at a time there are a lot of bizarre <UNK> there is an animated cow mouth there are odd editing devices and so on for my money i wish this stuff wasn't just a <UNK> of the psychedelic era this is the kind of artistic approach i <UNK> it seemed like a good idea back then and i still think it's a good idea i'd like to see films like the life <UNK> with steve using 2004 using these types of extended techniques now that would make that film surreal br br some folks who aren't so in tune with the acid trip aesthetic have complained that it's basically b s to offer meanings for something intended to not have any i disagree with such a <UNK> <UNK> view head was intended to have a lot of meaning s and it's not just films without conventional plots that have multiple interpretations nicholson and schneider have a lot of interesting things to say about the <UNK> the film comments on their <UNK> status pop stardom way before pink <UNK> head pop stardom and violence from images of war to images of fans <UNK> their <UNK> and <UNK> u s oriented ideas of international <UNK> and respect well armed <UNK> in a desert surrender to <UNK> <UNK> just because he's an american then later they blow up a coke machine again in the desert for him because he's <UNK> and can't gain access the film comments on many other topics from big industry to police <UNK> especially in relation to <UNK> and on and on head is full of ideas appropriately enough with intelligent <UNK> things to say about them br br head deserves to be considered a classic it's basically shooting for the same vibe as the <UNK> yellow submarine both premiered in november of 1968 interestingly enough and both were intended as something of a <UNK> of the psychedelic aesthetic yellow submarine wasn't quite successful head is everything yellow submarine should have been
<START> what can i say you expect only the best in drama from the bbc and <UNK> is not an exception to the rule br br <UNK> is a great thriller a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> them with silver <UNK> police officer red <UNK> ken and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events before more lives are lost br br but be warned despite it's rating in the uk <UNK> is a bit of a gruesome film some of the murder scenes are similar to those in <UNK> and one or two can be really stomach <UNK> but if you can <UNK> that sit back in your chair and enjoy although you'll most likely be on the edge of it or hiding behind it br br rated by the <UNK> for <UNK> violence and strong horror
<START> for the main criticisms of the movie the love story that wasn't a love story those were two people <UNK> coming together trying to find humanity in anyone the same thing happened with soldiers and the russian boy it added a feminine touch but come on look at american movies no where close to love story there was no storyline does war have a storyline i think that is a silly criticism the storyline is this they start with 400 men and the movie <UNK> down to show the lives of about 10 men and how each did their part and died death is the ultimate end to any story just because there was no happy ending doesn't mean it has no storyline br br there was a horrid truth in this movie i wouldn't necessarily call it anti war it had a political statement of course but the movie wasn't all about the politics in fact except for a few <UNK> when the captain showed up there was never a <UNK> air of nazi germany they were far enough out of the reach of the main nazi party the fat cats weren't gonna go into russia br br maybe not completely accurate and not a hollywood hit but it <UNK> a fine knowledge of the common soldier i'd say exactly of almost any <UNK> and war and what they must go through it was a losing battle of course the movie is going to be depressing and to the person who said that it was <UNK> and silly to even portray germans as victims there are victims on all sides in every war any real soldier will tell you that br br this movie is a fine balance between movie and documentary a few problems with it when arguing for just one but it <UNK> the best of both worlds watch it as such beware however because it is a hard movie to watch if not <UNK> emotionally br br i'm waiting <UNK> they make a movie about iraq it will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial i want to see who has the guts to do it first <UNK> doesn't count
<START> from the start this film drags and drags clumsy <UNK> explaining the history <UNK> acting boring sets total lack of any humanity <UNK> or style the actors look as if they are drugged potentially an interesting story completely wasted surely somebody realised how bad it was at some point in producing it
<START> i just saw <UNK> and felt that i had to comment on this film <UNK> is a difficult topic in any field and unfortunately is can sometimes <UNK> the true value of a movie many people have <UNK> about the excellent cast and it's beautiful imagery camera work certainly <UNK> <UNK> is an actor that brings something extra to each film he makes to say that he <UNK> the real is a little silly since i don't think that any of the reviewers have known personally to lie still and use a certain charm is a acting skill that although well performed doesn't <UNK> a <UNK> performance <UNK> just does what he does well and that's it the camera work is beautiful and evokes feelings and perspectives that the movie itself lacks to deliver here is shown as a man that is bend on dying so much that he leaves his loving family behind and marries a woman that he only seeks out when the other will not help him in his quest for a <UNK> death now i'm not here to say anything about the right for or against <UNK> the problem is that when commenting movies like this you can hardly escape it the movie's subject is so strong that you're almost compelled to discuss the movie in that strong subject matter i find it a weakness for the movie unintentionally portrays as a character someone who is much smarter then his family as portrayed in the simple cousin that doesn't get the double layered poem directed towards him someone who will leave a loving and caring family because he thinks his life is a scene that is <UNK> to the female lawyer who according to the movie makes the wrong choice ending up in a far state of <UNK> thus <UNK> that choice was the right one the woman that constantly seeks him out is almost <UNK> for the beautiful lawyer but suddenly is married by when she agrees to help him die these choices make into a <UNK> figure no matter how charming <UNK> portrays him i would say it doesn't convince fully and i kinda think that <UNK> didn't intend on adding this <UNK> element in his film for a young director it's still an impressive film and it certainly has it's strong moments the discussion between the priest and for instance the camera work is impressive and the film is well acted but 10 out of 10 no the movie doesn't reach that excellence
<START> being a former mst3k watcher even i found this movie unwatchable the awful attempts at humor heck the awful attempts at acting nobody needs to read a <UNK> on this piece of junk br br i just like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by cast members or family friends just click on their other reviews and wow they are all reviewing modern vampires give me a couple of bucks and i can make a movie better than this one of the most incompetent pieces of film making i've ever seen and that's saying something watch at your own risk br br rating 0 10
<START> i'm <UNK> this film on a <UNK> in other words it isn't the greatest film that has ever been made but it does exactly what it set out to do this is an excellent t a film i have no idea the count of how many <UNK> or <UNK> were seen in this film but i did see one shot that had 16 bare <UNK> at one time just to give you an idea there are topless girls all throughout there is a wet t shirt contest scene and the climax involves a game of touch football between two all girl teams and every time one scores a <UNK> the entire <UNK> team losing a piece of clothes i don't know why this gets such a low rating here perhaps the people who gave it low scores thought they were going to see citizen kane i love this movie and hope to find more similar ones if you are looking for a good campy t a film i'd recommend this one
<START> <UNK> is the touching story of <UNK> gotta love <UNK> film titles an ex con who probably should still be in jail he gets in trouble with cops friends drug dealers women prostitutes and society in general he's just not that likable a guy neither is the movie though it's still hilarious and worth watching br br the flimsy premise is that <UNK> played with as much enthusiasm as star <UNK> ray moore can <UNK> is in jail for a crime he claims he didn't commit when a drug hit or a drug bust or drug something is about to go down the warden releases him to stop it or help it or just watch it not very clear all i know is that i was unaware that the justice system <UNK> <UNK> in order to allow them to prove their own innocence my ignorance i guess br br the plot is convoluted and <UNK> basically <UNK> goes around killing people usually with very poorly choreographed karate having sex and <UNK> out people sometimes even <UNK> too the <UNK> of the movie are its total incompetence and its total indifference in the matter br br i stopped counting the number of times i saw the boom mike after it was in one scene for the entire duration about two minutes of film i stopped questioning why the warden was looking down at where <UNK> was sitting even after he stood up and walked around when they cut back to the establishing shot and <UNK> was inexplicably sitting down again i stopped wondering why <UNK> dressed like that when he got naked on the street to change because he didn't want to get in his car with the ugly read normal clothes the jail gave him and i stopped wondering where he learned karate when he his hand on a guy's stomach and somehow cuts him open the only time i was ever remotely nervous and tense was when the disgusting <UNK> white mayor is walking around totally naked with nothing but a <UNK> hanging around his neck which just barely covers him up you keep saying cut away cut away cut away but by the time they do you are already emotionally <UNK> br br the movie is ridiculous in every way imaginable moore as <UNK> is either funny cool or both if you're on the <UNK> for a bad movie you have found it with <UNK>
<START> this is only the fourth effort <UNK> watched from this director whom i met and found quite <UNK> at the 2004 <UNK> film festival italian b movie <UNK> and also possibly the worst as was the case with the <UNK> <UNK> 1989 which <UNK> it this is a prime example from the tail end of the euro cult era √¢¬Ä¬ì prime because it shows the depths to which the previously <UNK> style had fallen by this time br br here in fact we get a plot revolving around √¢¬Ä¬ì <UNK> not kidding folks √¢¬Ä¬ì a killer phone pretty but bland charlotte lewis √¢¬Ä¬ì in her third film after pirates 1986 and the golden child 1986 √¢¬Ä¬ì is a model who apparently has just ended an affair she keeps expecting her architect lover to call her back but every time the phone rings all she gets is static accompanied by voices from the beyond or some such crap she befriends a new tenant at her apartment block who conveniently knows of an authority on <UNK> activity william <UNK> √¢¬Ä¬ì who hilariously explains that the negative energy which is unleashed say during family arguments can <UNK> itself via home <UNK> into a deadly force i swear i making this up br br among the highlights er <UNK> of the film are the grumpy bartender from whose <UNK> place the heroine calls a couple of times it seems that the chain of events can only be broken by having lewis go through her <UNK> again <UNK> angel <UNK> style the sheer variety of preposterous looking phones on display the <UNK> of the photographer friend <UNK> up on her before the kill the sarcastic cop who <UNK> lewis on <UNK> the strange <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> up to i wonder the would be rapist killed by a <UNK> of <UNK> shooting out from a <UNK> booth and own bloody demise with the phone affecting the <UNK> <UNK> with and causing the heart to explode br br the <UNK> climax is rather confusing and apparently finally sees all the <UNK> a flock of <UNK> and flying out the window of the office a service for what <UNK> worth the score √¢¬Ä¬ì by ex <UNK> <UNK> no less √¢¬Ä¬ì is effective enough despite the inclusion of dated heavy metal numbers on the soundtrack
<START> if you read the plot summary for mad max you've just ruined the first 1 hour and 10 minutes of the film you've also found out that mad max takes place in post apocalyptic australia which will be helpful because otherwise you won't have any idea what's going on the film made in 1979 tries really hard to be stanley kubrick's a clockwork orange 1971 only that film in all its <UNK> actually makes sense and leaves an impact this film does neither and ends up being a car bike stunt filled romp that crashes like every vehicle in the film does br br the first thing wrong with mad max is that it tries to sell itself as a revenge tale when no vigilante appears to take revenge until the final 20 minutes if the first hour were <UNK> to 20 30 minutes and then the final 20 added on and then another hour added after that mad max would be a cool action film with a great vigilante protagonist instead mel gibson has to wait around and act like a sissy for 2 3 of the film and then have a sudden <UNK> to seek revenge i've yet to watch the sequel road warrior and i have to admit i'm excited for it only because i want to know what he does next this first film was mostly a waste of time br br george miller does some great action stuff here but his over the top symbolism is absurd and the unbearable cheesy reaction sequences every time a character discovers something horrifying like a burnt hand or what have you completely ruins those moments its a terribly clich√© b movie technique br br there is absolutely no <UNK> value or subtle critique of society in this film no matter what you might think a great action sci fi movie at least makes a point but the gratuitous violence done by random weird <UNK> doesn't say anything of value even the villain feels <UNK> off alex of clockwork only <UNK> and completely <UNK> the pg violence just does not allow the violence of this gang to settle in and get a reaction from the viewer it just <UNK> it up if anything br br i'll give credit for the amount of stuff the film crew blew up and crashed into things and miller does a great job making you feel the intensity of the <UNK> everything else is mediocre at best and then after an hour of mediocrity you get something good and the film ends 20 minutes later i'm just crossing my fingers road warrior will fulfill the expectations of where this film ends otherwise that's more time wasted steven c br br visit my site at http <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> latter days for me was a very moving film it showed just how hard and <UNK> the gay community really is the film true passion and really explores the feelings of these two characters the film holds a real depth of compassion for the gay community as it really speaks out for the gay man woman personally i think it's about high time that the homosexual community of all <UNK> should no longer hold there head in shame just for being there beautiful self the film was very much of a eye opener for me as i could not believe how anti homosexual this world really is even at schools if a kid <UNK> something they will refer to it as being gay i real hope that more film like this one are made and that they are not just <UNK> as a gay film but as a love story as i believe that gay directors should stick up for themselves and tell their story through their eyes
<START> michael jackson is the greatest singer and the greatest dancer that ever lived and this film proves it it is brilliant to watch and the dance is fantastic when michael turns into a werewolf is a bit of an on the edge of your seat part the first time you watch it and vincent <UNK> rap adds to the fear when all the zombies a rising from their graves if you like this then i suggest you buy <UNK> michael jackson's <UNK> which has the film then the making of it after it the making shows an unbelievable performance of by michael which is when he first did on television the <UNK> watch it
<START> betty and boris eye each other at a junior dance when they're still kids but unfortunately hugh gets to her first and thirty years later when we tune back in betty is married to hugh and putting up with his <UNK> mother who also lives with them br br neither boris nor betty however have forgotten each other and when their paths cross again they soon <UNK> their feelings br br but betty feels she can't divorce hugh a it would hurt him too much what betty doesn't know is hugh isn't hurting at all he's rolling in the sheets with his beautiful secretary meredith br br boris an undertaker thinks he has the answer they'll fake her death br br christopher walken plays frank an outrageous competing undertaker in their medium sized town that causes additional problems for boris and betty br br all kinds of complications <UNK> as boris and betty try to pull off this major coup br br there are laugh out loud scenes some delightful dancing and <UNK> a curse word to be heard in short the film was a pleasure to watch br br 10 stars
<START> i also joined imdb for the sole purpose of commenting on this film but so that i can sing its <UNK> i had never heard of this movie it's <UNK> so horribly that it's easy to see why it may get passed over but a good friend suggested it to me and i'm so glad she did it's a gem of a film the actors are great kathy bates and meredith <UNK> in particular and look like they are truly having a fun time sure at times it was a bit over the top but i cannot remember the last time i laughed so hard or so many times over the course of two hours if you love to laugh then you owe it to yourself to see this film br br highly recommended
<START> it was a sweet intro for the most sailor soldier sailor <UNK> it consisted with a new in he at the wrote a love letter to <UNK> which would be of course and now <UNK> he is a <UNK> and he is attractive he ended up looking like <UNK> this was a it's no skin off my neck scene hot well i really like the <UNK> sailor moon series i personally think its the best anime ever but this movie was nice funny but not as as sailor moon r it was more like the s movie i saw this sailor moon with real player and it was pretty good over all
<START> what a terrible movie it represents perfectly the state of of french society where the most <UNK> respect for wholesome values and traditions has completely disappeared the plot is nonsensical the movie is not funny at all and the characters are completely shallow and uninteresting to say the least the direction and the cinematography are very poor and uninspired catherine <UNK> is as bad an actress as she always was even when she was directed by <UNK> in belle de <UNK> the rest of the usually good cast vincent <UNK> line jean seem completely lost in an ocean of <UNK> <UNK> and i cannot help to draw a parallel with the wonderful james le divorce with its thoughtful depiction of french and american <UNK> its <UNK> cinematography and stellar cast put to good use having watched le divorce you can feel a kind of empathy with the french regardless of their <UNK> belle <UNK> leaves you with only a <UNK> contempt for its morally <UNK> and clueless protagonists
<START> <UNK> was a terribly disappointing film for me i had expected much from a jim <UNK> production and had found <UNK> reviews comparing it to the <UNK> and alice in wonderland unfortunately the film ended up in one of those style over substance pile of movies br br whereas most kids dream about running away from home to join a circus helena is a kid who has grown up in a circus child <UNK> anyone who wishes to run away to join real life helena wishes that her mother drop dead which is a bad move for a spoiled brat with a princess complex in a kid's fantasy movie next thing you know <UNK> mother <UNK> over and for some reason she is suddenly transported to another world br br meanwhile i felt as if i was transported to the museum of contemporary art with a pair of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> glasses br br the showcase of cgi generated creatures and backdrop was interesting at first and i liked the <UNK> giants it got a little too tiresome after a few minutes though and i felt my mind wandering br br with no sense of narrative and mtv style clips and soundtrack the reminded me of basement where's your head at i did not feel involved in the plight of the protagonist and also frustrated as we waited for the film to lead us wherever it wanted hopefully towards the exit signs of the theatre
<START> just as in <UNK> the most compelling scene in the movie is the <UNK> silence of the jewel heist the scene is masterful in its execution each of the robbers having their own <UNK> job to perform each one successfully combining their own unique talent towards the objective and each one until a month before complete strangers br br many of the scenes play out very slowly in fact the opening scene is a long character introduction to both corey and <UNK> as we see corey getting released from prison and <UNK> escaping capture on his way to prison the two characters are then <UNK> brought together through fate at a <UNK> diner as <UNK> hides inside the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> from this improbable break in the two strangers agree to become partners to commit a <UNK> and precise jewel heist br br however to pull of this heist they must include the help of a third man named <UNK> <UNK> is hired as the sure shot gun man his inclusion into the mix was an interesting and desperate choice at the time of his hire <UNK> is in a full battle with <UNK> and spent most of his day on his <UNK> <UNK> over <UNK> snakes and <UNK> his transition from the <UNK> and <UNK> world of a william s <UNK> dream into the steady handed and sober sharp <UNK> is a very quick one and perhaps the only real false moment of the film but that's just me being extremely <UNK> br br one other mildly false note was that of the police inspector mattei at times he appeared to be brilliant in the ways of strong <UNK> the right people or gathering information and waiting out for his escaped prisoner to make his move other times he appeared to be 10 years past retirement especially at the beginning during escape through the woods br br i wonder if i got too much hidden meaning from the beginning of the movie at the start of the movie as the police car is <UNK> through the city the first image we see is that of a red stop light my first thought was that this may be the <UNK> and that if i am to find a deeper meaning in the movie perhaps it is that this car or rather the people inside of it going through the red light will be the ones who will <UNK> the jewel heist <UNK> br br perhaps the red circle refers to the <UNK> ring perhaps it was the burning <UNK> no matter br br it's a long movie but it doesn't feel that way the ending is a bit of a disappointment it seemed too <UNK> for a movie that felt like such a delicious slow burn 9 10 br br clark richards
<START> this film is one to spend the short while entertainment but who then could be made in nobody country it does not have anything <UNK> the <UNK> who looks for the topics of the supposed <UNK> or socially and politically correct cinema and what it is it <UNK> it is better than it is not going to see this film some to the drug traffic or the fight is no reference either farmer and worker or wing <UNK> and to the kidnapping political br br the corrupt police is a <UNK> who it could be mexican russian italian or chinese and also the <UNK> protagonist an <UNK> photographer it could be <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> and the frequent in its it could be replaced by another word of <UNK> of any other country without the <UNK> or history changes the important thing is that it is a very <UNK> counted history with images and right performances its quality almost is of tv movie but of the good ones that if one film like this if it deserves or does not deserve the support with <UNK> <UNK> a little is a classic discussion
<START> this interesting film noir features three very good performances sanders patrick and the scenes between sanders and patrick are particularly outstanding as the detective is unfortunately not nearly as good he lacks the intelligence strength and cynical world view of a bogart had <UNK> played this part we could have had a classic br br pace location a library and atmosphere are all good but there are a few plot holes sanders strongly fears and the ruthless organization nazis he represents yet after <UNK> killing sanders seems to experience no anxiety or <UNK> sanders then <UNK> the library and its <UNK> by using the <UNK> that he and his men are detectives investigating the murder however <UNK> hit man later tries to kill by shooting him without a <UNK> even though the many other could have been expected to hear and become <UNK> by the noise finally <UNK> hit man tries to kill roberts who has discovered the truth but when she <UNK> he inexplicably does not br br what bothered me the most however was that the chance for a great and unexpected conclusion was wasted throughout the film patrick is portrayed as a smart hard as nails <UNK> <UNK> nothing yet at the end she <UNK> panic stricken from the last surviving nazi a <UNK> thug by the time the cops find him he has killed her and she ends up being just another weak stereotypical victim what should have happened is this the cops find the nazi thug but he is dead she has cleverly killed him and then <UNK> to continue her evil ways
<START> batman returns is a really dark movie that shows the <UNK> <UNK> fighting against the penguin and the sexy <UNK> i'll get to them later michael keaton acts well as bruce wayne showing he is a good actor tim burton directs this picture well and the locations of the movie are impressive the villains danny <UNK> is menacing as the penguin a cruel yet disturbed man that had a really hard childhood but michelle pfeiffer steals the picture she is the best <UNK> ever she is threatening and extremely sexy there's a scene where she kisses batman the cat way that just <UNK> the movie up the action scenes are good too and the ending is dramatic and tragic probably the best ending of a batman movie tim burton shows he can manage a batman movie really well he already demonstrated this with the first batman and also gives batman a darker nature so much like him
<START> what a <UNK> film dress actors in <UNK> <UNK> place in suburban <UNK> set cameras rolling and hope for the best one can only imagine e the thanks the cast gave when their characters were killed off by thus <UNK> them further <UNK> in this this rivals monster a go go as the best cure for insomnia ever made oh god how can i fill up 10 lines explaining how <UNK> bored everybody looks in this movie <UNK> crappy plastic <UNK> robot who <UNK> everybody both on and off screen giant spider reduced to a single giant hairy leg pulled by string actors desperately trying not to look at the camera while <UNK> off dialogs
<START> when this series aired i watched most of it i think it was supposed to be a long running series in the vein of the fugitive and the incredible hulk where the protagonist is being chased around the country looking for a solution to his problems in this case the hero's problem is his <UNK> aging in reverse i liked what i saw of these shows the acting was good especially the <UNK> relationship between the lead character and his wife problem is they cancelled it before it had a chance to end either that or i missed the last episodes br br they never got a chance to wrap up the story either knowing it had been cancelled <UNK> it was just gone however like i said before i might have missed the last episodes but my proof to the contrary is this i rented the tape where i left off in the series the lead character's wife dies in a fire started by a chase involving king's famous organization the shop while getting away hero is kidnapped it ends with his friends realizing they have to go save him from the shop the end last episode on the video his wife does not die but escapes the fire with him right when he should get <UNK> by the shop he and his wife share a weird moment then phase out of existence abrupt silly and cheap to the extreme they just wanted to put this video out and decided to tag on an ending not caring how bad it was they might as well of just shown some stock footage of the first atomic bomb almost br br the show did have a cool opening title sequence set to the david <UNK> song of the same name
<START> a boat <UNK> in a sleepy town in <UNK> is going out of business and the lives of all of the soon to be ex workers and families are <UNK> the biggest disappointment is that the two stars bates and bridges have only bit parts br br interesting but not something you would see twice br br
<START> badly shot badly edited clumsy dialogue flat characters <UNK> adaption of a novel it doesn't really get much worse decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half felt more like three hours of boredom occasional good one liners br br david is a dim witted young man who has never <UNK> from losing his brother at an early age he puts his faith in a chinese philosophy <UNK> <UNK> video although that doesn't seem to help him much in real life david is a member of a debt <UNK> gang where every member has an iq below sea level a lacking script along with <UNK> shooting and even worse editing make what could have been quite funny incidents of failed debt collecting look like a amateurish <UNK> reality show br br david <UNK> an apartment from an <UNK> school teacher who by dropping a couple of sentences about his own importance convinces david he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in <UNK> a severely lacking script doesn't offer david anything to base his opinion on a couple of scenes showing doing something that david could have <UNK> would have done the work the <UNK> of film as media as opposed to the text of the book this film is based on are not exploited br br at first david's connection with raises his status within the debt <UNK> gang but the <UNK> paranoia in the criminal world forces david to show where his loyalty lies br br the plot of the film is fine but then it is based on the book this could have been a much better film a good screenwriter could have made something of this material sadly that is not the case br br the acting is generally good is excellent and credible as david <UNK> doesn't get much to work with but does his best with what little material he has and michael <UNK> in a tiny role manage alright br br overall opinion what could have been quite a funny and entertaining film about a dim witted anti hero in a debt <UNK> gang becomes a boring badly crafted film made after a poor <UNK> staring at your <UNK> for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable
<START> filmmaker bryan forbes who once displayed a light <UNK> touch with <UNK> material such as <UNK> down the wind and the original <UNK> wives completely <UNK> out here not only is his direction inept he also <UNK> adapted sidney early novel the results are atrocious roger moore plays a psychiatrist framed for the murder of one of his patients rod <UNK> chewing the scenery is a hot under the collar cop it's easily his most embarrassing performance the only actor here to exhibit some life is elliott <UNK> who knows a thing or two about <UNK> a bum script bland choppy and produced on the cheap no stars from
<START> predictable gory over <UNK> mediocre don't waste your time there are many much better movies out there br br <UNK> starts out ok but the plot quickly becomes repetitive my interest level fell off <UNK> by the end of the movie i was just glad it was finally over the characters never fully developed the cinematography is <UNK> and the quick change <UNK> <UNK> while impressive in 1999 perhaps <UNK> merely serve to label the movie as attempting to substitute gee <UNK> flash for plot and character substance the film shooting gimmicks serve some purpose convey tension and anxiety but are constantly <UNK> and ultimately become <UNK> a shame overall the film story obviously had potential and the producers directors and actors obviously have technical skill a disappointment
<START> i like to think of myself as a bad movie <UNK> i like to think that the films most people label as the worst of all time i can easily <UNK> br br but there are exceptions i can only recall three movies i have had the misfortune to see that i have repeatedly used the fast forward button for large <UNK> of the story those movies are the mighty <UNK> night of the <UNK> and this little crap deep blood br br in the world of jaws <UNK> this falls off the scale deep blood doesn't have the realistic storyline of the original crocodile nor the incredible effects of the sea <UNK> nor the commentary of <UNK> no instead we are treated to a handful of teens from any random failed '80s public access sitcom battling bullies and the local sheriff br br shark attacks are realized by quick cuts of documentary footage with actors <UNK> about in the water occasionally with a bit of what appears to be orange ish paint thrown into the water not a minute of original shark footage exists in this celluloid waste dump br br normally i or somebody like me would read a dismal review like this one and say cool i gotta find a copy of this that's the same thought i had when i read another viewer's review on this very site how wrong i was br br so from one bad movie fan to another let this collect dust on the shelf grab up from the depths or the great alligator instead to satisfy your need for something evil lurking in the water
<START> this movie is so predictable when you know the modern american dream do nothing be a loser and then suddenly <UNK> you're a genius and an obnoxious one and the world is kissing the ground you are walking on br br and surprisingly all the other smart people are losers they don't know anything and are bitter when our <UNK> problems so easily and what kind of problems they are so difficult but still these <UNK> can <UNK> the results in less than 10 seconds br br every movie has something good in it anyway and robin williams is it in this one
<START> spoilers warning i cannot say enough good things about this movie it is a great horror comedy spoof that does everything right for a change the humor is great and <UNK> from funny to so funny you'll cry funny in one scene ed goes edit crazy and <UNK> a big scene when his boss is looking at <UNK> edit he yells out where in the fu is my <UNK> rape scene hysterical there are also many other great humorous memorable quotes and moments throughout ed yells out don't you fu ing look at me while <UNK> some poor <UNK> repeatedly in the face very funny stuff the plot of the movie itself is so ridiculous that it's priceless ed is a mild mannered everyday guy that gets moved over to the horror film editing department and after a while goes nuts sees monsters and attacks people while <UNK> the horror movies that he has edited this movie has it all and is simply hilarious the dvd only costs about 7 and is a great bargain as it is the <UNK> widescreen cut i own a lot of dvd's most of which cost a lot more money than this one but not many are as great as this movie my evil ed dvd is one of the highlights of my collection and i would beat someone with a <UNK> <UNK> if they tried to steal it evil ed <UNK> style and quality something that hollywood filmmakers need to <UNK> learn evil ed is a rare gem and i would like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful movie you did everything right and i love evil ed 10 out of 10
<START> br br it wasn't the worst movie that i have ever seen however that is only if i get to count home movies made by 8 year olds this movie was horrible from start to finish nothing about it made it worth watching unless you wanted to show new filmmakers how not to make a film
<START> this is a children's tv series about a mary sue who is at the same time mean and bitchy i couldn't bring my self to sit through 3 episodes of not to mention that jamie <UNK> spears can't act to save her life what message does this show bring to kids if you're not perfect like <UNK> you're <UNK> br br it's absurd how character is exactly the type of person who would be <UNK> in real life yet she manages to become so popular then there is chase who is basically a <UNK> puppy who <UNK> the ground <UNK> walks on then there is the fact that all the other characters seem to have been <UNK> down in order to stop them from <UNK> <UNK> i'm sorry but the characterization in this show extremely unrealistic
<START> i really wanted to like this film however after an amusing opening few minutes i hardly <UNK> a smile i agree there was no chemistry at all between the two leads and the other characters were cliche ridden the script totally wasted the talents of bud <UNK> and kim br br it must be said however that there was plenty of laughter around me and even a <UNK> of applause at the end perhaps i just couldn't relate to it enough i'm just glad i went on cheap tickets
<START> from the perspective of the <UNK> contemporary world in which we live the so called good old <UNK> always seem so much more <UNK> and innocent an <UNK> era gone by of which we have only memories and shadows that <UNK> on the silver screen as with christmas in <UNK> ' a warm and endearing film directed by peter <UNK> barbara stanwyck stars as elizabeth lane a popular martha type magazine <UNK> who writes about life on her beloved farm in <UNK> always with the latest recipe at the center of the story one of her biggest fans is alexander <UNK> played by sidney <UNK> the <UNK> of the magazine for which she writes <UNK> has never visited her farm and in response to an idea expressed to him in a letter from a nurse mary <UNK> <UNK> he decides to spend an old fashioned christmas with elizabeth her husband and child and as a special guest a certain mr <UNK> jones dennis morgan a sailor just <UNK> from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was <UNK> elizabeth of course cannot refuse her boss but there are problems not the least of which is the fact that she has no farm and writes her <UNK> from the comfort of a high rise in the city it makes for a <UNK> situation for her as well as her editor dudley <UNK> robert <UNK> as the one thing mr <UNK> demands from his employees is total honesty what follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that <UNK> the audience back to a seemingly more simple time and place to share a christmas past where a warm <UNK> good food and kindness <UNK> br br barbara stanwyck absolutely <UNK> as elizabeth with a smile and presence <UNK> than anything the <UNK> <UNK> could provide and totally convincing as a city girl entirely out of her element on the farm morgan also <UNK> well as the somewhat naive sailor whose trust in his fellow man is admirable even with the <UNK> being played out around him he's the kind of guy you know will somehow land on his feet and in the end it's elizabeth you really feel for one of the true <UNK> of this film however is sidney <UNK> his <UNK> has a gruff exterior but beneath you know without a doubt that this is a man with a heart as big as texas it's a straightforward honest portrayal and it's a joy to watch him work the most memorable scenes in the movie belong to him br br the supporting cast includes <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> the terrific <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> frank <UNK> and dick elliott judge <UNK> a feel good movie that plays especially well during the christmas season though it would work any time of the year christmas in is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously is thoroughly uplifting and will leave you with a warm spot in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be it's a true classic and one you do not want to miss i rate this one 10 10 br br
<START> the film was half over before i managed to figure out what was going on it's a <UNK> breakfast of a movie about four family <UNK> <UNK> the cliches and stereotypes <UNK> over each other when it's all over ten hours later well it seems like ten hours you're puzzling over what it was all about i don't want to see a movie about dinner table <UNK> there is enough of it in my own family the <UNK> looked pretty good the rest gave me <UNK>
<START> background info the movies <UNK> never say never again were both made the same year 1983 and so naturally people compare them moore vs connery bond vs bond br br i've heard many people claiming that the official movie <UNK> is far superior well i just watched <UNK> bond is riding an airplane at 100 miles an hour impossible the wind would blow him off using his feet to force the plane to ground and then jumping off at some 60 miles an hour again impossible try jumping out of your car you'd end up with a <UNK> body how is that <UNK> scene supposed to be good in any sense of the word suddenly bond has super human strength a <UNK> body and he does all these stunts at the ancient age of <UNK> complete crap unbelievable <UNK> br br now let's contrast the above scene with <UNK> <UNK> never say never again it doesn't have the same polish due to its independent film status less money but at least you can believe that connery is a real spy in real danger br br the movie starts off with bond showing his age he is 50 after all and being sent off for entirely believable but of course there's no such thing as a day off for a world famous spy and bond quickly finds himself a target even inside the hospital from that point the story <UNK> off into another adventure with bond trying to locate his attempted killers and ultimately <UNK> an attempt to steal nuclear weapons br br as usual sean connery did a brilliant job and avoids the over the top unbelievable stunts this movie feels like a natural <UNK> to <UNK> last film <UNK> are forever the old style of bond before the franchise got silly br br recommended
<START> the guy mentioned to sue for the 1 5 hours wasted of his life i cant disagree on that one the movie started as some kind of class project <UNK> thing and ended up in a dark room whenever the girls where fully nude there magically appeared light all over i know i <UNK> write the script or having anything to say about it but this one is like a bad remake copy of saw with a bad ending to think of a man who actually wrote this story sick this is really a shocking movie cant say <UNK> horror cause its not its mere the brutality and the violence that made me sick it really is frustrating to watch a movie without ending its like bang in your face the movie is done now you can go home br br cons <UNK> lighting i think is was supposed to overdone sickening br br cons real in your face acting was good in my opinion it sucks you in br br overall the movie is not my taste of movie the wanted us to know that these things happen and the man wrote his own little fantasy if you ever saw the movies saw they all had a moment of comfort in it something to hold on to this one does not maybe its just me that im too soft but this movie made me <UNK> and the story is real short sick man kills girls slowly but the actors sucked you in this movie every blow every scream you could almost feel it br br and to be honest i was to quick to judge about this one its a terrible movie no its not its an overdone example of reality this is a real as it could get but don't watch this movie if you expect great mystery or a real plot or even some kind of story man gets girls in a dark room and kills em one by one thats really it
<START> loved this movie kicking it old school love the idea love the script love the characters i really really really loved the <UNK> i was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being <UNK> this was right up with my such as saturday the <UNK> and <UNK> if you are a big fan of scary and silly then this is your movie only taken off one star because i would love to have had better sound not bad sound but would have liked to have more great blood <UNK> great murder weapons great costumes i really love the nod to the great 80's teenager stereotype ala breakfast club and i can appreciate the non cgi suspense really good camera action and light suspense instead of cutting to cgi i would rather have good fake that really fake fake br br kisses to the cast and makers oh loved the making of too
<START> this movie is just brilliant <UNK> acting is just amazing the end is so incredibly sad i cry every time i see this film it's the kind you never get sick of and can see again and again an absolutely amazingly brilliant movie
<START> if you speak french or can put up with sub titles you will really enjoy this movie if on the other hand you just want to see god's most beautiful creatures this is a must see not an ounce of <UNK> in sight <UNK> king eat your heart out sophie body is the epitome of perfection and everything i had ever <UNK> about her part is even in english even the fact that she was nude with john <UNK> did not detract for her beauty sophie is a ten if ever there was one <UNK> <UNK> and are 9 <UNK> oh yeah it is a pretty good story several little vignettes are woven together in a sort of six degrees of <UNK> style
<START> the most <UNK> man in ireland revolves around <UNK> who is 24 year old and still happens to be a virgin he lives with his mother in <UNK> he is also a very shy guy towards women everything has changes for when he is <UNK> by a woman as far as i can remember a <UNK> it is not because he <UNK> his virginity but he discovers that he has a super power despite having protection this <UNK> becomes pregnant he is told by the doctor that he has very high <UNK> count his mother brilliantly comes up with an idea which makes us see ginger headed babies all around in the end of the film he starts helping out women in both side of <UNK> to <UNK> babies first <UNK> then with the help of his colleague runs a business out of it the most <UNK> man in ireland has its funny moments but needed to come up with better jokes and with a better script i couldn't help thinking that it gave me the impression of a tv sitcom rather than a movie kris marshall is a different name on the silver screen but does not shine as star it's more like the guy you saw in such and such movie like him being in love actually i think he was very funny in that one well it was okay to watch but couldn't help <UNK> off from time to time out of
<START> boring cliched and predictable the only original bit was the <UNK> location for gangsters it is certainly no lock stock etc hannah was likeable in <UNK> doors in circus i developed no empathy with his character and couldn't give a toss what happened to either him or his girlfriend although this movie was so cliched and predictable the ending was no surprise i was so <UNK> i didn't even care why the movie was given the name circus <UNK> don't visit this big top
<START> aside from a few good moments of fairly raw violence this painful film is most notable for making <UNK> minutes seem like two hours br br it starts with an <UNK> long intro where the family is introduced including two <UNK> <UNK> and their adult brother and sister completely clich√©d <UNK> and ma and incredibly annoying grandpa played by charles <UNK> sales while sitting down to dinner the family is disturbed by the sounds of <UNK> and rushes to the window in time to see two men <UNK> down by <UNK> in the street the <UNK> flee through the family's house leaving them as witnesses to the crime br br the rest of the movie consists of walter huston as the <UNK> da occasionally <UNK> long anti crime speeches to make half hearted attempts at trying to protect the family from the mob it all winds up in a predictable manner br br good points about the movie include a couple of decent <UNK> and a truly nasty beating <UNK> <UNK> as one of the <UNK> and the gorgeous sue <UNK> in a small role as the daughter br br if you want to watch huston play his early trademark <UNK> <UNK> try <UNK> beast of the city avoid this one if at all possible
<START> rita hayworth plays a brooklyn nightclub dancer named rusty who <UNK> in <UNK> chorus <UNK> she manages to get herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine but her impending success as a solo with romantic offers all around has smitten boss gene kelly <UNK> at the bit terribly tired piece of technicolor <UNK> candy with <UNK> musical sketches the two worst of which are irrelevant flashbacks to the <UNK> with hayworth portraying her own grandmother kelly as always dances well but acts with false sincerity when he's serious he's <UNK> and the rest of the time he's flying on <UNK> the script is a lead weight not even giving supporting players phil <UNK> and eve <UNK> any good lines 1 2 from
<START> a day in the life of a <UNK> cab driver sometime around christmas the cab driver picks up a fare they have a <UNK> he drops off the fare he picks up another fare another <UNK> and so it goes on like this for 90 <UNK> minutes none of it convincing or interesting for even one minute skip it
<START> the worst film i have seen in the last 12 months the plot of the story was uninteresting the movie ended when he became khan i always thought there happened something really interesting afterwards i knew that <UNK> and all the areas where the movie played have beautiful landscapes but the movie didn't profit from that the jokes where really poor the narrator himself could have told a bit more about <UNK> history traditions etc my co viewer knew nothing about that at all so he was a bit lost i was so looking forward to see this film but was really disappointed after all it was one out of 3 movies i have ever seen in cinema where i considered to leave before the end
<START> saw this film the first time in 1953 with my older brother it was one of the great 3 films released in that era we saw it at least thirteen times and were proud of it scott does a typical western shoot em up job while surrounded by the indian <UNK> rather than surround sound oh for those <UNK> <UNK> again
<START> the film begins in <UNK> just after wwi being a history teacher i knew that <UNK> troops occupied much of russia during this time there was serious concern about the spread of <UNK> and the troops were there ostensibly to protect their <UNK> interests however some times they flew missions or had armed conflicts with the communist army as the nations involved really wanted to see the so called whites win however the whites were deeply some wanting the return of a <UNK> some wanting a republic and some wanting something in between because of these mixed goals and a lack of a real commitment by the foreign <UNK> the whole expedition was doomed and left the <UNK> after only a year or two however what i did not know was that german troops were also involved this surprised me as they had just lost wwi and weren't in the best shape to be <UNK> such an expedition br br this is the backdrop for the film but it's also about a pro communist rich lady and her ill <UNK> love for a childhood friend who is among the german troops she throws herself at him repeatedly but in each case he <UNK> her so she then these desires by various affairs while none of this sex is all that graphic this and the underlying reason the man isn't interested make this a rather adult film and one i wouldn't show to younger audiences br br while the setting for this film is interesting the overall film is as gray and lifeless as any i have seen i don't recommend it unless you are an amazingly patient person or you are really into overrated german films i especially warn away anyone who suffers with depression as it will no doubt make it worse the simple fact is that there are so many better german films out there waiting to be seen such as mostly martha <UNK> boot mother goes to heaven wings of desire or ali fear eats the soul among others
<START> well i must admit when i saw the trailer for this movie i was looking forward to it i am generally a fan of light hearted romantic comedies and from the trailer thats the impression i got of this movie however i spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin although there were a couple of amusing scenes in general the <UNK> of the movie was quite depressing br br i also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters as they all seemed a little underdeveloped the time which the director could have used exploring the characters taken up by a needless <UNK> of opera making the movie feel dragged out and slow br br all in all although there are some touching scenes the trailer is quite <UNK> and i would only suggest you go watch this if there is really nothing else that <UNK> your fancy br br not fantastic and as i have said before bland
<START> as i write this no user reviews are in yet but there are 17 votes with a 4 8 average so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments i didn't notice any and even if i had i don't think i could have stopped rolling my eyes for long enough to appreciate them br br a common debate among movie buffs is whether major mistakes in science police tactics and the like so common in b movies should detract significantly from one's enjoyment i tend to fall into the yes that's a reasonable reaction camp especially when the mistakes are central to the plot with this movie i look forward to reading how anyone can defend this mess they completely <UNK> pretty much every aspect of military tactics and <UNK> police tactics weapons science <UNK> common sense and human behavior outside of b movies that is in short i can't think of any non trivial thing they got right br br any movie would have its work cut out for it when its central premise is a supernatural spirit <UNK> to all small arms able to disappear into another dimension at will and yet apparently vulnerable to simply a bigger explosion they don't make ghosts like they used to combine this premise with every detail being wrong and you have a <UNK> bad movie
<START> being a d b <UNK> fan i've been on the <UNK> for this movie for quite some time i recently rented the video and found it very enjoyable it had some really hilarious scenes the dysfunctional lives of some of the characters was unsettling but i think the movie also showed that it's possible to keep your life on track or get it back on track if it's been <UNK>
<START> there are many distinct problems with the movie <UNK> for one there are way too many <UNK> the husband is a hunter and just happens to be hunting on the day that the main killer shows up with someone the killer knows okay i will take that one the kid calls the real estate agency that the wife works for and asks for money to be ready when he comes to get it okay i will take that one as well before he goes to get the cash he decided to rob our killer who doesn't kill him but decided to go with him on the job it's starting to get real weak then they show up on the same day that the husband has an interview with his wives boss no one is there but the wife and the husband who has decided to make his way into the empty office they make their way into the office and the professional killer just assumes that they are talking to the right guy that is just in the first 15 <UNK> br br there are a lot more holes in this movie then i care to talk about why the killer didn't just kill everyone at the real estate agency i don't know why he didn't shoot the woman on her <UNK> i don't know why he kept letting that dumb kid make all those stupid moves and mess a whole lot of crap up i don't know why the girlfriend was even in the movie i don't know why he decided not to pocket the gun and just leave it out on the counter i don't know why they even went into the witness protection program i don't know what i do know is that the casting director did a great job the director of photography did very good work the location <UNK> picked great locations and the production designer was worth every penny so my advice for anyone that is going to pick a script that is going to be so well worked by the crew make sure that every attempt to kill someone by the hit man is not <UNK> by a peak through an open window
<START> lovingly crafted and terribly interesting to watch <UNK> gritty breakthrough performance introducing a new kind of rebellious acting style that would carry over to the <UNK> and and so on after the war but all that <UNK> affection is a bit <UNK> <UNK> lane is a bright engaging performer but the other sisters don't really register though they're all allowed to be <UNK> and witty and i just had a hard time buying any of the other male characters besides garfield jeffrey <UNK> is a pleasant enough actor but he lacks the movie star weight to match up with <UNK> hard luck mickey <UNK> and that throws the film a bit out of <UNK> imagine a jimmy stewart or someone in the part also i was not convinced that garfield would make the pivotal to say the least final decision that he made the film needed another half hour of running time to better explain that action it feels awfully rushed and under motivated br br still it's not hard to understand how anybody who grew up with this picture would remember it <UNK> it falls short of being a classic but it does contain a few classic moments the two gate swinging scenes are pure movie magic
<START> very mild spoilers a basic plot outline no real details br br if you go into this movie with <UNK> low expectations i saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in <UNK> and the only reason i agreed to go was because it was free i expected a few chuckles but as i have never been a huge fan of <UNK> d not much more then that br br the first ten minutes of the film are hilarious as we are given a look at jack <UNK> humble christian origins in a <UNK> american town the film then takes us years into the future to the first meeting between <UNK> and kyle <UNK> the second half of <UNK> d we see the <UNK> of the band and the <UNK> of its name finally as the title suggests the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the <UNK> pick of destiny again the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face that said there were times it felt a bit long it's only 100 minutes but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter the story is every bit as absurd as it sounds and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot which is fine except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or miss and when they miss they miss bad same thing with the songs it is a musical but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so then kept going anyway br br i will say that the r rating really saved this movie from bombing the <UNK> humor simply couldn't work without <UNK> sex and drug references but unless you're a real fan of the band or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy i would recommend you save yourself some money and rent pick will make you giggle a bit but is it worth 9 bucks i don't think so i was tempted to rate it a 6 but since i do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres a 7 seems more appropriate just be sure it's your style
<START> i lay the blame for the <UNK> on anyone who enjoyed date movie and epic movie you people encouraged the fox studio to keep on <UNK> out desperate parody films and now we're faced with what just may be the <UNK> and most desperate one of them all the <UNK> barely qualifies as a parody heck it barely qualifies as a movie this is a comedy in theory but not in execution no one not even the people involved with this mess could have possibly fooled themselves into thinking they were making a funny movie director tom brady the hot chick has made something truly wretched here br br the plot if you can even call it that centers on a man named fields david <UNK> right when i heard his name within the first couple seconds of the film i knew i was in for a long movie funny names are seldom funny and become even less funny the more you hear them is one of the worst <UNK> in the world but he's been given another chance by his best friend <UNK> <UNK> carl to coach a <UNK> high school football team called the <UNK> must not only lead the team to victory but also teach them the ways of inspirational sports movie clich√©s he expects his kids to have poor <UNK> and problems with alcohol and <UNK> them when they don't when it looks like the team has a chance to play at the big championship toilet bowl game did 10 year olds write this script is shocked to discover that <UNK> is the coach of the big rival team that his team will be playing against turns out <UNK> only encouraged to take the <UNK> job because he wanted the <UNK> to lose br br the <UNK> is a movie so forced and pathetic i almost had a hard time believing what i was watching spoof movies have recently turned into a game of spot the movie reference and this continues the tradition it tries to squeeze in as many references to other sports movies as it can but it either does absolutely nothing with them expecting us to just point at the screen and laugh out of <UNK> or it attempts to be funny and falls flat on its face some of the films <UNK> include field of dreams bend it like beckham rocky <UNK> friday night lights stick it radio miracle remember the <UNK> <UNK> gang <UNK> and <UNK> a true underdog story but wait wasn't <UNK> already a parody of inspirational sports movies so in other words we're watching a parody of a parody of inspirational sports movies if that makes any sense to you you're just the audience this movie is looking for some of these films are <UNK> in the plot and some like the rocky one are just thrown in for no reason because the filmmakers wanted to try to reference as many films as possible there are some that the movie even feels the need to explain to us in its dialogue just in case we've missed the obvious reference you know a movie is in trouble when it has to spell out its own jokes to us br br the worst thing is that the screenplay by tv veterans and first time screen writers ed <UNK> and joey doesn't even know the first and most important rule of parody you have to play it straight the actors have to pretend they're not in on the joke the reason why the classic <UNK> brothers movies like airplane top secret and the naked gun are remembered so <UNK> is because they cast serious actors like leslie <UNK> yes he was a serious actor before he turned to comedy and robert stack and then threw them into ridiculous situations what made it funny is that they acted like they weren't in a comedy and kept a stone face to the weirdness around them those films wouldn't have worked if they played their roles <UNK> the <UNK> proves this as all the actors are forced to play their roles so goofy it's like they're screaming at us to laugh david <UNK> keeps on <UNK> his arms <UNK> his eyes and screaming at the top of his <UNK> to the point he looks like someone who knows he's trapped in a dead end comedy and just tries too hard to pretend he's having a good time the movie also doesn't understand the art of celebrity cameos also an important factor when it comes to parody films what kind of cameos do we get in the <UNK> andy dick and dennis <UNK> br br by the time the movie throws in an out of nowhere and extremely pointless cast musical number to <UNK> don't stop believing for absolutely no reason whatsoever i was just about ready to walk out the theater door i was the only person at my screening and the thought of this movie going on its pathetic way to a completely empty house kind of <UNK> to me i did sit through the rest of the <UNK> and i was not rewarded for my efforts the sad thing is fox is not yet done killing the spoof genre they have a parody of 300 coming out next year called meet the <UNK> i'd say it can't be much worse than this but i've seen the trailer and i wouldn't want to get your hopes up
<START> robert brutal quasi black comedy the <UNK> gang a <UNK> of the 1948 british film no <UNK> for miss has 1920s <UNK> kim <UNK> kidnapped by a pack of clumsy thieves soon that gang is <UNK> and poor kim is then transferred into the <UNK> of another crooked bunch third rate gangster brothers with <UNK> <UNK> faces and a mother who looks like buddy <UNK> in drag at first <UNK> not very <UNK> and not very smart attempts to escape this <UNK> <UNK> but they're onto her eventually she just gives up trying and <UNK> lies the trouble with the story are we in the audience supposed to sympathize with her is her growing concern for the family half wit supposed to be heartwarming these are disgusting <UNK> characters and i wanted to see as little of them as possible but since the side stories the progress of the cops on the case and another one involving <UNK> singer connie stevens are rather dull the director has no choice but to keep <UNK> those <UNK> faces on us pretty soon nervous <UNK> starts <UNK> too although her scene up in the is <UNK> performed and climactic moments are thought provoking if <UNK> from
<START> i gave this film a 2 mostly because it does actually have an ok cast but the film itself is just so insert unusually rude word beginning with the sixth letter of the <UNK> ing pointless that i felt bad that at the time i voted for it its lowest vote was a three br br very predictable plot two do well musicians have no money and plenty of money problems however when a friend leaves a bag full of money that belongs to drug dealers in their care they of course spend it and then the fun begins br br not an original idea in this whole film
<START> dracula 3000 is the epitome of painfully cheesy cinema from the get go i assumed i was in for something pretty nasty with a cast line up that featured casper van <UNK> erika <UNK> <UNK> and tiny <UNK> what could be expected well let's just say that expectations were crushed br br if i really start up i feel like this review will go on for ages so we're gonna keep this simple the vampire isn't even named dracula the space crew is carrying <UNK> from the <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> system in his big scene <UNK> speaks of the most horrible things ever spoken of in film history in the year 3000 everyone wears bad clothes by today's standards they don't have anything more advanced than a modern wheelchair and they <UNK> with <UNK> lights that appear stolen from a roller <UNK> br br to top it all off the ending sweet <UNK> god it doesn't deserve to be ruined it has to be <UNK> to be believed br br i've rated this movie a 1 and i wish i could give it a zero yet i feel compelled to make you watch it what madness is this
<START> the price of a dream and some dreams can be too expensive br br only having viewed the english translated version it is perhaps the reason for a low rating from this viewer br br it made the overall film <UNK> than the story material hinted at br br and other comments seem to suggest the subtitled version would be better br br but some plot elements remained unexplained leaving an unfinished feel br br it also leaves the thought is there a series to follow br br a pity there was no more at this stage at least anyway
<START> unusual film about a man who befriends his social opposite out of fear of blackmail peter boyle makes this film with his foul mouthed <UNK> portrayal of a working class stiff joe in love with the past and <UNK> of the future and worried about the present the first half hour of the show features the film debut of a young susan as melissa <UNK> a weak <UNK> rich girl who <UNK> with her loser boyfriend <UNK> with a full nude scene her boyfriend is the film's weak spot a poorly portrayed drug addict and dealer who meets his demise following <UNK> we meet <UNK> joe in a bar as he <UNK> off and <UNK> about <UNK> crime hippies and drugs and it is easy to see that the later norman <UNK> television character of <UNK> <UNK> is based on a <UNK> up version of joe the comparison even carries over into <UNK> wife and personal life and <UNK> joe <UNK> himself into the life of bill <UNK> <UNK> father and the two make an unlikely pair as they search for melissa who has run away from drug treatment and back to the drug <UNK> she calls friends their search leads them to an <UNK> gee as joe calls it a free love fest <UNK> by drugs a lot of nudity and surprisingly uptight bill <UNK> and ultra conservative joe both join in they get robbed and this leads to a violent and murderous ending that <UNK> the stark and chilling ending to taxi driver six years later joe is a funny film that on the surface at least is anti violence and anti racist yet the film's main character joe becomes the very <UNK> of the <UNK> he fears when he enters and joins in the illegal and <UNK> sexual <UNK> he <UNK> against so in that respect the film falls short of being a powerful message and leaves you wondering what the final outcome really was all about
<START> if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt mirrors eating non ants and <UNK> the world with a voice over narrative then this is the movie for you basically a couple of scientists working out of a bio <UNK> communicate with highly intelligent ants the most intelligent actors in this film in an attempt to try to <UNK> their plans of conquest and <UNK> throughout the movie the two scientists and a girl they rescued from the ants use everything at their <UNK> computers green <UNK> and horrid acting but to no <UNK> i guess they just couldn't afford any <UNK> because the movie would be over too quickly br br the title of the movie phase iv is something of a mystery this is not a spoiler but phase i starts right after the opening credits whereas you don't reach phase iv until the end credits roll apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed <UNK> 1 3 throughout the movie as a kind of progress report hang in there buddy only 1 more phase until final credits as a mst3k episode this one wasn't very good for two reasons 1 this one is from the season 0 on <UNK> when they were first starting out so the <UNK> is not as good as in later seasons and 2 this movie is so bad not even j <UNK> can <UNK> it up there are one or two gamera references as they had just finished <UNK> 5 gamera movies br br the movie does have a trick surprise ending but i was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me
<START> this is precious everything is <UNK> is <UNK> and <UNK> funny from the first delicious line of dialogue oh how i've been waiting for this to arrive in austin while <UNK> wood is charming as ever as jonathan <UNK> <UNK> the real life author of the novel everything is <UNK> it's eugene playing <UNK> <UNK> tour guide and <UNK> alex who truly steals this film alex is a hip hop <UNK> <UNK> break dancer who along with his grandfather helps jonathan find the woman who saved <UNK> <UNK> life during world war ii the <UNK> countryside has never looked so breath taking i'm thinking of <UNK> it all up and moving to the former soviet state br br the tone of the film however shifts when jonathan and alex do finally meet the woman they're looking for and suddenly this adorable comedy turns into a heart breaking historical drama about a jewish village that was <UNK> during the nazi <UNK> everything is <UNK> is about history <UNK> and the wisdom that can be gained from <UNK> the past it's perfect
<START> great movie <UNK> is by far the funniest character in a movie jennifer <UNK> <UNK> makes this movie even better well before <UNK> died <UNK> and him were together but like ten years later <UNK> gets <UNK> back as a doll and brings him back to life it was a great movie scary and <UNK> funny only because <UNK> 10 10
<START> here be spoilers br br <UNK> miller witnesses a robbery by <UNK> that goes wrong <UNK> partner get shot and killed but not until after he has <UNK> a great ruby and then meet at the cemetery when both try to get hold of the ruby unfortunately they are caught as grave robbers and sent to jail but not until has <UNK> the ruby the ruby is their key to freedom and once they're free they form a <UNK> in robbery is to pose as a gentleman and find out who is worth robbing and then simply they rob him and rob them in style but falls in love with the niece daughter of their first victim lady rebecca gibson tyler and a mr chance is out to catch them and his methods are not very nice br br comments a good action <UNK> by comedy and adventure <UNK> and miller form a good team with a lot of <UNK> and friendship and then there is the relationship between and rebecca gibson the scene with the ball is very good especially the <UNK> use of the music in addition to these interesting characters <UNK> play the best of them all lord rochester both the character and the acting are stellar and among the best in the movie in total the movie works very well a nice balance between story and special effects action and comedy very entertaining br br 8 10
<START> sometimes there's a film so bad that you just keep watching in awe this is one of those films of course i can't help that i'm biased i'm from chicago so i watched the scenes closely for accuracy and i don't find billy crystal funny at all and i can't stand all that english style photography tony scott etc with the smoke machine working <UNK> and all the soft lighting i suppose we're supposed to believe that billy crystal is really from chicago because he wears a <UNK> jersey oh and the plot if you really think about it these guys should be locked up not the bad guys since they're more dangerous and of course there's the clich√© of the cops on the verge of <UNK> but the funniest scene is the climax where the good and bad guys machine gun other to death in the thompson center a state building of course it's a cool building but it's the equivalent of making a huge drug deal at the white house
<START> i have some great memories watching robin of <UNK> on tv as a kid but i think i only saw michael episodes by some reason and recently my brother bought the new released dvd boxes of the complete series it was great to see it again and it is the best of all the robin hood movies and tv series the cast is great and the locations mixed with music adds this very special feeling i personally think that is the best of the two <UNK> but jason connery was a great choice to continue the series with ray <UNK> nicolas grace and robert is terrific in their roles as will scarlet the sheriff of <UNK> and guy of it¬¥s a pity that a fourth season never got made and <UNK> also heard that the writer richard carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series robert of <UNK> connery could finally have married marion <UNK> or maybe the hunter could <UNK> robin of and he could take his revenge against the sheriff as have been mentioned before if the producers of robin hood the prince of thieves would have been smart they would have got the cast from robin of <UNK> and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series as ray <UNK> puts it in the dvd it would have been great to see them as old men just like in sean robin and <UNK> who knows maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future in any case we can now watch our favorite series over and over again

<START> between the ages of 30 and <UNK> when he died of a brain <UNK> <UNK> scott made 70 films he was introduced in 1944 in jean 'the mask of where he played the next year 1945 he made three films of which this is one he is best remembered by <UNK> as the star of jean <UNK> 'the one of the 1945 films where he had a sympathetic role however he often played creepy characters and in this film he is a <UNK> killer of women for money so what happens here he lives in a house with three women so watch out faye <UNK> who also appeared in plays the older of two daughters in the house she falls in love with scott and they become secretly engaged then her <UNK> younger sister played effectively by <UNK> freeman who resembles <UNK> <UNK> both in looks and in behaviour returns from <UNK> school and reveals casually in conversation with scott that she has inherited a <UNK> sum so scott turns his sights on her instead with all the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the household which that was bound to <UNK> things get tense and then they get meanwhile plans for murder are going forward in the mind of the <UNK> scott but it turns out that he is not the only one with such intentions he is also being searched for as a result of his last kill with which the film has opened so that we know his back story james wong <UNK> gives effective <UNK> cinematography to this tale which was directed by frenchman robert <UNK> who had moved to hollywood some time earlier the film is an effective psychopath in the house mystery which can cause a bit of wear of the edges of some seats for those of such an <UNK>
<START> this is the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life period this movie goes beyond ridiculous it is like the director wants to get his ass <UNK> by the actors for <UNK> their roles as the fantastic four i believe the movie should have been released in comic book stores in order for the only how u should say it desperate <UNK> who cant get enough cheesiness and want to see more and more crap movies in conclusion to my <UNK> statements and <UNK> i do believe this movie has had great <UNK> to the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> with the exception of jay <UNK> character in which i do believe it was his best performance considering roles such as the not quite human movies in which the story is told in a way that he has no character he cant act and people have made good decisions to not go see his movies this is why he is most likely not going to be any huge roles unless he sparks his career in a most rare but interesting way
<START> it was september 2003 that i heard the bbc were going to <UNK> doctor who and make it bigger and better but i'd heard these <UNK> in the press before and thought that's all they were <UNK> but it was then mentioned that russell t davies was going to produce and write the show and then one saturday afternoon in march 2004 channel 4 news interviewed the actor cast in the title role christopher <UNK> yes that christopher <UNK> an actor i've always been impressed by since watching his film debut in let him have it and if he was getting interviewed on television it must have been true as the months passed more and more information was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was being cast the <UNK> would be returning and the mill the hollywood effects company who had done the fx for gladiator were <UNK> to do the special effects for the show for several weeks before the first broadcast trailers <UNK> <UNK> the return of the new series massive <UNK> in london informed the public about the return of the show <UNK> <UNK> carried massive photo <UNK> of the aliens appearing and christopher <UNK> appeared on <UNK> as diverse as blue peter mastermind which had a special doctor who night edition this morning and friday night with <UNK> ross in fact this new series of doctor who must have been the most hyped programme in the history of british television it had better be bloody good br br so was it bloody good undoubtedly it has been a major success with nearly every episode making the top ten shows in the tv <UNK> to give you clue of its rating success only one episode the <UNK> in space episode two <UNK> 1975 from the old series had made it into the top five tv <UNK> the opening series episode made number three with two more episodes either beating or <UNK> the previous record and this is in an era where there's far more competition in terms of tv stations and choice let's laugh and cheer at the fact doctor who stuffed hit me baby one more time celebrity wrestling and <UNK> <UNK> and saturday night <UNK> of course much of the success is down to the breath taking visuals and the casting of a well known <UNK> actor in the role for the most part everything you see on screen here equals anything you'll see in a spielberg hollywood movie there's a <UNK> invasion force <UNK> <UNK> of thousands exotic aliens a 19th century <UNK> that looks like a 19th century <UNK> and night filming that is actually night filming and not done by sticking a dark <UNK> over the screen i promise you'll be hearing a lot more from the directors who worked on this series joe especially will one day be in the hollywood a list br br there are some flaws to the new series of doctor who and all of them should be laid at the door of russell t davies it may be <UNK> whether the soap opera and post <UNK> elements are successful or not in my opinion they're not but what's not in <UNK> is that the weakest scripts are all written by <UNK> as i mentioned in my review of <UNK> he <UNK> the audience and he does the same thing here when faced by armed soldiers pointing their guns at him the doctor <UNK> attack plan <UNK> which makes no sense to anyone in the audience but allows him to escape from a tight spot a naked captain jack suddenly pulls out a laser he's been hiding and <UNK> scripts are full of these type of <UNK> and <UNK> ex <UNK> type endings in fact the final episode is spoiled greatly by the ridiculous concept of what the bad wolf is which seems to have got <UNK> out of a tight spot more than the doctor and of the endings i'm trying to remember if any of them were actually down to the doctor more often than it's a supporting character or the doctor's companion who saves the day the show is called doctor who not rose tyler so can we see the title character save the day please just like he did in the classic series one final point about the portrayal of the doctor is the way he's written as a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is best known for his serious and gloomy roles and he's absolutely breath taking at scenes when he's showing grief like the tear running down his face in the end of the world but more often than not he's written as a tom baker on speed character it's obvious why <UNK> hasn't done much comedy in his career he's not very good at it br br am i starting to sound like i hate this show sorry i didn't mean to but it's just that while some have been met or <UNK> some others haven't and they're nearly all down to russell t davies who thankfully is <UNK> less in the way of scripts in the next series of doctor who let's see more traditional stories of a human <UNK> being under threat from monsters like we saw in the 1960s and 70s imagine a story like the sea <UNK> with a massive budget directed by joe oh and one last request can we see these next time trailers <UNK> they reveal all the best bits of next <UNK> episode
<START> heart of darkness was terrible the novel was difficult enough to understand but when a production company decides to release a film loosely based on it then that just <UNK> everyone up not only did those in charge decide to change certain characters and completely eliminate others but the acting was horrid and the overall impression i got from the movie was that it was a complete dud i watched the film in hopes of understanding the novel a bit better but it just threw me and my fellow classmates off completely i think the movie was a waste of time and i was disappointed to see tim roth in such a disappointing film especially when he has awesome flicks like pulp fiction and dogs under his belt same with the very cool john <UNK>
<START> the grudge 2 is one of the films that makes me wish there were more <UNK> for terrible in the english language with a plot <UNK> with more holes than a net this film fails to make <UNK> viewing for a fan of even the most inane films which i am i felt compelled to remain in the cinema until i had <UNK> <UNK> worth of entertainment from it though i feared that i would be there for some years a better film could be made from the out takes of the first installment of the grudge though i am not altogether sure this isn't the result of such an exercise as expected what passes for a plot in this dire example of wasted celluloid finishes with no resolution whatsoever thereby leaving the producers with the option of <UNK> 'the grudge <UNK> upon the public when the time comes that they feel yet another <UNK> of true hatred for <UNK>
<START> now i loved lethal weapon and kiss kiss bang bang but i cannot believe <UNK> black wrote this pile or that david morse and john c <UNK> are in it i screened it for a film festival awful everyone was laughing it's preachy and heavy handed not to mention stupid also it's surprising how little l a looks like cambodia the entire idea of time traveling through post traumatic stress disorder is kinda dumb imagine born on the fourth of july mixed with the <UNK> effect 2 i used to sequel as the example to really show how bad this movie is but directed by michael <UNK> 2nd unit director that bad the 2 stars are purely based on the production value
<START> in <UNK> the young couple <UNK> t and boris are in deep love for each other with the world war ii boris <UNK> to join the army and is sent to the front on the day before birthday and they do not have the chance to say goodbye to each other while waiting for news from boris <UNK> is raped by <UNK> cousin mark a and they marry each other however <UNK> does not forget boris and keeps waiting for him br br is an impressive and heartbreaking romance in times of war the direction is excellent and uses <UNK> along the story <UNK> in the capital scene when <UNK> is raped by mark the camera work is amazing with sophisticated planes and angles and long traveling the scenes of <UNK> in the middle of the tanks or in the train station with many are awesome the magnificent cinematography is <UNK> by the restored image of the dvd t has an extremely beautiful face and a touching and sensitive performance the speech in the last scene makes another great example of an anti war movie my vote is nine br br title brazil as when fly the <UNK>
<START> i just don't get these reviews i can't help thinking they are written by the sort of l o g fan who would worship anything they ever do without questioning whether it is actually any good br br i'm a massive fan of the programme but thought this film was a pointless project i could forgive the ridiculous plot if i had come out of the cinema having laughed more than twice at one point i thought it might just me before i realised hardly any laughs were from the rest of audience br br i wasn't expecting much of a plot very few tv comedies stand up to being stretched over 90 minutes but thought the odd bit of classic l o g dialogue or visual joke like at the start of each programme would carry a film after 5 minutes of the <UNK> century plot i was begging for it to end little did i know it would carry on for the rest of the film it just wasn't funny br br i was just <UNK> disappointed and can't see history being too kind to it even if a few die hard fans write enthusiastic reviews
<START> this is probably the best movie of 2002 regarding romanian cinema i do recommend it being an intense drama with no lack of action and thrills the movie concentrates upon teen life in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the main character not focusing so much on the character's shape or definition but more on the anger that he and other characters feel the title <UNK> means rage rather than anger but could be regarded in the movie in both senses from the behavior of actors the rather odd love story not a typical romantic one but rather a modern suburban conception is well shaped towards the end it is a captivating picture and cinematography is pretty good in catching the suburban night life thus making it a nice movie to watch and br br you won't get bored for a minute i promise
<START> my wife and i watched this movie because we plan to visit <UNK> and <UNK> soon fortunately or unfortunately the landscape and <UNK> complete with <UNK> are the only believable members of this cast we expected reasonable well written and well acted movie but were disappointed its only redeeming grace is an extended and remarkable fishing sequence full of authenticity <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wooden <UNK> with long and passionate if <UNK> <UNK> br br the movie's <UNK> is <UNK> its dialogue stilted and the acting <UNK> from stiff to completely over the top one scene in which bergman <UNK> out as her macho native and <UNK> husband <UNK> his <UNK> on an innocent but apparently already deceased rabbit would be perfect <UNK> for a monty python skit br br when the <UNK> blew we hoped for a <UNK> end to the suffering <UNK> and the <UNK> unfortunately the movie continues to <UNK> on <UNK> finally to a melodramatic and absurd ending unless you're really into old time <UNK> fishing pass this hokey effort by
<START> tv <UNK> out dozens of true crime movies every year you can see 3 or 4 every saturday on lifetime and court tv can be relied on for a few every weekend so i started watching the <UNK> murders thinking i knew very well what to expect a more or less competent retelling of a real life family murder what i got was a subtle beautifully acted drama that <UNK> me from start to finish br br both the brothers were totally convincing and jonathan was perfect in the challenging role of luke the look and feel of georgia was in almost every frame if i had any complaint it was gordon as the sheriff he just doesn't look or act like a small town southern <UNK> named byron <UNK> he looks and sounds like and is not right for this part br br but this is a minor <UNK> the <UNK> murders is well worth watching and not just on a rainy saturday afternoon if you're going out tape it you won't regret it
<START> most of the positive comments posted here are as <UNK> as the movie it takes a long <UNK> bore to appreciate a <UNK> and boring film one <UNK> some have merely called the film <UNK> meaning slow and devoid of plot however one dutch reviewer hit the nail on the head this is an important event turned into a dull film whose tone is set in the very first scene here a young couple is being shown an apartment by a <UNK> who predictably talks non stop and regardless of what else is going on so does just about every other character br br the only <UNK> in this picture are dream sequences 1930's soviet propaganda snippets and they are also its most interesting parts this tells you something about how watchable the rest of the movie is br br the device of filming most of the scenes in extreme <UNK> as if one were looking through a crack in the <UNK> gets old fast
<START> in this film the <UNK> sent to explore a newly discovered planet must deal with several <UNK> and they do so intelligently the film approaches it's main plot theme in a unique way and unfolds it gradually though it can be guessed beforehand br br the acting is very good though sometimes stiff as some late 60s acting can be it can also be somewhat <UNK> and even melodramatic especially after the plot theme reveals itself visually it has a scene that resembles one in the previous year's 2001 a space odyssey and that tends to date the movie some of the actors went on to star in the 1970 tv show <UNK> which is delightfully campy and worth checking out on dvd br br despite these small points the space flight itself is realistic and considering this was 1969 the scenes inside the <UNK> of the <UNK> also had a realistic look look for some 1990s <UNK> video technology in use too one thing i suspect a love scene has been cut but i can't prove it it would have been a distraction anyway br br unlike most sci fi films this film will make you think about the plot and that's well worth a look i'm pleased to have this film in my video library
<START> please people do not bother with this poorly directed joke the direction was totally wrong from the outset where is the history of his <UNK> emotional <UNK> and the general madness in the original family why is ed portrayed as this large overbearing <UNK> figure full of anger and hate what is this crap the writer and director obviously did no research into the history and just wanted to cash in on the infamous <UNK> name the fools who made this movie took so many liberties with the truth it's ridiculous if you want t see a brilliant <UNK> film go back to the minor classic deranged to see how ed really was there is humor in that film and ed is portrayed as more of the sad lonely slight man he was according to history where is the background story here there is just poorly set up shocks that are not shocking that we've seen before and more accomplished as well take the worst texas chainsaw massacre ripoff and add this one to that list had to give it one out of ten because rating wouldn't accept zero i want my money back if anyone regards this film as is possibly getting a financial to do so
<START> i know that to include everything in the book the film would have to have been several hours long so i think they did their best to include things that were crucial and pivotal to the story i thought the casting was great the children who played <UNK> and <UNK> were very good actors and the guy who played <UNK> as an adult was great the scenes between him and <UNK> were especially touching i thought the locations they used were interesting scenes set in afghanistan were shot in china and one scene that took place in <UNK> the <UNK> scene was actually shot on treasure island in san francisco i worked one day as an extra on <UNK> runner and it was that day the day they shot the <UNK> scene we reported to treasure island in the morning they checked everyone's wardrobe to make sure it looked like the late 80s an then we took our places in the audience they shot the scene over and over again until they were happy with it it was cool to see the actors up close and also to see the <UNK> author who was on hand as a story <UNK> i thought this book was excellent and i recommend both the book and the movie to anyone this is a moving story about friendship love guilt and eventual redemption there is a way to be good again
<START> or at least you feel pretty high after this movie it's the kind of film that the word <UNK> really can be applied to though it's <UNK> in that entirely casual intelligent and open minded way that belongs to the french br br no catherine <UNK> does not spend the entire movie high sorry to disappoint any <UNK> with an agenda but the one scene to which i refer involves all the members of a wedding party and it's a musical number anyway everything fits pretty <UNK> together and the unusual bright colorful family <UNK> mother is a lesbian <UNK> her bon <UNK> daughter alternately entertain and annoy us as real families do but since it's a movie they mostly entertain br br don't want to say too much about the ending but <UNK> ends up marrying a man about twenty years younger this is entirely believable as we see the relationship develop over time and as the two are naturally drawn closer and closer together the ending is a happy one and like the rest of the movie <UNK> quirky as well as pitch perfect
<START> for anyone who cares to know something about the real diane <UNK> or who values psychological <UNK> this film is abysmal <UNK> was a brilliant talented restless and troubled person but this film depicts her as completely self involved and truly bizarre in her taste and judgment kidman portrays her as wan and vague whereas she was someone who knocked people over with her charisma the totally fictional relationship that is central to the film is quite unbelievable and robert downey is truly annoying in his <UNK> portrayal of someone who seems to think he's superior to the rest of the world simply because of his <UNK> the film depicts this encounter as being the source of interest in freaks which is a truly banal explanation for the inspiration behind some of the greatest photographs of the 20th century the mystery to me is why people of some talent and intelligence chose to be involved with this film in any way
<START> while it may not be his most laugh packed film mighty like a <UNK> stands as one of <UNK> <UNK> most satisfying farce comedies twenty minutes of clever sight gags nicely choreographed physical comedy and amusing <UNK> rendered via title card of course all based on a wacky and wildly implausible premise we're told up top that this is a story of <UNK> people a wife with a face that would stop a clock and her husband with a face that would start it again soon we meet buck <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his wife <UNK> who has an enormous nose but there's no point in discussing <UNK> when our plot <UNK> on such a <UNK> unbelievable series of <UNK> <UNK> i e first that <UNK> would have his <UNK> <UNK> the very day his wife would have her nose fixed second that each <UNK> would keep their respective <UNK> <UNK> secret from the other and third that when <UNK> into each other in public afterward <UNK> and <UNK> wouldn't recognize each other sounds like a bit of a stretch doesn't it multiple stretches is more like it clearly we're in the world of farce here and just have to roll with the silly plot twists so as long as you can relax and forget about <UNK> you're likely to enjoy this short br br mighty like a <UNK> gets off to a <UNK> start as the various complications of the story are established but things pick up once <UNK> and <UNK> have met and made a date to attend a party together at the home of dentist they each rush home <UNK> enter <UNK> and are at first unaware of each other's presence mr mrs <UNK> appear to be quite wealthy incidentally as they live in a mansion the size of a luxury hotel there follows a beautifully timed sequence somewhat reminiscent of buster keaton's the <UNK> in which husband and wife dash about the house without ever quite meeting up face to face and once they arrive at the party the comedy really kicks into high gear as <UNK> is forced to dance with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> henry henry an <UNK> player in her own right who starred in many short comedies dating back to <UNK> is hilarious as the dance partner who brings great <UNK> but little grace to her dancing there's also an elegant cinematic touch during this sequence when the camera pans down to show us only the shoes of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and dance partner yet we're able to follow precisely what's happening between the principles by watching their feet br br unfortunately for <UNK> and <UNK> the party they're attending is <UNK> and from there on the complications <UNK> when they manage to escape the police <UNK> and return home when <UNK> realizes that his newly wife was attempting to step out with another man he <UNK> to each her a lesson while conveniently forgetting of course that he was attempting to do the very same thing the last few minutes of this film offer some of <UNK> funniest physical comedy <UNK> with a good sight gag for the punchline mighty like a <UNK> leaves the viewer with a warm glow and surely ranks with the most amusing comedies produced by the prolific sadly underrated <UNK> chase
<START> old bat transforms to younger ok looking girl after drinking a <UNK> this movie was dreadful the acting atrocious the camera work made me head spin and it features the longest most excruciatingly boring strip <UNK> ever put to film <UNK> should be ashamed for directing this <UNK> been <UNK> just for writing something so awful don't rent this movie the only exception i can this of is maybe if you're dying and only have less then 90 minutes to live watch this film cause it will feel like an eternity and you'll be begging the grip <UNK> come a little early br br my grade f
<START> when i first saw this i thought bits of it were fairly scary but the horror is a little <UNK> by the fact that the teenagers are so irritating that you don't really care what happens to them there are some genuinely good moments such as <UNK> speech about demons and the briefly seen demon itself is effective but this really doesn't stand up to repeated viewing or close analysis it's all pretty tacky and cheap looking and often downright silly pornography and unfunny <UNK> all too often replacing horror the music is excellent however and the <UNK> is certainly amusing but this film <UNK> have much to recommend it just comes across as another jason type stalk and slash fare
<START> <UNK> power was cast in the lead as <UNK> however part way through the film he died unexpectedly the studio chose to cast <UNK> <UNK> in the lead and re shoot the scenes that power had done in <UNK> considering how awful this film was power was lucky as this would have been a horrible way to end his lovely film career br br of all the biblical epics i have seen this one is by far the worst and that's saying a lot because hollywood has made many dull biblical tales so many you wonder if the creation of these films was an <UNK> conspiracy in fact the film was so dull that it deservedly was included in harry brilliant book the fifty worst movies of all time there are so many reasons to hate the film but the worst is how incredibly <UNK> the whole thing was sure casting people with italian eastern european scottish and english accents to play <UNK> and <UNK> was pretty bad but at least this made the film oddly humorous having <UNK> gina <UNK> playing the role of a woman <UNK> to have come from a place around <UNK> was also just awful but at least she was beautiful even if she couldn't act having an overweight and post middle aged george sanders play such a young role was also pretty bad but at least he had a pretty voice creating an orgy scene that was choreographed and <UNK> dull was pretty bad but at least you got to see in the credits a mention of a person as the orgy choreographer no the worse thing about this movie is that almost two and a half hours it seemed like nine it was so poorly paced and insipid considering that the only mention of this queen of <UNK> and <UNK> is only in a few <UNK> <UNK> in the old testament it's amazing the film just went on and on and on the greatest story ever told was a bit longer but that movie was based on four <UNK> not a dozen or so <UNK> br br the bottom line is that the film is wretched in practically every way except for <UNK> <UNK> even for devoted christians and jews this is a must avoid film because it plays so fast and loose with the truth as well as <UNK> an amazing amount of sex into a biblical film terrible in almost every way it is truly a <UNK> for <UNK> power that he's not remembered for starring in this <UNK> turkey
<START> the few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a <UNK> boy <UNK> <UNK> meandering <UNK> between swimming holes when <UNK> or please god palance try their hand at fiery <UNK> they sound like <UNK> <UNK> a bug the displays of <UNK> brilliance <UNK> a map of cuba <UNK> with smiling in the ocean and a positively <UNK> <UNK> on how the bay of pigs came to pass what does that leave us with one comical <UNK> scene a <UNK> of <UNK> hollywood <UNK> who address the camera as though it were a moving train and just for kicks a of <UNK> that is not limited to <UNK> manic and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> never trust a <UNK> but even a <UNK> clock is right twice a day this is a historically awful movie
<START> as a fan of <UNK> <UNK> since college i was especially pleased to see intruder in the dust and for other reasons my grandfather also named clarence brown as was the director grew up in the <UNK> area having been born near there in <UNK> we attended a week long family reunion at <UNK> in july 1964 a mere 15 years after filming the movie it still looked mostly like it does in the film but was going thru a period of civil rights <UNK> then as the site of <UNK> miss my <UNK> is of its being a nice little college town that summer but i was just an 18 year old college <UNK> and white i was just then beginning to see the injustice of <UNK> and prejudice but still had a long way to go anyhow the movie is well worth watching but the filmmakers must have had to walk a tight rope to get it done there and i would love to know more about that story br br now days <UNK> is a larger more modern college town with all the <UNK> that go along with such things and i hope to return again to see how it must have changed socially in the last 40 plus years <UNK> should certainly have been nominated for an oscar that year but hollywood was still to <UNK> itself to let that happen other <UNK> stories have been filmed so look for them and compare one of the best was a <UNK> treatment of the <UNK> <UNK> from about 1985 or so starring tommy lee jones it really captured the intensity of rural southern whites that <UNK> wrote so <UNK> about so often
<START> <UNK> meteor i seen this referred to as authentic and a gem i caught this movie on a saturday afternoon i kinda wished that i didn't br br apparently this was noted as being mike <UNK> first dramatic role unfortunately it had to be this movie the first thing you'll notice that <UNK> meteor suffers from is a complete lack of plot or rather a bunch of little subplots that aren't really connected and don't go anywhere young orphan mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with their grandmother a <UNK> lands in their garden and is eventually <UNK> by a scientist named hugh despite the title of the movie mickey is the one who lays claim to the meteor and the storyline actually has little to do with the meteor in any shape or form from here on out several other characters and subplots are introduced but like i said before they don't really go anywhere br br things go from cute family movie to dark thriller pretty fast when pete mike myers is introduced and starts to play a role <UNK> blames him for the death of his parents though we're never really told what happened or why hugh has romance problems because his girlfriend can't get past his <UNK> fascination and <UNK> drug related past starts to catch up with him and <UNK> draws his own girlfriend and the rest of the cast into the mix when shady characters start trying to kill him this would seem to be the main plot until you realize it doesn't even have a role until halfway through the film making everything else feel like pointless filler <UNK> girl problems bad behavior the meteor what on earth do they have to do with this not much br br so the <UNK> is disjointed and half of it is pointless but a good cast of characters can save it right <UNK> good the majority of characters are terribly unlikable people most of which you'd like to see die horribly at least i know i would despite the title mickey seems to be the main character which is a really bad move once you see him in action he is one of the worst little kids i've seen in a movie with an extremely bad attitude problem he a car <UNK> and talks trash to hugh an adult for taking the meteor actually attempts burn the man's house down when he doesn't get his way and even tries to stab pete with a knife you'd think a kid like this is on his way to the jail house unfortunately one of the worst things about this movie is that mickey never gets what's coming to him i'm not sure at what point you're supposed to be <UNK> with his character because he's always a nasty little brat he's the <UNK> for his brother and sister so they predictably end up taking and <UNK> and just following whatever he does amazingly they're pushed back so far that i can't even remember their names they might as well not even be there br br their grandmother is pretty much a borderline alcoholic she tends to be just as nasty to hugh as mickey and likes to push people out of her house and give them evil <UNK> when she's not down <UNK> <UNK> and drinking herself silly pretty ridiculous when you take into account that she's supposed to be taking care of three children her issues with alcohol are never really addressed though she does collapse from time to time in the movie br br hugh is one of the few likable characters in the movie but that's only because he's the <UNK> bag for the majority of characters and takes their mess without giving it back the kids treat him but he always comes back and tries to teach them and do nice things with them he's got a taxi driver girlfriend who seems to take every aspect of his life as a scientist as a personal offense attempting to leave him several times in the movie when he goes off into his <UNK> <UNK> or does something to prove that he isn't exactly on the same <UNK> as the rest of the characters thankfully br br then there's mike myers as pete pete despite having the only solid purpose and plot in the movie is extremely underused and doesn't play any kind of role until the second half it's unfortunate that myers got stuck in such a position for a dramatic role even when pete is getting screen time half of it is just myers running through dark <UNK> and hiding in small <UNK> and even though he was the only real point to this movie when his plot line brings the movie to a close it's a strange <UNK> conclusion that has all the characters laughing on a good note with a quick and strange explanation behind the title of the movie making you wonder if they were just performing in the movie you were just watching br br the only thing worth seeing in <UNK> meteor is mike <UNK> role as pete and that's if you can <UNK> through this disjointed mess long enough without <UNK> out at another human being due to the extremely unlikable characters and nonexistent plot line no sir i didn't like this one at all
<START> a tale of a young boy <UNK> joseph with aids who befriends a rough and <UNK> boy played by brad his exact opposite the cure is sad if a bit too <UNK> pull at your emotions message movie with it's heart in the right place for that fact alone it's a recommended view the highlight might be just watching them finding friendship and hanging out with each other when no one else accepts them br br however since the real story centers on the boy's aids things take off when one day at the local supermarket <UNK> eye catches a <UNK> <UNK> magazine that states a new orleans doctor has discovered the cure both of them obviously a tad naive make it a plan to set out for new orleans in <UNK> means possible which kinda pulled me two ways it's a <UNK> heart warming and i hate to <UNK> pick but i found the plot wanders in a melodramatic predictable sense and the proceedings have a coat of <UNK> over them like only movies can do i couldn't escape the <UNK> notion i was watching a road trip movie about self discovery sickness and growing up for instance i know they're young but i found it a real task to belief in the things these boys do like <UNK> tree leaves and drinking the hot or eating an experimental <UNK> of chocolate bars because they believe it will combat the <UNK> disease to say nothing of them making a cross country voyage as they do with no legal or downright scary <UNK> still <UNK> aside those movie conventions you come to expect it's a story worth seeing particularly with family
<START> an <UNK> neglected classic intruder in the dust is one of the great films of the 1940's which has unfortunately slipped into obscurity based on a story by william and shot in his hometown of <UNK> <UNK> intruder tells the story of lucas played with great dignity by <UNK> a black man <UNK> accused of the murder of a local white man and a white boy claude <UNK> jr who uses this situation as an opportunity to pay a previous debt to terrific acting especially by two great character actors porter hall as the dead man's father and elizabeth <UNK> best known as mrs on i love lucy as an old woman willing to stand against the <UNK> to see that right is done this straightforward tense and sincere study of racial <UNK> deserves to be seen more
<START> i bought this chuck norris dvd knowing that it was one of his earliest films and it shows we all know that he will never win an oscar for his acting but that's not what we watch him for although there have been a few <UNK> in california since this movie was made there never was any desert or hills between <UNK> 99 and i 5 billy was supposedly crossing over from 99 to 5 along <UNK> a distance of less that 15 miles i wish that the writers producers and directors of these movies would at least look at a map as a truck driver who spends a lot of time in california i could tell right from the start that the <UNK> was wrong however there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half so grab your <UNK> and an adult <UNK> and enjoy a trip back in time
<START> i loved it in fact i watched it over and over and over and i could watch it again this movie doesn't get boring br br the vampire concept is <UNK> in this movie it's a job well done great for today's generation br br wesley snipes was born for this role stephen <UNK> was an ideal vampire <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has <UNK> provides great comical relief br br this vampire movie is like no other i can't wait for blade 2
<START> i saw this movie unfortunately because it was the only option at that time and because david <UNK> was the director i saw his previous naked gun both parts airplane and top secret and i liked at least i had a good time and laughed i'm not saying that the movies i mentioned were master pieces but were ok i don't recall any other more stupid movie than this it's incredible how hollywood industry is in total <UNK> if some studio spends any money to produce this awful picture then is not a surprise that this kind of <UNK> are more common on these days this is a clear reflect of a <UNK> civilization where sex symbols and stupid plots are produced to entertain the common people i don't have any good to say about this film if you are planning to rent it or buy it please don't waste your money or your time avoid it no matter what even if you are fan of one of the actors does not worth it in fact this could be a very good example of what a director should avoid i won't see a <UNK> movie again he is planning to direct the fourth sequel of scary movie imagine that pathetic awful
<START> taylor mrs drake english 10 <UNK> <UNK> march <UNK> br br a shot in the dark br br it is difficult to make it through the movie heart of darkness because it is incredibly <UNK> the book that this movie is based off of has little action to begin with so the thought of turning it into a movie seems like a totally off handed idea anyways basically <UNK> a fail br br most of the book is of the mental travel of a young <UNK> named <UNK> on a job through the many of the <UNK> and people as a feel like the screenwriter failed <UNK> at capturing the essence of <UNK> travels it totally missed the biggest issue of light versus dark that is the major point in the book and when that doesn't translate to the movie all that's left is 100 minutes of boredom and <UNK> br br this being the case the question is <UNK> why would anyone make this into a movie an even better question could then be asked who would want to watch it it is utterly a chore to watch had it not contributed to a grade in my english class i would have never even considered watching the movie i would never recommend this movie to anyone heart of darkness is stripped of all its insight and meaning when it's taken from the pages of the book the <UNK> is torture to read until the last twenty pages or so but the <UNK> is that it is a pretty decent book the movie is like a shot in the dark with no chance in the world of hitting its target br br how can a book that's all about the mental <UNK> and <UNK> of darkness be portrayed in a physical visual sense i feel like it's impossible to accurately show thoughts also i feel like the time difference between the book and the movie creates major points that don't seem to add up at all the <UNK> heart of darkness was published in <UNK> while the movie version of heart of darkness is from 1993 the <UNK> years between the two may be a reason behind the seemingly different the <UNK> seems to have much <UNK> conditions and the movie does not portray the <UNK> feel of the <UNK> the <UNK> in the movie just seems like another place not the dark <UNK> place that the book paints this setting of i feel like this <UNK> another major element that really contributes to the <UNK> br br with two of the biggest aspects of the storyline missing in the movie the little bit of decency that is in the book heart of darkness is gone when the controversy of light versus dark is the biggest theme not including it in the movie makes it seem like the entire movie will be incredibly it is it's dull <UNK> and a major waste of time there's no reason to watch it the book is stripped of any significance it has if it's necessary for some reason read the book avoid the movie at all costs br br cast and credits <UNK> tim roth <UNK> john <UNK> the russian <UNK> the intended <UNK> <UNK> br br directed by nicolas <UNK> written by <UNK> fitzgerald based on the <UNK> by joseph conrad running time 100 minutes rated pg 13 some sexuality and language
<START> i turned over to this film in the middle of the night and very nearly <UNK> right passed it it was only because there was nothing else on that i decided to watch it in the end i thought it was great br br an interesting storyline good characters a clever script and brilliant directing makes this a fine film to sit down and watch this was in fact the first i'd heard of this movie but i would have been happy to have paid money to see this at the cinema br br my imdb rating 8 out of 10 br br
<START> some friends recommended this but as a film it's really lacking in originality i found the characters to be <UNK> stereotypes and the plot is predictable almost from the beginning however if you like traditional english <UNK> <UNK> it will keep your interest long enough to hear the next one i've also read that the soundtrack is nothing like the music in the movie with professional musicians filling in for the actors
<START> <UNK> cruelty has to be one of the most disturbing films i've ever seen <UNK> and cannibal holocaust didn't bother me that much but there's a strange psychological element to <UNK> cruelty this film <UNK> your <UNK> mind with shocking <UNK> <UNK> visuals and one of the most unsettling film scores and sound designs repulsive at times yes but its visual flair can be compared to avant <UNK> directors such as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and david lynch take the most extreme elements of those 4 directors and throw in the graphic violence of a film by fulci and you might be able to guess what you're in for br br the film is divided into 4 parts the first part the eye is real short a narrator tells us about the the parts of the brain and its functions then a nude woman gets her stomach cut open and an <UNK> is pulled out the second part human <UNK> is kind of like the film <UNK> but with incest it deals with a man's sexual obsession with his pregnant sister where's when you need him the third part is my absolute favorite it reminds me of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> 1972 short film in this segment people have sex with the earth men <UNK> bloody holes in the ground girls <UNK> with tree <UNK> the <UNK> bleed when broken watch in horror as a man gives <UNK> to a knife sticking out of a woman's <UNK> these people really know how to get in touch with nature br br the last part of the film is the most disturbing and at times it borders on hardcore pornography this part of the film made me think of <UNK> the holy mountain sweet movie and cannibal holocaust i've never been more disturbed in my life by what i witnessed a business man gets his <UNK> pulled apart by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> two women <UNK> on a christ figure and proceed to eat him like <UNK> bread and him with a tree branch poor guy the last part was so extreme that if i ever watch the film again i'll have close my eyes or slightly fast forward and mitch davis are obviously very talented to think they did this project in there early <UNK> <UNK> went on to direct the <UNK> influenced <UNK> 2002 which is a much better film and he co write the screenplay for <UNK> after dark horror masterpiece the abandoned <UNK> cruelty is a fascinating and unsettling journey with images that come from the <UNK> realm of everyday human minds well sort of
<START> i know i'm human and if you were all these things then you'd just attack me right now so some of you are still human this thing doesn't want to show itself it wants to hide inside an imitation it'll fight if it has to but it's vulnerable out in the open if it takes us over then it has no more enemies nobody left to kill it and then it's won br br john carpenter's the thing is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made ¬ñ fast clever and purely exciting from start to finish this is how all movies of the genre should be made br br taking place in the <UNK> in 1982 the movie focuses specifically on a group of american scientists we are given no introduction to their mission but are thrust into their existence when a pair of seemingly crazy <UNK> appears at their base camp chasing an escaped dog the <UNK> are killed and the dog finds its way into the colony which is when things really start to get crazy br br it is soon made quite clear that the dog is actually a shape shifting alien <UNK> which <UNK> itself upon the physical form of its victims ¬ñ in other words it begins to eat the americans and imitate them so well that the remaining humans cannot <UNK> the difference between their friends and enemies br br the pack of scientists led by <UNK> kurt russell begin to fight for their own survival using wits instead of <UNK> if the thing is indeed amongst them then how are they to go about revealing it how many things are there how can the thing be killed or can it be destroyed at all br br the <UNK> origins in the film are explained easily thirty thousand years ago a <UNK> <UNK> to earth and was frozen in the <UNK> ice the thing tried to escape and was discovered in the ice by the <UNK> who <UNK> released it from its natural prison br br the thing the movie itself is similar to <UNK> scott's iconic alien 1979 many comparisons have been made ¬ñ the protagonists are stranded in a desolate area stalked by a seldom seen <UNK> that manages to kill them off one by one however the thing ¬ñ for all practical purposes ¬ñ came first br br based on the famous short story who goes there by john w campbell jr writing under <UNK> as don a stuart the film was originally adapted as a feature production in 1951 by howard <UNK> and christian the result was the thing from another world an classic but to be fair it bore little resemblance to the short story and carpenter's remake does it more justice br br the idea of the thing being able to adapt the <UNK> of anyone is what essentially makes this movie so great and is the most vital link to the short story in 1951 the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably portray the shape shifting <UNK> but thirty one years brought many advances in <UNK> br br creature effects artist rob <UNK> does an excellent job of turning what could have easily become a cheesy gore fest into a <UNK> frightening and realistic mess of blood and fear the thing although never actually taking one specific form is constantly seen in a <UNK> stage and the effects are simply superb they still pack a punch twenty two years later br br <UNK> <UNK> score nominated for a <UNK> award at the time is a bit too electronic and <UNK> but nevertheless haunting when used correctly br br from the fact that its cast consists entirely of males to the fact that its ending is one of the most thought provoking and <UNK> conclusions of all time the thing ¬ñ by any standards ¬ñ is unconventional hollywood at its best it comes as no surprise that at the time of its release the thing performed poorly in theaters and e t ¬ñ released the same year and featuring a much <UNK> alien ¬ñ became the higher <UNK> picture of the two by far br br in the long run however the thing is superior in almost every <UNK> way spielberg's tale is outdated and <UNK> during its 20th <UNK> re release the thing on the other hand has gradually <UNK> a ladder of cult classics ¬ñ it is one of the most famous non famous movies ever made br br carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career ¬ñ from his amazing assault on <UNK> 13 1976 to the magnificent halloween 1978 to the disappointing and silly escape from l a 1996 the thing remains his very best motion picture although its reputation over the years has never been <UNK> enough to land it a spot on most great movies lists the thing is still one of my favorite horror films and ¬ñ upon close <UNK> ¬ñ masterfully crafted it is a daring and ingenious thrill ride that is simultaneously unique and chilling ¬ñ a genuine relief for film buffs who are tired of the same old horror knock offs this one at the very least is genuinely unpredictable
<START> <UNK> is what you experience when you watch this flick and then believe you saw something worthwhile this flick which tells of a trio of semi psycho <UNK> who are up to no good somewhere in the <UNK> desert is amateurish and just plain stupid the film suffers from an awful story a lousy screenplay and some terrible direction just to mention a few of the <UNK> if the flick has anything at all going for it it's b movie <UNK> <UNK> even performance don't waste your time on this turkey d
<START> not high art not even exceptionally innovative but a thoroughly enjoyable movie funny fresh intelligent there are still people out there who don't need millions of dollars to hide that they're out of ideas br br when you compare this to your average hollywood action flick you're comparing a <UNK> meal with a big mac
<START> this is the only thing i will be able to look back on from the year 2006 and say now that <UNK> it <UNK> hard and yet it also <UNK> tasty mr <UNK> added a nice little touch to this dish of a film before the opening credits even rolled now that tells you something this filmed <UNK> even before it started now i don't want to give to much away or be a spoiler but this movie <UNK> if you have heard the new album and thought to yourself this seems a bit <UNK> <UNK> material it is like i a merely playing <UNK> with satan what gives then this movie will elevate your appreciation for the music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic masterpiece for those who would want it better do not know what they want because better would no longer be the d this movie is the d period so venture if you dare to the local viewing theater if you to want to have your <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i'm a huge space buff and at nearly <UNK> i've just discovered this flick for the first time i came at it in a <UNK> way from space 1999 then <UNK> i went hunting for other anderson creations and found this was their first live action work what a home run i actually heard about this movie many years ago but never knew what it was called so i'm happy to have found it by accident br br these <UNK> were nothing short of amazing in their writing the execution of the completely believable and realistic looking models the quality of acting etc br br i don't think it looks dated at all let me tell you i'll take good old models over the fake looking cgi crap of today any time seriously most of the rocket scenes looked pretty real they had it down to a science if you choose to think of what you are looking at as real it isn't hard to actually believe it br br also the amount of detail in set designs the beautiful photography the whole look man i wish i could go back to that time they knew how to make great movies in the 60's personally i've lost all interest in hollywood movies today anybody with a budget can do cgi i hate it bring back the models think of all the people that style employed anyway i am <UNK> if you like good sci fi that's very well done you will do yourself a service by watching this
<START> <UNK> valley <UNK> is a movie about a possessed young girl do i need to describe any more of the plot to you the exorcist and the <UNK> of emily rose are two terrific terrifying movies classics imo <UNK> valley <UNK> is not not by a long shot it's certainly not as terrible as a low budget copy of the exorcist could have been from start to finish it has the feel of a made for sci fi channel production it's one of those movies that will probably be <UNK> and <UNK> on mystery science theater 3000 or a similar show br br the make up and effects were absolutely laughable the acting was <UNK> bad there was not a single performance that didn't lead to me rolling my eyes or <UNK> oh except maybe for <UNK> re animator combs as the sheriff the script wasn't that terrible but it certainly wasn't anything special br br it seems like through most of the movie everyone is more focused on who is sleeping with who than they are with the demon possessed girl in the other room oh there was something i learned from this movie apparently if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon then all you have to do is lock them in the room c'mon and if your daughter is possessed don't worry too much because all it does it make them talk in funny voices eat <UNK> try to stare you down and put fog machines in their bed other than that there is nothing to worry about apparently she was possessed with a low budget d list demon br br there was none of the ghastly deeds done by a list demons like <UNK> <UNK> painful body <UNK> or even <UNK> <UNK> br br totally laughable movie not worth even a <UNK> rental br br 2 out of 10
<START> i tried to love this movie i really did kevin bacon plays a cerebral <UNK> victim who is <UNK> by a 10 year old girl whose fantasies of digging to china flying away in a balloon and so on are her way of <UNK> with a dreary existence i admit i did fast forward through one of the scenes in which the two of them share friendship and simple pleasures while <UNK> piano music plays in the background okay three or four of those type scenes maybe nine or ten okay okay it was <UNK> but i did sit and watch most of them
<START> is the kind of experience one waits an entire lifetime to avoid ranks as one of the worst film directors of all time if however you love bad films see this at all costs
<START> this is an all around superb film a moving experience filled with real life emotion there's lessons to be learned here about love sex work religion and american culture regardless of one's sexual <UNK> br br while this film is also a <UNK> <UNK> of the <UNK> church of latter day saints belief system any conservative faith could easily take its place but it's a bit ironic that homosexuality is currently condemned by the <UNK> in no uncertain terms here's a faith that <UNK> for generations that <UNK> practice <UNK> and these true <UNK> only gave up this practice because they were forced to do so by the federal government in order for <UNK> to join the union talk about a unique form of <UNK> br br the sex scenes portrayed in the <UNK> version are <UNK> and surprisingly brief there's nothing here that would offend anyone with an open mind br br what this film makes so obvious is that homosexuality is perfectly natural to people who are gay as <UNK> is to people who are straight while love and sex are obviously quite different needs its absolutely beautiful beyond words when both occur at the same time between two adults profound erotic love is one of life's most precious gifts my <UNK> to the filmmakers for a job well done
<START> this low budget indie film <UNK> the word blah it will surprise most that this word can actually be found in the <UNK> defined as nonsense uninteresting dull lifeless the movie <UNK> the word because i would have to add to those four words pc crap pretentious on a pathetic level and pointless br br the film tries so hard to be hip and in touch with contemporary beautiful people struggling for je <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> behaviour and thinking do they think there is almost no plot to speak of though there is one to sleep to the <UNK> and most politically correct things about it are how a white woman is great friends with a young black stud the black street <UNK> player with a <UNK> for oh so wise <UNK> and advice and the fat black psychic isn't it beautiful how the races can get along after all <UNK> in the end the woman reads out poetry which is nothing more than one of her dull dear diary entries she gets a standing <UNK> although in real life her <UNK> would have more likely than not <UNK> off into deep <UNK> but this movie has little to do with real life even though that is where it's supposed to be happening in real life her poetry reading would have gotten standing only if she had the sense to include the <UNK> sexual details and then i <UNK> his huge penis against my <UNK> <UNK> pink little <UNK> cheers what's worse the lead actress has a dozen scenes in which she either <UNK> or <UNK> with someone yet they never have the sense to show her breasts which was clearly the only thing left to save this mess br br the black guy and the blonde who are separated by about a <UNK> in height hook up they look like a cheap variation of <UNK> and madonna as if the latter two aren't a cheap enough combination already nicole <UNK> mentioned by howard stern in his miss america book is the blonde stern writes of <UNK> that she took her <UNK> out yet i believe that when they took her <UNK> out they also sucked most of the meat out of her flesh and <UNK> by mistake for she looks <UNK> here br br the <UNK> player in one scene develops angel like wings he looks like al advertising angel food <UNK>

<START> this is an interesting hard to find movie from the early 70's starring jan michael vincent as a young man who doesn't make the cut as a marine dressed in <UNK> outfits to <UNK> them as they are sent home the failed <UNK> are sent <UNK> vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young richard gere who has just returned from a tour in the pacific as a hard core marine <UNK> character is already jaded and <UNK> <UNK> and he takes advantage of <UNK> innocence stealing his <UNK> uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an <UNK> <UNK> character whose name is marion takes <UNK> outfit and is suddenly transformed into a marine marion <UNK> <UNK> his way into <UNK> and stops at a little norman <UNK> like little town in the local <UNK> he meets rose who immediately catches his eye staying with parents marion <UNK> all sorts of attention from the towns folks mr suspects marion and wonders how a marine could still be so innocent the story also brings up the japanese camps as the towns folks go 3 <UNK> marion is shot accidentally during this hunt but there's still a happy ending which <UNK> me a bit i would have preferred a little more drama anyway this captures <UNK> at the peak of his 70's performances buster and <UNK> baby blue marine and white line fever in the mid 70's were amazingly good <UNK> performances he was both an action star and a heart <UNK> all at the same time he made a lot of quality movies during his career and continued to do so up into the mid 80's with the great tv show <UNK> he does a very good job in this as quietly <UNK> the way people treat him in his uniform as he travels across the country he must have performed some of the stunt work as well there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie and it looks like he's the guy getting tossed down the river to me but really at the height of his popularity this movie could have done so much more with talent and his looks innocence can only be so interesting evil as explored in buster and <UNK> is much more dramatic anyway <UNK> <UNK> is delightful as rose the whole look of the movie is like a norman <UNK> painting the <UNK> scenes are gorgeous must have been filmed in canada
<START> once again i've been <UNK> by seemingly intelligent reviews making seemingly intelligent comments about an obviously crappy movie i actually put my shoes on got in my car burned expensive <UNK> and drove to the nearest rental place after reading said reviews and paid the requisite 4 dollars and change to rent this thing i'm telling you this one's not worth the <UNK> <UNK> spent on <UNK> one's <UNK> finger to switch channels on a tv remote br br i even gave it a few more minutes after seeing all the tell tale signs of a <UNK> dog pile these presented as <UNK> <UNK> of a director who is a going <UNK> or b is only <UNK> interested in the film he she is <UNK> to create i saw similar <UNK> with john carpenter's string of ridiculous over the past number of years br br here are a couple of scenes as <UNK> evidence the priest is having a disturbing dream supposedly a <UNK> of <UNK> to come since he seems hell bent on opening the <UNK> feature which houses the demon the dream is a goofy <UNK> of disjointed images right out of the twilight stock footage a <UNK> clock <UNK> through the dream <UNK> <UNK> what the <UNK> mystery of time big deal a <UNK> head painted in demon features with <UNK> store quality halloween make up <UNK> back and forth in a <UNK> frenzy every time i see this effect a big fat rip off from <UNK> ladder it <UNK> me off this in itself almost instantly <UNK> a film br br the whole build up of the <UNK> dig itself is laughable everything is so obvious so tired and over <UNK> the only possible response is boredom at one point in the dig the priest comments on finding the <UNK> of angels surrounding a <UNK> they're all pointing down toward the crypt with their weapons he <UNK> look at these surrounding <UNK> it's as if they are holding something down this is supposed to build tension critical mass but it doesn't even come close how can there be suspense if you treat the audience like a bunch of morons having to explain the suspense as you go along the imagery is over done in the first place but the added comments only add insult to injury in my opinion soon thereafter the tomb is <UNK> with the remains of the soldiers placed there to guard the main another shameless rip off of the keep btw who for crying out loud did the make up effects for this film the blood actually had that <UNK> quality one might see in 70's <UNK> flicks at this point i became almost convinced that they simply forgot the make up and had to go to wal mart in the interest of time and money br br don't listen to glowing comments on this one i'll be keeping a suspicious eye on <UNK> too looks like it might be time to hang up his <UNK> perhaps a close friend will offer a gentle <UNK> to quit while there's still dignity in memory of films gone by
<START> why do people need to follow the opinion of the <UNK> of masses and critics random hearts directed by the brilliant sydney <UNK> who has a small role in the film too is another harrison ford vehicle as such it is quite good and entertaining surely anyone who goes to see it has this in mind or read the book which is no better even <UNK> scott thomas fans myself included knew it would be a variation of her again playing the love interest of her <UNK> uncle even as such the film is satisfying what's so bad about this movie that is much better in the other much higher rated harrison ford vehicles this film is no masterpiece but it's not as bad as the masses would have the potential viewer believe
<START> i read the book before i saw the movie i knew the movie was going to be good because the book was great i seriously recommend you see this amazing fantastic movie i know you will like it when i went to see it i was there with my sister and there was nobody that was with us i was a little disappointed but nobody that i know has gone in to that movie and came out saying that was a horrible movie nobody can it is so great i think everyone will like it to bad nobody wants to see it anyway i hope from what you have heard about this movie from me will make you want to see this movie i guarantee you'll like it as much as i do im obsessed i am
<START> <UNK> painted fire <UNK> the life of korean painter <UNK> <UNK> amidst the changing political landscape of late 19th century korea br br however the themes of this film center around the process of artistic creation through the fire of desire of the artist and the expectations and demands of their audience and society br br <UNK> <UNK> is played masterfully as a complex character who changes from the innocent excitement of youth to a hardened alcoholic tortured soul this characterization mirrors the young eager artist that finds it more and more difficult to <UNK> the spirit of artistic creation within himself without letting the creative fire out via drink <UNK> and desire br br although this character development proceeds overall gradually through the film the emotional complexity of <UNK> is still played in a constantly <UNK> manner building to the <UNK> finale interestingly the montage of the film parallels this constantly changing and seemingly wild emotion or fire of the artist as scenes <UNK> transition from one time and location to another without any conventional to the audience that such a scene change will occur for example many scenes would change seemingly in mid conversation picking up at another point and location br br the visual scenery of the film is presented beautifully and also from stark and perhaps bleak black and white scenery to more colorful and alive <UNK> that again parallel the paintings of <UNK> either in simple black <UNK> on white paper or with color added <UNK> of color enter the film at points as the artist <UNK> nature and especially women that then become reflected in his paintings br br the theme of an <UNK> individual desire to create versus the expectations and demands of society <UNK> in the film through various points including class distinction the <UNK> of government over the artist the accepted <UNK> of the artistic elite and the base desires of the common masses instead of creating his own completely original works <UNK> finds himself mostly <UNK> masterpieces of other artists throughout east asia the question thus <UNK> if recreation itself deserves artistic merit br br i wish that i was more familiar with the political events of the period to firmly grasp how they tied into the story but beyond any comparison to the current role of korean government in artistic expression and or censorship i cannot comment br br overall an extremely well acted film and the cinematography is often breathtaking a great film to see and then <UNK> over
<START> the best independent film of 2001 i went to see the wind at the recommendation of friends who caught it at dances with films festival in la last summer it's a great scary well made film the score was amazing can't wait to see his next movie
<START> the whole town of is afraid because they <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> brother and he is coming back for revenge at least that's what they think br br a great johnny and a very interesting early mario star in this <UNK> western obviously filmed in the <UNK> br br <UNK> dixon is coming back to to investigate why his brother was <UNK> he is a loner and <UNK> par <UNK> everybody is afraid of him the mexican <UNK> fighting the that took their land as well as the decent citizens that <UNK> brother they <UNK> him because they thought he stole their money instead of bringing it to dallas to the safety of the bank there but this is is only half the truth as we find out in the course of this psychologically interesting western br br but beware it's kind of a depressing movie as everybody turns out to be guilty somehow and definitely everybody is bad to the bone br br still i enjoyed it very much and gave it an 8 10 strange that only less than 5 people voted for this movie as of january <UNK> 2002
<START> this was supposed to be set in the bible belt of northern ireland well as someone who grew up there and was a child in the era depicted in the film it just didn't ring true the accents were all over the place anything but county <UNK> the church didn't resemble any i have ever seen the church of god is a <UNK> <UNK> but the one in the film was certainly not <UNK> the elderly minister at the beginning was dressed in the <UNK> of the church of ireland <UNK> and no c of i would call itself the church of god the minister was often addressed as <UNK> they may do that in some parts of the world but i never heard it when i lived in that area <UNK> were addressed as mr br br this film was very badly <UNK> and cast fairly typical of irish cinema annoying a film can have a great plot but if it doesn't look authentic it is rubbish
<START> this movie states through its protagonist that the world is essentially sadness and pain and those that ignore this have <UNK> on one can argue whether this is true or not but even if you accept this as true the movie's ending either a <UNK> this by saying there can be some good in tragic situations or b forgets this and uses a cliched montage in order to leave the audience feeling <UNK> br br that the movie <UNK> <UNK> its protagonist by presenting him as a sympathetic character despite any evidence for that sympathy shows contempt for the supporting characters who were the most compelling in the film br br so what you have in this film is a script that is not consistent in its theme and direction that does not bring the ending into sync with the rest of the film there are excellent performances given by every member of the cast especially spacey <UNK> martin <UNK> and ann it's a shame that they weren't supported by a better writer director
<START> i am very disappointed because i expected a real ride as promised in the many reviews the script is very bad with lot of holes and the direction too the director failed completely to develop each violent scene with thrills and suspense it tries very hard to follow a wannabe thriller therefore i had to watch how every bullet was spent without giving any sense to me i was always asking what kind of movie i am watching then i didn't like that she <UNK> <UNK> one cigarette after the other but perhaps the film was supported partly by the <UNK> industry the end is also very disappointing i cannot understand how jodie foster could have been nominated for the golden globe in this worst role of her life jodie therefore i liked very much panic room or flight plan this is definitely one of the worst i have ever seen 4 10
<START> i'd never heard of zero budget auteur neil johnson before seeing on dvd at hollywood video a few minutes into the movie i realize this isn't a bad thing like many straight to video sci fi movies this is a film dominated largely by <UNK> bad special effects and a constant parade of pretentious sci fi concepts that fail to create a story br br viewers are tortured with a religious sounding text introduction then a spoken introduction followed by a narration by the main character's daughter to me this seemed like a smoke screen to mask a film with ugly visuals and zero character emphasis some people on here seem all too ready to take this film seriously and <UNK> it's seemingly new age messages hook line and <UNK> these <UNK> reviews must come from the same kind of people who can <UNK> themselves into thinking that things like battlefield earth was a brilliant movie or that is just as good as coke br br those who were <UNK> in by the cheesy cover art can look forward to lousy acting in small doses <UNK> with long <UNK> of people not talking rotten computer animated effects in extra large doses and irritating talking computers what you won't get is excitement emotional <UNK> memorable dialogue or a good story br br is <UNK> bull and the constant <UNK> of the narration proves it real science fiction hell real film making is about characters and their dialogue not special effects and dull <UNK> this is right down there with similar direct to video sci fi like one and <UNK> <UNK> if the boredom of strange <UNK> and alien visitor is something you seek out by all means watch the crap out of this if you enjoy good storytelling and hate fake lens <UNK> you're better off with a real movie
<START> this movie was recommended to me by the same person that blessed me with a copy of the chronicles of <UNK> <UNK> is one of the most amazing screenplays ever written it is well executed acted and directed the cinematography is a bit dark for my taste but i'm sure it was intended to be so the screenplay is like poetry in portions of the movie through out the movie i found myself taking pause to reflect on the comments just made on screen this is a wonderful piece of cinema and i can only hope that more people will run across it and add reviews fair warning though this was a 6 <UNK> movie for me very touching very heartfelt performances
<START> i've enjoyed watching lost from the beginning and endured a few bad actors in poorly written episodes because when lost is good it's really good but this episode that features mr <UNK> demise had so many drawn out scenes with lingering closeups of bad acting that i found myself <UNK> the fast forward button this episode stood out so far as by far the worst in fact the variation in quality of lost has been so inconsistent i find myself often wondering how many writers they are using br br i will continue to watch but hope things get better and hope i stop secretly wishing for the sub par actors in the series to die off
<START> a stunningly well made film with exceptional acting directing writing and photography br br a <UNK> finds married life not what she expected and starts to question her duty to herself versus her duty to society together with her sister in law she makes some radical <UNK> from conventional roles and <UNK>
<START> as you can see i loved the book so much i use the title for my internet <UNK> and have for over 15 years okay so it had to be spelled <UNK> to fit the name character limit for the <UNK> at the time but what could i do if anyone every finds this movie i would absolutely love to see it janet <UNK> is great in everything else i've seen of hers i think she would have made a great and it even features early clive owen from before <UNK> a great series itself what's not to love i hope the powers that be wise up and make this available on dvd soon with some of the true <UNK> they <UNK> out it's about time well executed productions make it on the market too
<START> the violent men marked the finest collaboration of <UNK> with glenn ford in an intensely satisfying drama of rugged primitive <UNK> br br ford is john <UNK> a former <UNK> captain who is <UNK> to get married and start a new his fianc√©e caroline <UNK> may <UNK> is desperate to move east and to see him selling his spread to lee edward g robinson br br <UNK> is not even much of a but he do understand that there is something big building up in the in the army they used to call it pressure ' first cole brian keith comes back from texas to help his brother run then a tough kid with a fancy gun richard <UNK> shows up on the then all the small <UNK> are forced out getting the same kind of <UNK> saw himself either running like they did or stand and br br but can he easily deals with a man who sends six killers to shoot an old man in the back can he easily <UNK> with a man who started with a few <UNK> of land and now owns practically the whole valley br br all that grass and sand ever meant to the ex <UNK> army officer the past three it was a place to regain his out of habit of taking advice <UNK> <UNK> what happen in this valley is no concern of mine and much to the disappointment of the remaining <UNK> and <UNK> who pressure him to stay on he decides to accept offer to fulfill the promise he made to his br br when lee's younger brother cole made the wrong move trying to push <UNK> make up his mind by <UNK> one of his ranch hands <UNK> got mad and warns the two brothers that he is going to stay and will fight them for the <UNK> of being let br br brian keith plays the <UNK> brother who's behind the killing he dreams to have position and respect in running one day br br lee's ambitious wife martha barbara stanwyck secretly hates herself and her <UNK> stanwyck plays the part of a loving wife who can't bear the touch of her husband's br br edward g robinson is good enough as the crippled owner who promised the whole valley to his wife unaware that she is having an affair with his younger br br <UNK> foster is too sensitive as the adult daughter well aware of her mother's br br the violent men uses the wide screen technology to emphasize the scope and power of this harrowing action drama making it a perfect example of the <UNK> most enduring
<START> this ranks as my favorite movie of all time it's the best spoof of a science fiction movie ever the fact that it was a <UNK> of star wars just made it all the better br br i love slapstick think of this as the marx brothers or the three stooges meet star wars the writing is hilarious the effects are a hoot the free association that goes on <UNK> all sorts of things coming out of left field i almost wet my pants when the <UNK> monster <UNK> the princess br br space balls was a much longer movie but only had about 15 minutes of good material in it and i felt sort of ripped off afterwards like buying a <UNK> that turned out to be mostly filler <UNK> wars despite being only about 15 minutes long would be worth paying a feature price imo
<START> don't listen to what the critics have always said about this cute charming little movie madonna is great in this clever comedy i worked at a video store for several years and suggested this movie to lots of customers no one ever brought it back and screamed at me for telling them to rent it everyone always enjoyed it it's actually a great movie for kids too
<START> i was recently at a <UNK> birthday party with five other girls all my age eleven all of us thinking it would be some harmless little movie such as jaws decided to rent it along with rat race we watched rat race after when a stranger calls as to ease our fear we put the movie on at 11 00 at night and lay together in our sleeping <UNK> hiding behind covers for most of it i screamed five times which is unusual for me as i get scared in movies but never scared enough to actually scream br br all of us were terrified to even leave the bedroom as we were all positive the stalker <UNK> as we called him for some reason would get us i played a mean trick one everyone was all <UNK> off once rat race was over i <UNK> under my sleeping bag and said quietly and <UNK> have you checked the <UNK> they all screamed like nuts and were so scared all in all i would rate this movie a 9 the only thing i didn't like was that 1 there were too many false <UNK> when jill thinks the stalker is there and 2 the kids never woke up during the whole thing until <UNK> kidnapped them and <UNK> them in the <UNK> at which time all they did was cry like babies i would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes thriller but one thing i am so not <UNK> past 9 00 <UNK> ever
<START> <UNK> first spoken words in this 1930 film <UNK> audiences and became part of hollywood legend garbo had become a star in her first american film the <UNK> in <UNK> and audiences waited <UNK> this film to see if garbo could make the transition to <UNK> she did and while <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> fell by the <UNK> because of their accents garbo <UNK> on for another decade despite the <UNK> of this film garbo is really excellent especially in the opening scene with the equally great marie <UNK> as <UNK> the two great stars trade dirty looks and sharp words as they size each other up while they have a few drinks and set the tone for the remainder of the film garbo was 25 <UNK> was 60 charles <UNK> is ok as matt and george f marion is good as old chris marion <UNK> this role on broadway in <UNK> and also played it in the <UNK> silent version with <UNK> sweet this eugene o'neill play is a true classic yet oddly was never filmed again anna christie ranks as one of <UNK> greatest performances and despite the <UNK> of the film and the <UNK> of the story she is truly a marvel see this one for garbo and <UNK>
<START> guys what can i tell you i'm <UNK> i can't remember how many times i talk to americans and let alone that they don't have a slightest clue where is <UNK> but they say things like there's a war going on there right or i've never imagined that in a place like <UNK> people have internet go watch bruce <UNK> the man with the screaming brain i was curious about this movie cause 1 i'm bruce campbell fan evil dead trilogy and the adventures of <UNK> county jr 2 the movie was shot entirely on location in <UNK> the second after alien apocalypse which is also nearly unwatchable 3 i enjoy nice b movies br br well the movie presents our country like a never ending gypsy town where they raid your car wave around illegal guns and you can get killed any moment and <UNK> line bull <UNK> is more than <UNK> br br ted <UNK> and <UNK> make a great team bruce does his special beats himself up and that's all nothing more to see here br br give this movie 10 just because of <UNK> cult status but it doesn't deserve more than 3 waste of film
<START> worst horror film ever but funniest film ever rolled in one you have got to see this film it is so cheap it is but you have to see it really p s watch the <UNK>
<START> it has taken several viewings for me to fully appreciate this film initially i was struck by the stylized sets but found the rest slow going and dull i thought that such a sensational subject needed the ken russell treatment to take it way over the top i now find the <UNK> restraint placed on the production by widow to be an asset some of the more lurid aspects of life are <UNK> and <UNK> by <UNK> themes from his novels i think it helps to be familiar with the novels that's what finally made the difference for me still feel the film overall could be a little <UNK> and <UNK> but it's genuinely unique and deserves serious attention love the fact that the japanese characters speak japanese not english the philip glass score is mesmerizing
