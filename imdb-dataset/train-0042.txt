<START> the dvd for <UNK> <UNK> castle of blood is very odd that's because parts of the film are in french with subtitles and the rest is dubbed into english from the french sometimes characters switched between the two in the middle of a scene when i tried to get the film to be just subtitled or just dubbed it made no difference odd but still watchable br br the story <UNK> to be based on a poe story though i can't recall which one in fact the character of poe appears in the beginning and end of the film though it didn't look especially like him br br a rich man makes a bet with a guy down on his luck that he cannot stay the entire night in a manner home it seems like an easy bet to win even if the house is very creepy however it can't be that easy as the rich guy says that all those who previously took the bet died yet this fool still wants to make the <UNK> while in the home he meets lovely barbara steele within and falls <UNK> for her later however he learns that she died more than a decade earlier how can this be i could tell you more about the plot but don't want to spoil any of the suspense see it for yourself to find out the rest of the story br br this film gets very high marks for creating a creepy atmosphere the house black white cinematography and music work together to make for a scary looking film as for the plot it's interesting especially because there are many twists and turns so many that you are wondering just who is and who isn't among the undead by the end of the film br br the only negative is that i felt sorry for the poor snake that was needlessly killed crazy as it might sound i felt sorry for it and it hardly seemed necessary br br also parents may want to know that towards the end there is a bit of nudity a strikingly beautiful woman appears topless but it's hardly necessary for the plot
<START> one of the most excellent movies ever produced in russia and certainly the best one made during the decline of the <UNK> incredibly clever hilarious and dramatic at the same time superb acting overall a masterpiece score it 10 10 br br
<START> before films like 'the texas chainsaw massacre ' <UNK> ' and <UNK> changed the view of horror forever there was a more gothic and far less violent era in the genre films like the hammer horror series and <UNK> <UNK> were what scared and thrilled audiences throughout the 60s and early 70s i can't tell you how many times i rented this film during my childhood but i did because there was something about it i didn't want to limit myself to the slasher and zombies movies of the 70s and 80s and films like this production from the famous but sadly long gone <UNK> film company were a good start br br pros a grand eerie music score strong performances from a stellar cast brilliant cinematography plenty good old fashioned thrills and chills especially in the first and last vignettes some haunting moments and images moves at a slow but <UNK> pace the house is one spooky oppressive <UNK> great production design and set decoration which give the film a real old gothic horror feel depends more on mood and <UNK> chills than on gore and gratuitous nudity for it's thrills br br cons some pacing issues in the first half aside from the 'the cloak ' the rest of the stories feel like they've been done before clichés <UNK> the second story <UNK> ' has fine acting and it's moments but is the weakest of the four in terms of scares and suspense the low budget really shows at times br br final thoughts after seeing this film for the first time in many years i can see why i rented it so frequently it's not a masterpiece by any means but it's a good example of a time when horror films were made with style and class watch this one with the lights off br br my rating 3 5 5
<START> this cool marvel superhero game pays proper tribute by staying true to the comics of all the marvel superhero games that have been so lame with weak graphics and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in both <UNK> it also features the voice of stan lee the creator of <UNK> comics br br as you'd expect <UNK> does whatever a spider can he does more than spin <UNK> in fact he uses them as weapons and <UNK> when he's not using web in combat he punches and kicks as well <UNK> has his hands full as he battles <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and dr <UNK> to name a few look for captain america in a cameo br br most of the levels are challenging but some of them require patience to beat the only complaint about this game is that it's so short and can be completed in less than three hours if you're a real marvel superhero fan this game is for you but don't expect long <UNK> better luck in <UNK> 2 my <UNK> 9 out of 10
<START> i enjoyed this film i thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that's never happened before a secret service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot unfortunately for michael <UNK> character pete <UNK> they think he's the mole but he isn't br br he's just a morally flawed agent having an affair with the first lady since he's doing that he's unable to give an acceptable <UNK> <UNK> and that makes him suspect number one when it's revealed there is a plot to kill the president br br <UNK> is forced to go on the <UNK> but at the same time he's still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president douglas does a fine job in this role i don't always care the people he plays but he's an excellent actor <UNK> sutherland david <UNK> is equally as good at least in here as the fellow ss boss who <UNK> down douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth when he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop if they can the plot the crooks are interesting too by the way also i have never and never will unfortunately see a first lady who looks as good as kim basinger br br this is simply a slick action flick that entertains start to finish are there holes in it of course probably a number of them and a reason you see so many critical comments however it is unfairly <UNK> here it just isn't intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website my advice chill just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue yes it gets a little rambo ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment which is what movies are all about
<START> maybe i'm being too generous with the rating but i just love this movie i've seen it so many times but every time i see it i fall in love with it all over again it's just a simple romantic comedy with nothing huge or <UNK> that happens but i'm a big romantic and this movie is romantic i love meg ryan and tim robbins and walter <UNK> is so funny the scientists make me laugh so much i definitely recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it it's such a clean good movie and those are so rare now my 20 year old brother likes this movie too so it's not just a chick flick i recommend it if you need to laugh or if you're just lonely and need to watch a romance if you yourself can't participate in one it's a good <UNK>
<START> i really enjoyed this debut by ring director <UNK> <UNK> if you've seen ring beforehand then you'll be familiar with the style and idea of this flick it's got a subtle <UNK> about it that works better than the constant and predictable <UNK> that <UNK> most mainstream movies of this genre if you like films that give you the chills then you will probably like this one a good creepy debut by <UNK> <UNK> 8 10
<START> another friday the 13th ripoff even featuring some of its music a group of young adults get together for a small high school reunion and start getting slaughtered a la jason <UNK> could it be that nerd they used to torment in school br br routine slash fest is fun for fans of the genre and contains the usual t a <UNK> for films if its <UNK> the ending is a bit more imaginative than your standard slasher br br mpaa rated for violence gore language sexuality nudity and some drug content
<START> this is a really interesting film it's the first time i have seen the relationship between an older woman and a younger guy on screen without it being <UNK> for the director of <UNK> hill this is a bold move to something serious
<START> the obvious parallels between walt disney's charming fantasy <UNK> and <UNK> and c s lewis chronicles of <UNK> are pretty apparent there are more <UNK> here than comparing <UNK> and <UNK> than with mary <UNK> even though a lot of the same creative talent went into the two disney films br br like the chronicles of <UNK> it involves some english children leaving london during the <UNK> and coming to live in the country and those kids have to deal with a world of magic but unlike c s lewis the <UNK> kids have the magic <UNK> their world and help defeat the people making a mess of it in the here and now no <UNK> to a fantasy kingdom like the <UNK> kids br br no heavy duty philosophy here from walt disney except maybe it's not a good thing to mess with witches even apprentice ones like angela lansbury who learn their magic from a <UNK> like david <UNK> ms lansbury didn't get to be one of the most <UNK> of performers for nothing she carries her own brand of magic that even the special effects boys at disney couldn't top and they won an oscar for the magic kingdom in that department for this film br br two performers made their farewell to films in <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> played her last role in this film she <UNK> many a film in the united kingdom as one of their best loved music hall performers and that grand character actor <UNK> owen as the retired general who leads the old home guard in war and in song <UNK> <UNK> to film audiences around the world br br the team of robert b <UNK> and richard m <UNK> who wrote the score for mary <UNK> wrote a good and <UNK> one here the age of not believing was nominated for an oscar but lost to the theme from <UNK> personally though i do like david <UNK> tribute to that most colorful of london streets <UNK> road br br <UNK> and <UNK> is a fine fantasy film that still holds up well after almost 40 years imagine what it would be like with computer generated graphics
<START> i rented this dvd for two reasons a cast of great actors and the director even though robert altman can be hit or miss in this case it was a big miss altman's attempt at creating suspense fell on its <UNK> after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like dead again i didn't think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey and i hope it didn't ruin his reputation robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one time oscar winners on a <UNK> spiral that includes acting in eating money films such as this one duvall was once a great actor in excellent films even though his best performance was not tender <UNK> but the great <UNK> this movie was truly a big waste of time i give it a 2 out of 10
<START> manipulative drama about a glamorous model <UNK> <UNK> who is raped by a geeky but <UNK> musician chris sarandon â to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister played by real life sibling <UNK> whose music teacher he is while the central courtroom action holds the attention â thanks largely to a commanding performance by anne <UNK> as <UNK> lawyer â the film is too often merely glossy but also dramatically unconvincing the jury ostensibly takes the <UNK> side because a the girl invited assault due to the <UNK> nature of her profession and b she was offering no resistance to her presumed <UNK> when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together what the f she was clearly tied up â what resistance could she realistically offer br br the second half of the film â involving <UNK> rape of the sister which curiously <UNK> <UNK> 2002 by occurring in a tunnel â is rather contrived <UNK> character should have known better than to trust sarandon after what he did to her sister but <UNK> herself <UNK> <UNK> the line of work which had <UNK> led to her <UNK> experience almost immediately the climax â in which sarandon gets his just <UNK> with <UNK> turning suddenly into a <UNK> and <UNK> vigilante â is however a crowd <UNK> in the style of death wish 1974 incidentally <UNK> italian movie <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> was behind both films br br <UNK> worth noting how the two <UNK> <UNK> lives took wildly different turns this was the film debut of both <UNK> career never took off despite her <UNK> good looks and commendable participation here â while <UNK> would soon receive an oscar nomination for woody <UNK> manhattan 1979 and interestingly would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when <UNK> the role of real life <UNK> <UNK> dorothy <UNK> in bob <UNK> star 80 1983 with the added pressure of a couple of failed <UNK> <UNK> took <UNK> in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug <UNK> in 1996 <UNK> the <UNK> family had a history of <UNK> â notably the <UNK> grandfather celebrated author ernest who died of a self inflicted <UNK> wound in <UNK>
<START> roll is a wonderful little film toby malone plays an 18 year old kid very well acted by the way who is into soccer <UNK> cousin takes him out the night before his big game on an adventure with many twists and turns involving two gym <UNK> a drug lord some tough <UNK> some cops and some prostitutes and the movie keeps us guessing as to which characters are on which side of the law what the <UNK> of either gym bag is and even what gender a key biker is parts of it reminded me of lock stock and two smoking <UNK> br br for me roll <UNK> three opinions that i already held before seeing roll those opinions are 1 i really want to visit australia one day the country and cities are beautiful and it looks like such a cool place for a vacation br br 2 some of the best filmmakers in the are australian the cinematography in roll was especially impressive i loved the stylized colors and lighting in many of the scenes br br 3 australian women are hot
<START> this was a movie that i hoped i could suggest to my american friends but after 4 attempts to watch the movie to finish i knew i couldn't even watch the damn thing to close you are almost convinced the actual war didn't even last that long other's will try to question my <UNK> for <UNK> a movie like this but flat out you can't go from watching saving private ryan to <UNK> forget about the movie budget difference or the audience those don't <UNK> a director from making an intelligent movie the length of the movie is not so bad and the fact that it is repetitive they keep attacking the same hill but give it different names i thought the <UNK> was a terrible <UNK> this hill looked like my backyard the character development sequences the <UNK> flashbacks looking back to their last moments before being <UNK> should have been throughout the movie and not just <UNK> into one long memory to this day i have yet to watch the ending but there was a much better movie not saying much called border
<START> spoilers will be in this the movie could have been better if they had just had a different script director and cgi <UNK> not much right the movie has a man starting his own theme park <UNK> <UNK> on a deserted island where people can see dinosaurs <UNK> <UNK> and it is called <UNK> <UNK> primal park i do not mind rip offs because there are no original ideas for these kind of movies but this one just <UNK> you in the face with it r e p e a t e d l y there is even the <UNK> <UNK> head on the design thing the <UNK> that are not <UNK> according to mr primal park just ancient killing cats are rather <UNK> but the <UNK> accomplishment is the one i call <UNK> because after <UNK> of one big cat a hero is relaxing a little because there is only one left enter the weird feeding guy who says <UNK> we made three the third being a monster who pulls itself around with its front feet great <UNK> a group of college students are also on the island for a <UNK> hunt there test to get into their <UNK> frat or sort always thought that needed a short <UNK> out of the ones who do live only one has completed their task so i got a kick out of that oh yeah the mandatory evil <UNK> must die <UNK> is in force with not one but two of them mr primal <UNK> death is the most laughable thing you will see in one of these movies as a <UNK> <UNK> tooth <UNK> loose courtesy of <UNK> <UNK> a few <UNK> and <UNK> the man through the throat if i had only gotten away so easy i like <UNK> better than this spin off
<START> after leaving tv's popular the andy griffith show don <UNK> gave movie stardom a <UNK> try with a series of inane but <UNK> pleasing comedy vehicles unfortunately the reluctant astronaut filmed on the cheap as were most of <UNK> movies is much worse than his others don plays a small town <UNK> who gets accepted to astronaut training camp but not as a candidate for space travel they want him as their new janitor some may say the weak satire <UNK> on <UNK> then fresh fever for the new age of technology but the flick is really just a dim excuse to keep restless children occupied it gets off to a good start with an ok set up and nostalgic locations but it becomes increasingly more <UNK> and idiotic from
<START> in 2004 i liked it then it became very stupid it suggests that kids are brainless it insults children cartoon network used to be great one of the shows i liked was <UNK> it did manage to be interesting and imaginative in its approach to children programming the show <UNK> home for imaginary friends is like putting 20 <UNK> of sugar in your <UNK> it seems as if today's television producers are only interested in making money rather than engaging the <UNK> of children and making money lately my children are <UNK> in to the old shows 60's to find something interesting to watch perhaps in the absence of originality for television to look to its past and <UNK> children's <UNK> from days gone by
<START> this film comes as the ultimate disappointment in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for me it <UNK> <UNK> from its every frame so i'm not going to <UNK> it thoroughly either but some observations br br 1 if the premise is <UNK> why we get to see city landscapes with <UNK> green trees i wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the <UNK> context of the film in which <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> for <UNK> and <UNK> the trivial substitute sex or it is only a matter of lousy film making not giving a damn about being coherent br br 2 we don't get to know what had happened to the porn actress why she is unconscious or presumably dead it seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully <UNK> delivered but in retrospect her <UNK> body proves to be a cheap <UNK> gimmick a <UNK>  just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in br br 3 nothing is expressed in this movie that antonioni hadn't expressed better 40 years ago  and without needlessly <UNK> his actors br br 4 the musical numbers recycled from 'the <UNK> felt like a secondary <UNK> idea of artistic <UNK> executed on that very secondary school level of skill if that was the point the point sucked
<START> i saw this movie by luck just because i was going through a phase where i had a new found admiration for bill <UNK> and wanted to see all of his recent movies and thank god i did this movie has stuck with me ever since and remain one of my favorites the story revolves around two girls who <UNK> on a dramatic journey in a foreign country where they'll learn the true meaning of freedom br br alice and <UNK> were just trying to spend a vacation together before going to college but their trip ended up a much more complicated story the struggle they go through as they are arrested in thailand and became prisoners is very moving and intense the acting is amazing the images extraordinary the soundtrack is fantastic and so right for the movie and the message <UNK> definitely powerful i actually can't even find the right words to describe how this movie makes me feel every time i watch it i know some people haven't appreciated as much as me by the rating the movie has but i swear this one you have to see i promise it will stick with you
<START> when i first saw this film in the 1980's i was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since i considered myself grown up and out of the <UNK> street muppets age i honestly don't remember if i liked it at the time or not however somewhere in college i watched this film again and it wound up going and staying into my personal best films ever collection br br this film is loaded with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppets i mean obviously the muppets always have <UNK> to adults and children because there's humor <UNK> towards both generations but come on <UNK> is accidentally <UNK> telling someone i don't take my clothes off for anyone even if it is artistic there's a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with <UNK> the frog then the father doesn't want to hear it <UNK> saves a chicken with mouth to mouth <UNK> <UNK> and afterwards says i think we're engaged now these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling add to that very smart dialogue very smart new york broadway <UNK> <UNK> humor the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that don't border on kid level cheesy whatsoever this film is a masterpiece i don't throw 10 's out on a regular basis but this one deserves it over 20 years later this film totally holds up perhaps even more so the muppets never were and never will be again as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is q
<START> the sight of kareena kapoor in a two piece bikini is about the only thing that wakes you up from your sleep while watching tashan  the mega disappointing mind numbing new film at the cinemas this weekend bad films are bad films and we see some every week but tashan is not just a bad film it's a terrible film terrible because it takes its audience for granted terrible also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a plot or any common sense only because they've got big movie stars <UNK> written and directed by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tashan is what you'd describe as a road movie but one that's going in all the wrong directions saif ali khan stars as jimmy cliff a call centre executive who's hired to teach english to <UNK> that's anil kapoor playing an ambitious up gangster desperate to go cool <UNK> got his eye on <UNK> the <UNK> pretty young assistant played by kareena kapoor who uses jimmy to <UNK> her boss of 25 <UNK> <UNK> determined to recover his money and also to <UNK> both jimmy and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his most trusted henchman to do the job so you have akshay kumar as bachchan <UNK> the <UNK> faithful <UNK> from <UNK> who tracks down the <UNK> and <UNK> the stolen money that's hidden across the length and <UNK> of the country much like those bad eighties <UNK> tashan too is held together by a <UNK> script <UNK> on a <UNK> plot but the <UNK> so over the top so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect instead of a coherent screenplay or a traditional three act structure you get a handful of set pieces around which most of the scenes are loosely constructed that <UNK> item song in the desert the bullet <UNK> action scene at a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bikini moment even that ridiculous climatic action scene complete with shaolin monks a water <UNK> <UNK> through a dirty <UNK> and believe it or not even a <UNK> style horse driven <UNK> in all fairness not all these set pieces are badly done the item song in the desert is quite neat actually but very little of it makes any sense in the larger picture because you're just going from one piece to another without any help from the script really little do you expect in a seemingly fast paced road movie to find a <UNK> sentimental flashback track about childhood <UNK> you see the problem with tashan is nobody associated with this film knew what film they were making what's more i don't think they cared either the film <UNK> of arrogance <UNK> <UNK> in elements of every genre without actually bothering to stop and see if the mix does work tashan is like an <UNK> <UNK> there are films that kill you <UNK> and then there's tashan a film that kills you with excess <UNK> <UNK> with glossy finish camera work exotic locations and fancy costumes every frame of the film probably cost <UNK> to put together but it still feels like a hollow piece in the end because the story doesn't hold <UNK> narrative from tarantino and style from stephen <UNK> doesn't help either because they don't blend with the film's <UNK> thin plot one may have complained a little less if the characters were more engaging but anil <UNK> grating <UNK> dialogue makes you want to <UNK> your <UNK> and saif ali khan <UNK> through the film <UNK> unable to find his feet kareena kapoor meanwhile queen of over the top delivery does a decent job but of course if tashan is <UNK> to some extent it's thanks to akshay <UNK> irresistible presence and his spontaneous approach to the character you cringe when he's <UNK> his <UNK> repeatedly and you <UNK> when he delivers those double meaning dialogues but not for a moment can you take your eyes off the screen when he's up there despite some good music from <UNK> <UNK> the songs seem like they're only <UNK> your misery well that's because tashan is a test of your patience in case you didn't know tashan means style i'm sorry to say this film has none
<START> an unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of the secret of <UNK> and the land before time this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon i remember this very well from my childhood it was funny and sad and very beautiful well it starts out a bit dark a dog who escaped the pound and gets killed by an old friend ends up in heaven and comes back but it becomes sweet when he befriends an <UNK> girl who can talk to animals some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons like the dream sequence of charlie but everything else was okay and the songs were fair a memorable role of burt reynolds and dom <UNK> i just love that guy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> of jaws the revenge may god rest her soul poor girl she didn't deserve to die but she is in heaven now all good people go to heaven overall this is a very good animated movie a don <UNK> classic enough to put anime and disney to shame recommended for the whole family and know this if you have the original video of this you'll find after the movie dom <UNK> has a very important and special message gotta love that guy <UNK>
<START> one of the finest pieces of television drama of the last decade throughout the five hours ones <UNK> and <UNK> are constantly challenged as it explores many <UNK> of modern day british society david <UNK> is as usual brilliant at first coming across as a heavy handed <UNK> in conflict with the heroine but then proving to be intelligent and caring as he works with her in <UNK> the truth i have never seen <UNK> jones before i believe she comes from the world of television <UNK> her performance was magnificent as she maintains her humour and <UNK> whilst trying to balance the demands of the case and the stress of caring for her mother i could go on and talk about every member of the cast who contributes to this magnificent drama but their efforts would mean little without such an absorbing script that constantly challenges your <UNK> about any of the characters it is <UNK> like this that <UNK> one's faith in television drama whilst at the same time making it almost impossible to settle for most of the garbage that is increasingly filling the <UNK>
<START> this is absolutely the dumbest movie i've ever seen what a waste of a splendid cast that's james <UNK> as the <UNK> playing deputy i could go on and on but i would obviously be spending more time on this review than anybody ever did on the script the only thing this movie is about is us vs them and how to <UNK> in <UNK> slapstick beyond any reasonable human <UNK> tolerance this is one of the 10 worst movies i have ever seen and i love james garner
<START> what hopkins does succeed at with this effort as writer and director is giving us a sense that we know absolutely no one in the film however perhaps <UNK> lies the problem his movie has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and drawn from very deep within but it's so <UNK> there are no characters we never know who anyone is thus there is no investment on our part br br it could be about a screenwriter <UNK> with his own characters is it maybe by that i don't mean that <UNK> is ambiguous i mean that there is no telling <UNK> film is an experiment on the face of it one could make the case that it is about a would be screenwriter who at the very moment of his meeting with fate realizes that life is hit and miss and or success is blind chance as he is <UNK> into a <UNK> of <UNK> between points in time dreams thoughts and reality nevertheless it is so <UNK> cerebral that it leaves no room for any hint of emotion even to the tiny quite <UNK> extent of allowing us a connection with its characters br br i didn't think the <UNK> and flamboyant school of shaky machine gun speed camera work and editing <UNK> me but <UNK> upon the film i am beginning to realize that it had a lot to do with it there are so many movies of the past decade in which the cuts or camera movement have sound effects as well as other atmosphere <UNK> technical <UNK> i suppose in this case it was justified in that its purpose was to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of dreams however i knew barely anything about <UNK> when watching it and i came out the same way and i just do not care because hopkins made no effort to make us care there are <UNK> movies and there are movies that sit in a <UNK> chair and <UNK> unaware of your presence <UNK> is the latter
<START> what the hell is in your minds this film sucks each minute i was getting more and more bored i <UNK> to watch the end because i hope something at least would at last happen but instead of that i got amazed how dull the end was treated what is this story about this bloody <UNK> how comes he doesn't die he is a bloody human being for god's sake a mere boy that killed his silly sister 15 years ago then what his stay on a psychiatric hospital made him immortal this film a <UNK> stupid it's a must of silliness i'm gonna <UNK> it right now to some silly guy who will understand this silly film
<START> as we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known the two leads always have to get together late in the third act i was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together a clue was given right from the start but you'll never realize it until the end it's a simple hook but it works it had to be you cover a lot of the usual ground but takes a fresh spin when ever possible i liked all the ny characters and i loved the locations it's a <UNK> of ny also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it so if you like a good old fashion romantic movie then this is for you
<START> this crime thriller is sort of like a film noir though changes the context from post war to cold war and has something relatively decent to say about humanity in pickup on south street policemen are good guys criminals are genuine guys and the only enemies are the <UNK> who are ultimately <UNK> from the good guys in that they are emotionally <UNK> driven by an actual care for their own worth as shown in the constant <UNK> in close ups that <UNK> the movie br br this movie revolves around characters the personalities in this film are rather unique and detailed skip the pick pocket who is able to stare down any danger and sometimes while going through their personal <UNK> moe the informer who is just trying to save up for a spectacular funeral but who manages to capture the hearts and respect of nearly all the other characters and the audience candy the ill named innocent girl who only thinks she's doing government work and doesn't fully comprehend the conspiracy she's involved with and joey the ex boyfriend evil <UNK> baddie who is trying to hide everything from everybody and ironically is the worst person at doing it throw in a bunch of very colorful supporting characters such as the guy with the <UNK> and the policemen and pickup on south street treats you to a <UNK> of personalities as they hunt down the mysterious and accidentally stolen <UNK> frames br br <UNK>
<START> fascinating <UNK> about a would be male hustler in new york city forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled con man extremely bleak examination of modern day moral and social decline extremely well directed by john <UNK> who never topped his work here and superbly acted by jon voight and dustin hoffman packs quite a punch overall yet the fantasy scenes some of which are played for a chuckle are mildly <UNK> as is the <UNK> drug party the relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental yet the filmmakers are careful not to get <UNK> and this gives the picture an edge it might not have had with a lesser director than <UNK> originally x rated in 1969 and the winner of the best picture oscar screenwriter <UNK> salt who adapted james leo <UNK> book and <UNK> also won <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> there is no way to avoid a comparison between the cat in the hat and the grinch who stole christmas so let's get that part out of the way first of all let me start by saying that i think grinch was an underrated and <UNK> film cat was well just awful br br jim carey was cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian and <UNK> commits to over the top outrageous characters mike myers fell back on his old bag of tricks br br why why why mike myers the kids could care less and the austin powers <UNK> isn't going to spy this film so what was the studio thinking br br the cat was also apparently related to linda <UNK> can we talk why a new york accent not entirely consistent with anything dr seuss has ever written myers was even allowed to sneak in his scottish <UNK> i wonder how many different voices the director and the studio tried to edit out of before they just gave in and said as long as you don't say <UNK> you can keep the accents meyers never seemed to find any sort of comfort either with the costume make up or dialogue br br the jokes what few there were were crude and age inappropriate when myers picks up a garden <UNK> and delivers to the camera dirty ho everything but the <UNK> shot was missing and even that wouldn't have helped br br the same folks who created <UNK> clearly had a hand in the creation of the town and the houses in <UNK> the sets and props were very appealing giving the viewer a much needed distraction from the bad writing direction and myers br br there was some fun to be had with alec baldwin and kelly preston <UNK> fanning was the only actor who seemed to be aware she was in a movie based on a dr seuss classic and stayed true to the genre br br call the <UNK> this cat should be <UNK> and never be allowed to <UNK> again please please no sequel
<START> very sweet pilot the show <UNK> of tim <UNK> better films edward <UNK> big fish charlie the chocolate factory the cinematography the narration the music the <UNK> sets all scream tim burton there has to be a connection or a strong influence i just haven't <UNK> enough to know where it is br br as i've seen in the <UNK> yes anna <UNK> is playing a poor man's <UNK> <UNK> every time i see her on the screen i see <UNK> don't get me wrong anna <UNK> does a great job her character is very sweet and lovable and you easily get attached to her it's more of a distraction that i keep thinking why didn't they get <UNK> <UNK> br br lee pace does a great job too i kept trying to remember where i knew him from and just looked it up <UNK> great short lived series from 2004 if you enjoy pushing daisies you must go rent <UNK> which is another brian fuller <UNK> <UNK> br br loved seeing <UNK> <UNK> world according to <UNK> and ellen greene little shop of horrors again two underrated character actresses that never fail to bring it with their performances
<START> i loved this movie chris <UNK> did an amazing job not only is he an incredible actor but he is gorgeous with an awesome <UNK> he did a great job on the delivery of his lines plus transformed into george better than <UNK> did a great performance for his first major roll this movie is full of hilarious scenes that every child will love my kids have watched this movie numerous times since we purchased the dvd the day it came out in addition to the movie the extras on the dvd are just as hilarious two thumbs up on this one i highly recommend it to everyone
<START> from the upper shelf of great classic books comes this masterful story written by pearl buck the book like the movie is called the good earth it relates the story of wang lung paul muni a simple chinese farmer who begins his day with a trip to the <UNK> <UNK> where he has taken a slave woman called o <UNK> <UNK> rainer and made her his wife almost from the beginning she begins to adapt to his kindness by saving a small <UNK> seed and <UNK> it near her new home during the following years o <UNK> proves her worth by <UNK> sharing her husband's <UNK> troubles and changing <UNK> through the passing years they raise a family and watch their simple household weather both feast and <UNK> indeed it's at the lowest point in their lives that each discovers the value of <UNK> loyalty and love with the changing times their growing family is both aided and threatened with friends and relatives like their uncle walter connolly who is a <UNK> and <UNK> but is <UNK> <UNK> wang has his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to advise and remind him of life's fragile and <UNK> nature two notable actors who make impressive appearances in this film are <UNK> luke who plays <UNK> elder son and phillip <UNK> who plays a <UNK> soldier the film is in black and white and is wonderfully adapted from the novel highly recommended for all audiences
<START> bette davis brings her full <UNK> of <UNK> to this miserable flop which is another variation on the hilariously <UNK> lovers theme sadly cagney and davis are truly <UNK> in acting styles and the mix is not simply <UNK> but <UNK> the only distinction in the film comes from eugene <UNK> who literally phones in his usual part as the <UNK> misunderstood dad jack <UNK> performance can only be described as an act of mayhem on the audience
<START> i see what the director was trying to do but he missed the mark the main actor was really good but the editing around his moments takes you out of it the camera work ie lighting and <UNK> is kind of amateur which i could forgive if the direction was more <UNK> but it wasn't the sound was a bit off and that takes you out of the film as well i see could see this director doing a little bit better in the future so not a total right off but don't expect a <UNK> movie nearly as good as 28 days later or anything keep your expectations low and you'll get more out of it at least it was only an hour and a half oh yeah and other than the lead the acting was pretty bad if you ask me but i'm a movie <UNK> so take that for what that's worth
<START> <UNK> out the <UNK> 30 all <UNK> our gang release schedule a tough winter features two <UNK> first <UNK> and mary ann home alone on a <UNK> day decide to make some <UNK> little <UNK> <UNK> the directions to mary ann from a radio cooking show the problem <UNK> <UNK> information from different shows and mary ann ends up putting soap in the mix funny moments occur when the rest of the gang shows up to pull the <UNK> and end up getting it all over the house br br the second storyline deals with <UNK> <UNK> a neighbor <UNK> of the gang and his interactions with the gang br br a tough winter to my knowledge has never been shown on television although it is available on home video the reason for this is the <UNK> <UNK> characterization which shows a <UNK> sly and slow moving character our gang producer hal roach called <UNK> a skilled comic and used this our gang entry as a pilot for a <UNK> comedy series that never saw the light of day understandably <UNK> characterization is offensive to many people today which explains why the film has been <UNK> br br although there are some funny moments both with <UNK> and the <UNK> a tough winter is a plodding and meandering effort if one positive came out of this film it was that the hal roach studios grew confident and experienced in making <UNK> the sound in the film is good and some of the sound effects used are very funny for this reason this film in part <UNK> the way for the excellent 1930 <UNK> our gang films br br 3 out of 10
<START> the form of the film is that of a suspense shocker there are surprises twists and turns <UNK> and <UNK> at times this is truly an edge of the seat film but it disappoints and disappoints severely br br the villain of the piece is not <UNK> his character does not hold together i refuse to spoil the film but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end br br the second major disappointment of the film is that finally it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film there is little <UNK> difference between this and one of the friday the 13th films not that every film need always be totally <UNK> but this film does <UNK> gore on occasion br br though the film features the magnificent sean connery even he does not measure up to his usual standard and often just seems to be walking through the <UNK>
<START> <UNK> parade is fascinating on so many levels there is no way the supposedly staged theater <UNK> could have been produced in any theater on earth of course think of the huge <UNK> and three story tall <UNK> for by a <UNK> for instance berkeley directed john garfield in they made me a criminal six years later and had the dead end kids singing by a <UNK> as they took their <UNK> br br shanghai <UNK> is the best production number in the picture it's a <UNK> of <UNK> warner bros sensibilities note the african guys mixed into the scene with white and asian prostitutes you would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were <UNK> on a train or <UNK> in a big house here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others i also get a thrill when the military dancers do a card section presentation of <UNK> image there's also the <UNK> eagle the <UNK> of the controversial national <UNK> administration of the new deal <UNK> was the new president and hopes were so high that he'd pull the nation out of the depression you'd never see something so working class oriented coming out of mgm of course warner bros <UNK> supported the <UNK> <UNK> by the f d r administration br br dear little miss ruby keeler was never better than she is playing the chinese hooker <UNK> she hardly even watches her feet as she dances which was one of her signature flaws br br the pre code stuff is fun the by a <UNK> number is wonderful in that regard the girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus <UNK> through times square with all its lights on the spread eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of <UNK> shots that would not be seen for 35 years in a few months the production code would eliminate such naughty pleasures
<START> karloff and lugosi together again this is one of those films that casual fans will pass over and tend not to appreciate as much it's not an all out horror film like the <UNK> previous two hits the black cat and the <UNK> but it is very worthy of <UNK> talents and is a fun film when re visited br br the invisible ray was directed by <UNK> <UNK> a director who mainly made westerns but curiously in these final days of the <UNK> reign at universal he found himself <UNK> this and the <UNK> final horror film <UNK> daughter both are crisp clean cut fantasies that are very light on horror content despite the fantastic elements br br just as lugosi went wild in the <UNK> much needs to be said of <UNK> <UNK> in the invisible ray the one aspect of the story that is particularly unsatisfying is that <UNK> character rukh acts so <UNK> before he is <UNK> by <UNK> x that there really isn't much of a change once he starts glowing this is very similar to the complaint people have about jack nicholson in the shining he's basically a loony right from the start there isn't any real transformation same here halfway through karloff simply has an added purpose for revenge in his mind i still enjoyed his performance though just as i did <UNK> over the top antics in the <UNK> br br meanwhile lugosi completely surprises you and gives a restrained and thoughtful turn as <UNK> rival in science dr <UNK> lugosi also has some of the best lines in the film including a memorable warning to the police trying to catch rukh of which i am in <UNK> with horror film writer john <UNK> on and if he rukh touches anyone the inspector <UNK> lugosi <UNK> replies in a way that only lugosi could deliver they die just as lugosi could be so off he could also be more perfect than any actor this is one of those moments br br therefore karloff and <UNK> interactions are all very good as we get the mad antics of karloff <UNK> off against the cool logic of lugosi karloff would go on to play similar mad scientists many times however one wishes lugosi would have gotten to play more straight roles like this one he only had one more chance <UNK> br br the invisible ray is a fun film and a real treat to the true karloff and lugosi fans it is one of those films that <UNK> on each viewing not because it is a masterpiece but because of the charisma and talent of its' stars and how this story <UNK> the darker more horrific <UNK> they had the special effects by the always innovative john <UNK> are terrific and the supporting actors are all adequate frances drake looks as beautiful as she did in mad love and plays a strong woman something seldom seen in classic horror films the scene in the end when karloff stalks her and she doesn't scream is one of the most haunting moments of the film a terrific fun film
<START> man i really wanted to like these shows i am starving for some good television and i applaud <UNK> for providing these <UNK> but sadly i am in the minority i guess when it comes to the cinematic stephen king as brilliant as king's writing is the irony is that it simply doesn't translate well to the screen big or small with few exceptions very few the king experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read many people would disagree with this but i'm sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed king story is but a pale memory of the one they read the reason is simple the average king story takes place in the mind <UNK> of the characters in the story he gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts their emotions and their sometimes <UNK> or unreal points of view in short king takes the reader places where you can't put a <UNK> camera as an audience watching the filmed king we're left with less than half the information than the reader has access to it's not too far a stretch to claim that one becomes a character in a king story they read whereas one is limited to petty <UNK> of that same character when filmed for as long as king writes hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word <UNK> without any regard to whether or not they should i don't blame the filmmakers for trying but it takes an incredible amount of talent and <UNK> to pull off the <UNK> stephen king adaptation that works the task is akin to turning lead into gold or some <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> oh well better luck next time
<START> with their no holds bar cruel offensive humor sure enough to offended anyone you would sure think this would be a laugh riot wrong <UNK> movie since open water don't be to surprised if you completely miss this movie upon release date as i'm sure it wont do very good at all at the box office this movie had a lot of potential but fell to little to short no enough character development awkward actors and the upside of this movie was nudity boobs amazing if i had to see this movie again i myself would go <UNK>
<START> i <UNK> down a few notes here on the first power lou <UNK> diamond <UNK> 1990 satanic serial killer <UNK> hell fest br br 1 lou diamond phillips was recently <UNK> for beating up his wife and may serve time in prison i only hope that he can find <UNK> prison wear to go off in style with one of the guilty pleasures of this movie is seeing his police detective clad in <UNK> designer <UNK> a <UNK> designer <UNK> suit and seeing his <UNK> month los angeles bachelor pad <UNK> with interior design by <UNK> van der <UNK> br br 2 leading lady <UNK> phillips has gorgeous <UNK> skin flowing red hair that always seems <UNK> even when <UNK> and amazing breasts that are hi <UNK> in the 2nd half of the film by a designer <UNK> <UNK> that sadly remains in place over her <UNK> even when she was being prepared to be sacrificed to satan at least back in the 1970's our demonic killers <UNK> their victims before doing away with them though there is something to be said for leaving a bit to the imagination by the final 10 minutes of the movie all i could think about is what her breasts probably would look like br br 3 professional <UNK> living in los angeles can afford 4 million dollar <UNK> on <UNK> drive <UNK> los angeles with a view that would make brad pitt decide that he was <UNK> it as a matter of fact the <UNK> used in this film looks exactly like the same one seen in david lynch's <UNK> dr which at least had the good sense to make it's <UNK> resident a successful movie director the only professional <UNK> i have encountered outside of this movie are all currently serving prison sentences for wire fraud br br 4 i forget his name but the villain in this movie is wonderful and his <UNK> it <UNK> buddy boy line could be the best overlooked movie phrase since thanks for the ride lady from <UNK> 2 br br 5 underneath major <UNK> cities there are huge <UNK> of <UNK> acid that will explode into huge <UNK> if someone throws a lit <UNK> lighter into them which is why major public <UNK> plants all have no smoking signs <UNK> all over them even though the idea of smoking around water being dangerous is of course preposterous and since <UNK> <UNK> need to be <UNK> filled with lighter fluid that can often <UNK> out and be absorbed by ones clothing the idea of a carrying one in the pocket of your <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> suit strikes me as being much more dangerous br br 6 the stunts in this movie are impressive to say the least and one of the fun things about watching it is remaining yourself that you are not viewing computer aided special effects but actual <UNK> <UNK> life and <UNK> to contribute to a movie that earned nearly universal bomb ratings from critics when released br br 7 movie <UNK> always <UNK> me here is a guy who has <UNK> into some <UNK> <UNK> for power and yet instead of using it to do something useful like making himself rich or causing fashion models to engage in free form sex with him he instead possesses bag ladies and have them <UNK> outside of people's apartments speaking of which here is a guy who is <UNK> can fly and is able to put his being inside of other people's bodies and yet he <UNK> star lou diamond phillips with an ordinary <UNK> in the film's conclusion yet does not have the good sense to inhabit arnold <UNK> or apollo <UNK> to ensure that he wins br br and on and on to be watched in the company of wise cracking friends while <UNK> beer you'll have fun so long as you <UNK> refuse to take it seriously br br 4 10
<START> ok where do we start with this little gem mutant slugs begin to take over a small new england town only one man can stop them and that man is mike brady now if that wasn't laughable enough stay tuned br br the footage of the slugs is what's known as stock footage no matter who the slugs attack or where they are the same shot of <UNK> of slugs <UNK> everywhere is shown keep in mind this <UNK> shot <UNK> at least half the movie br br the acting in the movie was knock down drag out steal your <UNK> punch your girlfriend kill your dog bad i'm sure there's worse but you're going to be hard pressed to find it the only gem was you guessed it mike brady he must have taken a few night classes at the <UNK> because he was the best in the bunch br br as for horror this film is not to be taken seriously there isn't horror they're slugs for crying out loud the entire rising action could have been avoided with a salt <UNK> or two only watch this film in a mst3k type environment otherwise i can see some major damage to the brain
<START> i don't even know where to begin on this one it's all about the family that has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a horror movie although this couldn't be a horror movie even if it tried ugh and i know that owen wilson is a better actor he needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie <UNK> <UNK> after all the man did co write bottle rocket and <UNK> he does have some talent also lily taylor should stick to indie films she has no place here finally catherine zeta jones should become a porn star there's no room in legitimate acting for her i'm serious one of the worst movies i've ever seen ever
<START> the movie is a real show of how <UNK> and selfish the upper society has become it has plenty of characters and each and every character is representing a different category of person no character is 100 good and moral unlike the heroes of all the typical indian movies and no character is 100 bad rather all are just different the movie is a very perfect mixture of emotions drama and entertainment for the very first time i liked a movie that has raised some social questions i would recommend all to see the movie <UNK> <UNK> is a journalist who covers those hip shaking parties of bollywood for the page 3 of the newspaper but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper but this is not all then it shows how she couldn't survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent children how brutally her voice is <UNK> even she is fired from the job then she couldn't find a job of crime reporter and has to do page 3 again not only her but a very very large number of characters are <UNK> in the movie and all gives different feeling while watching the movie i would really <UNK> the director for making such a great movie please do not afford to miss it
<START> i may be biased i am the author of the novel the hungry <UNK> club self published in 1994 the screenplay was written by my good friend and hungry bachelor fred <UNK> who was the inspiration for the character marlon in the film i couldn't be more pleased with the trailer i hope to see the film in its entirety and i will further comment but <UNK> fox who plays <UNK> <UNK> my character is stellar she carries the bulk of the emotional vehicles in fine form i couldn't have done better myself this looks like real people hardly formula driven and thankfully drives my statement against racial prejudice home <UNK> and heartfelt
<START> now here is a film that if made in australia would have easily been a comedy sadly and annoyingly here it is <UNK> and cheesy and <UNK> from <UNK> land how did the <UNK> <UNK> get it so wrong well mainly by being serious about a job so hilariously startling that nobody in their right mind could take seriously unless of course they were a nerdy lonely gay cliché but somehow cute or is that cliché <UNK> upon cliché no value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to gus van <UNK> <UNK> and with a title like the <UNK> how is it all such a lead weight well this auteur must have <UNK> mad that he didn't get to burt and boogie first that he had to make his own convoluted and undeveloped apart from the <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> theme left over from a faded streisand <UNK> we have only moody <UNK> and tv serial level storyline left the un necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly terrible as the film wanders off like the <UNK> into to desert and gets stuck there in oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar but actually hilarious film called <UNK> originally filmed as the <UNK> factory it too suffered from an auteur more awful than orson so they re filmed half of it got a ruthless tv editor to chop it up and down down to <UNK> minutes and hey <UNK> comedy tonight a lesson there in when bad films turn good by <UNK> up i guess the <UNK> <UNK> on release and after seeing it not perform i can understand why
<START> this movie is chilling reminder of bollywood being just a <UNK> of hollywood bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for <UNK> its industry br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of <UNK> and on the <UNK> will bring home an oscar it turned out to be rookie mistake br br even the idea of the title is inspired from the <UNK> kazan classic in the original brando is shown as raising <UNK> as symbolism of peace br br bollywood must move out of hollywood's shadow if it needs to be taken seriously
<START> a suspenseful thriller that bears some resemblance to deliverance as for scenery and setting there are also some very <UNK> shot scenes and good music although the <UNK> and sometimes seemingly <UNK> attitude of one of the characters is <UNK> to the situation although this is not a mayor problem it also poses interesting questions about <UNK> of revenge and limits of friendship br br
<START> 1st watched 12 7 2002 3 out of 10 <UNK> steve <UNK> typical mary kate ashley fare with a few more kisses it looks to me like the girls are getting pretty tired of this stuff and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to split up and go there own ways in this episode of their adventures they are <UNK> in rome for a <UNK> designer who puts them right into the <UNK> to learn what working hard is all about i guess besides the typical <UNK> with boys there is nothing much else except the rome scenario until about <UNK> way into the movie when it's finally revealed why they are getting fired then re hired then fired again then re hired again this is <UNK> made by people who don't understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it maybe the real world will be their next adventure if there is one even my kids didn't seem to care for this boring <UNK> in the make believe let's see they probably only have a couple of years till their legal adults we'll see what happens then
<START> if your a hard core freddy fan then you might not like it this seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series not much to see here the only reason it holds it self up is the back story on freddy br br the one thing that is always great in nightmare movies are the death scenes but the death scenes were very crappy in this the visual effects were great and the acting was ok but the back story was excellent basically freddy's story comes full circle in this br br i have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws br br 1 a nightmare on elm street 8 10 br br 2 freddy's dead the final nightmare 7 10 br br 3 a nightmare on elm street 4 the dream master 7 10 br br 4 a nightmare on elm street 3 the dream warriors 7 10 br br 5 a nightmare on elm street 5 the dream child 6 10 br br 6 a nightmare on elm street 2 freddy's revenge 3 10 br br i recommend it if you enjoy the series this is were freddy is fully explained but thats all there is next on my list wes <UNK> new nightmare br br 7 10
<START> this is a decent little flick made in <UNK> about a guy that is haunted by his past with his abusive <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and has grown up not so well <UNK> in fact he's absolutely <UNK> but tries not to be too obvious he's got an <UNK> too his own little demon angel that follow him around the demon never says a word but really doesn't have to and he's max <UNK> creepy let's just say that the angel pretty much <UNK> his <UNK> in this as eric is busy doing things that make him feel better like <UNK> people that he decides need it mostly beautiful young women this is a decent portrayal of madness and you're kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of what's going on but overall i watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest it's a little lacking in some areas but nothing i can really lay my finger on a decent effort and worth seeing if you like serial killer flicks
<START> the story is a little slow and a little stupid greta garbo doesn't look very good and i couldn't understand half the things she said because of her accent which was exaggerated for this role melvyn douglas meanwhile plays his normal unlikeable role and <UNK> bennett is just so so except for a couple of her screams which were funny br br on the plus side <UNK> young had the best role in the film i wish he had more lines as he disappeared in the second half of the story also it was interesting to see ruth gordon look so young i had only seen her in those crazy roles she played from the late '60s to the '80s and a whacked out old woman story wise the best part might have been the final few minutes when we see a stunt man doing amazing things on <UNK> pretending to be douglas falling down the <UNK> that was amazing and humorous footage br br overall i can see where this film <UNK> last was not a box office success it just drags too much going on and on about <UNK> it's an annoying story garbo knew it too and called it <UNK>
<START> nine minutes of psychedelic <UNK> often <UNK> abstract images are enough to drive anyone crazy i did spot a full frame eye at the start and later some birds <UNK> against other colors it was just not my cup of tea it's about <UNK> minutes too long
<START> be warned this movie tells lots of love stories without any <UNK> br br the only intention of this movie seems to be showing love in many different ways br br each story has only a few minutes so there is no development of characters and nearly no plot just an <UNK> idea of a plot the writer tried to build in turning points that aimed to surprise the viewer however that just didn't work out because you didn't get to know the characters in before or these jokes were just silly br br this is a movie about love that fails to reach your heart a dozen times or even more i don't know and i don't care
<START> i saw brother's shadow at the <UNK> film festival and found myself still thinking about it two days later the story of a <UNK> son scott cohen returning to his family's <UNK> furniture business after a <UNK> in jail it offers all the necessary qualities of a solid drama memorable characters sharp <UNK> dialog sensitive use of the camera by a filmmaker who thinks visually br br but more than that it presents something that is all too rare at the <UNK> these days the <UNK> vision of a mature sensibility the talent of director screenwriter todd s <UNK> seems to emerge full blown but we get the sense he like his protagonist has paid his <UNK> he knows how real people struggle in this world and he knows how we <UNK> to see or at least to experience <UNK> success yet <UNK> respects his audience too much to blow happy smoke up our rear ends in the end we see that <UNK> triumph doesn't lie in <UNK> or even in the <UNK> of his family but in the work he couldn't abandon if he tried br br it's an essential theme in a world and especially a movie industry that can't rise above the bottom line this film deserves a wide audience
<START> picked up the movie at the flea market for 4 bucks sure did get my <UNK> worth could care less about the hot babes but the animation just blew me away after a steady <UNK> of simpsons sorry mr <UNK> the best part facial expressions recommend multiple viewings with some cool tunes good friends and a couple of cold ones
<START> i actually didn't mind the <UNK> commercials the first 50 of so times i saw them and even found them to be a bit <UNK> and amusing but seriously this is the best thing that these people could come up with this show sucks it is bland and feels like watching an episode of the office with the characters disguised as <UNK> i know a lot of you will hate me for saying that but the office just does not do it for me okay i get it we have the poor <UNK> just trying to keep his nose clean and he has a crappy boss who hates him the pseudo intellectual who really just has a barely <UNK> intellect and the dopey one who just wants to be accepted but so what i have worked with these people and found them just as annoying in real life as i do on tv why would i want to waste another 1 <UNK> of my week watching more of those type <UNK> please call your parents and ask them if they dropped you on your head if after thinking about it you still <UNK> yourself into believing that this is entertainment
<START> clark gable plays a con man who <UNK> into the life of hard boiled dame jean harlow he tries to sucker her while she <UNK> him off with her tough gal attitude despite their cynicism and cons they fall in love when gable accidentally kills a man during a <UNK> he runs out leaving loyal harlow to women's prison where she discovers she's pregnant anita <UNK> and howard <UNK> <UNK> writing is excellent throughout with many well drawn and surprising characters including a jewish <UNK> woman <UNK> and a black woman <UNK> and her preacher father played with hardly a trace of stereotype gable and harlow show their <UNK> as actors adding telling nuances and quirks to their characters that send them beyond the typical gable and harlow roles and the direction is much better than you'd expect from sam wood one beautiful shot has harlow being <UNK> into the prison then led out into a surprisingly snowy <UNK> as the camera tracks after her this is one of the best of both the criminals in love and women's prison genres and has some of the best hard boiled dialogue ever written
<START> one of the finest musicals made one that is timeless and is worth seeing time and again delicious the acting especially by ron moody as fagin is superb costumes are exquisite even the <UNK> ones br br the two young <UNK> who play oliver and the <UNK> <UNK> are wonderfully talented oliver reed does a great job portraying bill sykes to where you can't help but hope he comes to a terrible end which he does br br the dancing is cleverly choreographed and is mesmerizing oliver can hold its own with the likes of my fair lady the sound of music <UNK> etc a film for the entire family
<START> i watched this with a growing sense of <UNK> why would god in the shape of ian hunter help these particular people in their attempted escape from <UNK> island and what was he doing there in the first place i mean i know god works in mysterious ways but helping thieves and murderers and prostitutes find redemption forgiveness and changes of heart in such a <UNK> location in any event it is hardly a likeable movie whatever gable had by way of charm is missing in this portrait of a thoroughly selfish man crawford is as endearing as ever she was i e to me not at all and the whole look of the film makes it seem as if it was made 10 years before compared to <UNK> films like <UNK> and mr deeds goes to town this looks <UNK>
<START> series 1 br br as the uk eagerly <UNK> the launch of series two of <UNK> series one which just finished showing here did not disappoint br br a group of over forty passengers struggle to cope after their plane crash landed into a deserted island they pray for rescue however as the days turn into weeks and the survivors explore the <UNK> that <UNK> them they begin to wonder whether they are alone br br admittedly the series has a hard time keeping up the pace after the explosive pilot episodes which <UNK> at the group a polar bear a giant <UNK> and the possibility of others on the island nevertheless the series manages to pick itself up after a few episodes and is outstanding by the final episode possibly the greatest thing about <UNK> is the fact that we visit each character's life before the crash in a series of flashbacks this gives us more insight and hence more suspense and excitement as the events unfold in the present br br ultimately this show is a superb combination of drama suspense and the supernatural it is quite simply <UNK> br br spoilers for season 1 follow br br series 2 br br after the cliffhanger that was the end of series 1 of <UNK> series 2 begins with our protagonists <UNK> deep into the heart of the phenomenon that is the <UNK> they discover a mysterious man who has a job to do meanwhile michael and <UNK> struggle to cope with the aftermath of what happened on the raft br br as the series progresses the viewers will be unable to bring themselves to turn off their television set as every episode of the series contains more twists than a curly <UNK> chocolate bar one of which introduces a whole host of new characters with every mystery solved with <UNK> five brand new ones seem to come out of the <UNK> after the <UNK> plot twist of the series it finally <UNK> on the viewer that it doesn't actually matter whether the plane crash survivors make it off the island however the stunning series finale answers just over half of those questions despite its anti climatic ending
<START> gender <UNK> <UNK> things up a bit for the x files this episode has an interesting premise a good story but an ending that is wanting gender <UNK> is also the x files debut for actor nicholas <UNK> better known as alex <UNK> in this episode he plays michael a man attacked by one of the <UNK> you need to see this episode just to see <UNK> <UNK> less than spectacular beginning an interesting thing about the <UNK> power of seduction when marty does it to his victims they become turned onto him her however when andrew <UNK> <UNK> she only because <UNK> and <UNK> and does not become attracted to andrew maybe it's because marty has more experience at it than andrew this episode reminds me of why it would sometimes be miserable to film up in british columbia throughout the episode it is so wet <UNK> and <UNK> it could not have been that much fun despite the disappointing ending gender <UNK> is still a decent episode to view
<START> it is ironic that during the <UNK> when douglas sirk was at his most successful in terms of audience appeal he was virtually ignored by the <UNK> he is now seen however as a director of <UNK> intellect who achieved his best work in <UNK> br br written on the wind is about the downfall of a <UNK> oil <UNK> surrounded by worthless reputation alcoholism and <UNK> it is about the twisted fatal connections between sex power and money br br stack draws a compelling portrait of a tormented drunken destroyed by frustration arrogance jealousy insanity and some deep <UNK> br br dorothy malone succeeds as an attractive woman with an excessive sexual <UNK> <UNK> herself for hudson and to other <UNK> in <UNK> her best line i'm filthy in one frantic scene we see her shaking <UNK> and <UNK> to a provocative <UNK> in another <UNK> alone over a model oil <UNK> at her father's <UNK> of excessive wealth and <UNK> <UNK> br br the frenetic atmosphere is both made <UNK> and <UNK> by <UNK> magnificent use of colors lights and careful use of <UNK>
<START> against all <UNK> is every bit the classic <UNK> it has all the elements the adventure fan could hope for and more for in this one the damsel in distress is well not really in distress as <UNK> stevens maureen o'hara is at her athletic best running her <UNK> through in <UNK> of the social <UNK> of the period anthony quinn rounds out the top three billed actors as the ruthless captain <UNK> <UNK> and proves to be a <UNK> and capable nemesis for brian hawke flynn for the classic adventure fan against all <UNK> is a must see while it may not be in quite the same league as some of errol <UNK> earlier work captain blood and the sea <UNK> for instance it is still a greatly entertaining romp
<START> this movie is why i found this website i couldn't find this movie anywhere else i am so glad we found it here we have seen it on tv before and wanted desperately to find it and buy and have several friends interested in buying it one other poster commented that it is was boring though i must say that it is not especially if you are a horse person you will love this movie the horses are awesome well trained and the movie is well done it is certainly one we will be <UNK> for our home dvd library we will be <UNK> it to our friends the bond made between man and horse in this film was so inspiring and made you want to spend more time with your horses this is certainly a movie that we will watch several times
<START> i could never remember the name of this show i use to watch it when i was 8 i remember staying up late when i wasn't suppose to just so i could watch this show it was the best show to me from what i remember of it it is still great this showed starred lucas black making him the first boy i ever had a crush on i am from the country therefore boys with an accent have no appeal to me but for him i would definitely make an exception which after seeing crazy in <UNK> friday night lights and tokyo drift you should see why he is a great actor and has been since he was a kid i miss this show and wish it would come back out if anyone ever sees where they are selling the season please email me <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> i watched this film many years ago and have searched for it ever since in my opinion although very raw it is very educational as to what the future can hold i enjoyed the movie and to this this day rate it very high sorry to all those that disagree but a movie should always be judged each to there own and in my opinion its great give it a go with all the <UNK> and test tube babies that are happening today who are we to judge this film this may be a <UNK> event of what is to become but there you go all the horrors of today are so far fetched even i laugh but this one gets me thinking and it scares me as a mother what if i was desperate after watching this movie i would think twice sorry but i love the movie make your own mind up don't watch the movie making just <UNK> the story and ask yourself this how far would you go for a child
<START> this is an entertaining look at the <UNK> as presented by johnny cash <UNK> in black of course who sings a lot and <UNK> a bit also if you like johnny cash this film is quite enjoyable also note the blonde depiction of jesus in this work just for fun try to think of five jewish men who have blonde hair anyway its a fun presentation of the greatest and most important story of all
<START> in the same tune as his <UNK> drums along the <UNK> john ford captures american history in a way that is fictional yet very believable henry fonda made three <UNK> films in this era with ford and all three are about a certain time and place with emphasis on the setting and the cultural surroundings in <UNK> <UNK> america is in full bloom with americans <UNK> for themselves against indians and other forces here ford shows us 19th century america a time when invention and creativity were beginning to <UNK> and this nation truly was becoming great amongst it all was a tall <UNK> young lawyer from <UNK> named <UNK> lincoln and this film <UNK> his life as a lawyer <UNK> the greatness he would later accomplish br br fonda is superb in this movie capturing the essence of what is considered to be the persona of lincoln although no one knows exactly what he was like then the sets and supporting cast also work well together and give a unique balance in ford's <UNK> of the american dream and its many forms this is not a film to be taken literally but rather <UNK> showing that lincoln was indeed warming up for the events in his life that were to creates his legacy we even get some scenes between him and a young mary todd and it is hard to see how they did end up together but that is not the point i believe this is simply a tribute to the greatness of lincoln widely regarded as the greatest american president his quiet and straightforward demeanor was rare then and would be today indeed our government surely needs more men like him
<START> when i first heard about down to earth i was pretty excited i'm a pretty big fan a chris rock he was especially hilarious in dogma but this film proved to be a disappointment chris <UNK> performance was not nearly as good as his past performances and the movie was just very badly directed as a whole br br first off chris rock he plays the entire movie as a <UNK> comedy routine obviously this works fine in the scenes where he's supposed to be doing <UNK> but in the rest of the movie it doesn't even when he's talking to one other character he seems to think he's trying to make a <UNK> of people laugh he has a few funny moments but they mostly come during the <UNK> scenes no wonder they decided to make his character a comedian as for the rest of the cast they're pretty much there just to give rock someone to talk to none of them stand out br br also the movie was poorly directed the movie has basically a one joke plot old white guy acting like a young black comedian while i prefer movies with more than one joke this still could have worked and been quite funny the problem was we saw too much of rock and not enough of the old white guy it's supposed to be funny because it's this white guy telling chris <UNK> jokes but for most of the time we just see chris rock so it's not nearly as funny the few scenes where they decide to show us the white guy talking like rock are in fact hilarious if he had been shown more the movie would have been a lot funnier br br overall a few moments of laughter can't make up for the fact that down to earth is poorly acted and poorly directed this one was a pretty big disappointment br br rating 4 10
<START> as a lesbian i am always on the <UNK> for films relating to gays lesbians however with this kind of crap out there it would be enough to <UNK> any audience br br i kept waiting for something to happen anything a story to develop or just for it to make some kind of sense neither occurred it was just meaningless scenes <UNK> in any way with anything the film failed to conveyed any kind of story or depth to the character br br after an hour or more of this nonsense i simply turned it off br br don't waste your time on this absurdity br br 1 star and it doesn't even deserve that
<START> kurt russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past <UNK> reno <UNK> robin williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as jack <UNK> he dropped the big pass in more ways than one br br you'll see some of the most <UNK> scenes ever put into one film as jack <UNK> at a rat reno poses and the call of the <UNK> goes out br br don't miss this classic that isn't scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played
<START> my friends usually can put up with a lot of hopeless movies but this one was too poor for us to even watch it to the end it was just so boring and unoriginal not even the hot girls that starred in this movie could keep me watching everything was just <UNK> and annoying br br the acting was at times good but more times bad the most annoying character in the whole movie that you just wanted to die would have to be the main characters best friend the more i saw him the more i wanted to smash my screen you know what fat ugly kid i'm talking about br br the plot has been done so many times before i think they should be <UNK> by other movie companies ok it is a good idea but thats all this movie had br br overall this movie can only be watched if by your self to save any abuse from your friends or if you have absolutely nothing better to do
<START> <UNK> this is pretty bad the play isn't great to begin with and the decision to transfer it to film does it no <UNK> especially as <UNK> doesn't decide how she wants to treat the <UNK> theatrical origins we get occasional <UNK> of an <UNK> theatre audience etc and has decided to go with a <UNK> editing style that is intended to keep reminding you that you're watching a film whereas in fact it only serves to remind you that you are watching a very poor film by a director who is overwhelmed by her material mira <UNK> central performance is breath <UNK> poor stage y and <UNK> it's as if she's playing the part via helena bonham <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> only <UNK> shaw delivers a performance of note and it may be that her theatrical <UNK> means that she is best able to handle the material but it's hard to watch a film for one performance alone even if that performance is as light truthful and entire as <UNK> ben kingsley turns in an average and <UNK> turn and diana <UNK> daughter rachel <UNK> plays her supporting role as just that sadly none of <UNK> magic has <UNK> off on his wife if this film is to be the evidence
<START> the main complaint with this film is the fact that i can not tell who is who no racism intended but these <UNK> look all the same i can tell somewhat of the story but heck thats about as far as it goes the peoples identities are not a mystery if they were a mystery i would care about them instead i wasn't them off the screen <UNK> br br tons of wide shots and silent <UNK> faces <UNK> this movie heck is it boring not only do i not know these people but they are just sitting there br br the production is typical chinese john woo terrible video with <UNK> scenes this looks only slightly better than andy <UNK> <UNK> killer which was a great movie you would think with a decent budget they could at least make it look like 90s hollywood i didn't know the chinese had these art house <UNK>
<START> after growing up in the gritty streets of detroit <UNK> and having friends who traveled to new york balls i fell into the lifestyle of being a house member i joined the house of <UNK> we adapted the same rules as most houses but we were professional crooks that would boost and commit credit card fraud to obtain the fabulous <UNK> and clothes we desired i even learned how to <UNK> the making of <UNK> and <UNK> license and cash them in over <UNK> states until a jealous queen called the secret service on me and i went to federal prison but i learned a lot from these queens in this movie and i highly recommend you watch it yourself you can even read about how i grew up in the houses here in detroit and the criminal activity we <UNK> in my book identity schemes is available on sale at amazon <UNK> com or at identity schemes <UNK> com but trust me it is a lot better than paris is burning because its a 2005 make
<START> reviewed at the <UNK> 12 2006 2nd screening at the paramount 1 theatre during the toronto international film festival the film had world premiered the day before at the <UNK> theatre <UNK> screening room br br the basic plot involves morgan freeman playing a one time popular actor who is on the <UNK> <UNK> of his career and who is taking on roles that may be beneath him but which he still does with a positive attitude knowing that he needs to pay the rent etc the <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> by his being a long time between roles with previous flicks in bargain dvd <UNK> and his being <UNK> by a not too sure of himself production assistant who drops freeman off at a local community market where he is going to do research for a role as supermarket manager he soon discovers the real life market is run by a iron <UNK> 10 items or less <UNK> line clerk played by paz vega when <UNK> ride never returns and vega needs help in <UNK> for an interview the circumstances cause them to join forces in a ride across town to get freeman back home and to get vega a job that'll get her on a more <UNK> mobile career path br br while the film was enjoyable it felt like it was still a sketch or a work in progress there were two extended musical sequences one with vega freeman teaching each other children's songs in the car one that literally plays like a paul simon music video that felt like padding to bring up the time and even then the film was only about 80 minutes long br br it's a good thing morgan freeman is as well liked as he is because without him this would have been too little sure it was funny in parts and paz vega is a delight as well but there was just not enough here to say it was a complete film br br they lost me when morgan freeman started talking about stopping the car to ask for directions and paz vega said she never does that who ever heard of a guy wanting to ask for directions and the woman saying no in the real world it's the exact opposite br br make sure you stay for the <UNK> in the credits the bit with a target store <UNK> teaching morgan freeman how to <UNK> sales is just hilarious an early bit where <UNK> <UNK> insists it is <UNK> voice on a books on tape reading was also pretty funny br br the director writer brad <UNK> and actress paz vega were there for a brief q a after the screening <UNK> answered one question saying that the script was not written specifically for morgan freeman and that once freeman took the role he actually changed very little of what was there quite a compliment for both <UNK> writing and also about how freeman can just slip into a role and make it feel entirely like he was born to play it
<START> just in time to capitalize on the long <UNK> movie version of <UNK> is the dvd release of this semi forgotten 1976 musical melodrama that also takes the rise of the <UNK> as its inspiration released five years before the broadway opening of <UNK> and partially set in the same period it has a <UNK> black cast and a story revolving around an up and coming girl group and that's where the resemblance basically ends written by joel <UNK> well before he became a big league director of mainstream studio product batman forever the phantom of the opera this movie seems <UNK> on the surface true to form however <UNK> <UNK> the storyline and character development by <UNK> an abundance of clichés and eye rolling one liners with little <UNK> for staging musical numbers sam <UNK> a highly regarded film editor but <UNK> director <UNK> the production like a low budget tv movie with a <UNK> episodic structure br br the story follows three harlem sisters sexy sister self righteous <UNK> and sweet <UNK> as they sing in the church choir meet smooth talking but well <UNK> boys <UNK> and <UNK> and then find their first taste of success as a singing group first as a <UNK> wearing <UNK> called the hearts and then as a <UNK> trio known as sister and the sisters but naturally there are problems beyond the silly name for the group sister gets involved with nasty drug dealer <UNK> <UNK> who beats her and turns her into a cocaine <UNK> <UNK> goes to prison for getting caught in a drug pick up for <UNK> <UNK> gets frustrated by failure and <UNK> turns to some jewish <UNK> for financial help <UNK> just gets plain fed up and poor little <UNK> has to decide what kind of future she wants a big plus is that r b great curtis <UNK> wrote the atmospheric songs some catchy and one look into your heart a real winner br br the solid cast does its best under the contrived circumstances <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> attempt to make sister a tragic figure is <UNK> by some of the ham <UNK> plot turns including a sad <UNK> <UNK> like turn at the mike before they hit it big on <UNK> tv philip michael thomas and <UNK> <UNK> portray <UNK> and <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> if not much credibility the best work comes from mary alice in a relatively silent turn as the girls' patient mother and a pre fame irene <UNK> who effortlessly exudes sincerity in the title role though her <UNK> and hair <UNK> should be shot for the hideous look she achieves in the final scene the dvd just comes with the original theatrical trailer complete with an <UNK> voice over by dj <UNK> <UNK> and a bonus cd of five of the film's songs performed not by the original cast but by <UNK> franklin off her 1976 recording of the soundtrack it's not a terrible movie just an interesting if lacking <UNK> that happens to cover the same ground as <UNK>
<START> this is simply put the worst movie i have ever seen it <UNK> from like 2 hours and the box art was totally misleading my friends and i rented it because we thought it would be a poor man's 300 you know to laugh at and make fun of no there is nothing funny about this movie only pain then the movie starts up and they are speaking some sort of different language we think <UNK> its just the beginning ' but no from there the movie <UNK> and becomes more of like a super boring book you had to read in grade school where nothing literally happens for hours and the battle scenes rival those of 2 kids fighting on a <UNK> <UNK> cinematography and this movie belongs in trash <UNK> movies like this will lead to the world we see in wall e which by the way was a good movie
<START> after <UNK> this was the second film for <UNK> <UNK> as a director till this movie was made there was no audience for documentaries in india this movie proved a point that a documentary can <UNK> the <UNK> of a commercial film without <UNK> its essence it was one of the successful movies in the year in which it was released this movie <UNK> against the big <UNK> of the bollywood <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in 1983 br br <UNK> in this movie acted more like a conscience of the hero whenever he <UNK> away or lost his <UNK> she was there to remind him she was not like an usual heroine to do the usual stuff of running around the trees and <UNK> at one time she even gave up her love when the hero's <UNK> touched the roof top br br there was another character in this movie which was played by <UNK> <UNK> contemporary <UNK> shah he played as an inspector turned alcoholic character the role conveyed the message of the end result of a honest cop who <UNK> the wrong side of the system which also gave the viewers a chance to <UNK> the hero's ending br br in his debut film <UNK> <UNK> captivated the audience with his cameo role which ultimately won him the best supporting actor by the <UNK> the cop in the movie was not a complete straight forward personality he was able to <UNK> to the system to an extent the anger which left half <UNK> continued in <UNK> <UNK> other film <UNK> even after two decades this movie is remembered just because of the director and the entire crew each one played their part par excellence
<START> this documentary begins with an interesting premise it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of jesus as is <UNK> believed is probably a myth sadly though after <UNK> us with this the movie completely shifts <UNK> and becomes little more than a non stop attack on christianity and pretty much focusing on the easy targets br br the writer director clearly has some issues with the church he is a former <UNK> christian and has some <UNK> anger and this film seems to be his form of release it'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded but as a whole the movie is disappointing
<START> i am a catholic taught in <UNK> <UNK> schools by nuns taught by <UNK> priests in high school college i am still a practicing catholic but would not be considered a good catholic in the <UNK> eyes because i don't believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to br br so back to the movie its bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the <UNK> of a female religious <UNK> there is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of diane keaton i never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good br br at first i thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate sister <UNK> emotional and intellectual <UNK> of faith but it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy the tragedy of loss of life besides the two former students the lives of the <UNK> babies the life of the <UNK> mom the tragedy of <UNK> authority over love of people the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in god this is what is wrong with today's islam and <UNK> <UNK> and christianity
<START> i don't want to go too far into detail because i can't really justify wasting much time on reviewing this film but i had to give an alternate opinion to hopefully help people avoid the movie the animation is <UNK> and the story <UNK> between boring pointless to extremely irritating the humor was completely lost on the audience and yes ghost in the shell fans this is not an action sci fi or anything like that its an attempt at slapstick comedy and the humor just did not work after being translated it was a total chore to watch this movie and horrible way for me to kick off the film fest especially considering how excited i was and how open i was for anything i wasn't expecting a ghost in the shell sequel but i was expecting something entertaining and it simply didn't achieve this <UNK> rent <UNK> journey instead
<START> i have a 19 month old and got really tired of watching care bears all the time rooney is a great dancer who cares if he is gay this guy must have been a <UNK> or something br br beats barney cant get the songs out of my head must stop singing <UNK> songs now br br must have 10 lines of text so i must continue what about when the say all the canadian stuff like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> too much she must be dutch br br knock knock who's there dee dee super <UNK> br br bus driver bob cannot dance take lessons from rooney
<START> let this film serve as the death <UNK> to the big twist films <UNK> out of the 1990s known in some circles as the <UNK> <UNK> syndrome this cinematic slight of hand has now been done to death by m night <UNK> and even ron howard used a variation in a beautiful mind however in revolver director guy ritchie known in some circles as mr madonna <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> in a far more <UNK> manner br br jason <UNK> with a highly questionable head of hair stars as jack green known to all as mr green he may or may not also be criminal mastermind mr gold or perhaps mr gold is an <UNK> spirit who can possess members of the underworld i'm not quite certain but i certainly don't care revolver is one of the most overwrought examples of cinematic excess i've had the <UNK> to endure in quite a long time witness the <UNK> time structure the painful jump cuts the <UNK> inner monologues and the painfully pretentious animated sequence this everything and the kitchen sink directing style makes quentin <UNK> <UNK> look <UNK> the cinematic smoke and mirrors only lead me to believe that ritchie was as bored telling this trite tale as i was watching it br br the film is filled with moments of revelation that are supposedly shocking but they only come as news to mr green i wanted to like green as i always enjoy <UNK> as a character who is two steps ahead of everyone else here though he struggles along like a <UNK> reader in a university english literature class his lack of wit is only matched by the lack of restraint shown by his nemesis <UNK> ray liotta <UNK> on scenery like a starving man at a <UNK> liotta <UNK> cries and <UNK> through the film in an embarrassing display of overacting and <UNK> print <UNK> br br there are no redeeming qualities to revolver it's yet another <UNK> faux <UNK> from ritchie and might even <UNK> his wretched remake of swept away as his worst film yet
<START> i saw this film last night about <UNK> minutes and don't know what kept me in my seat i guess i just expected a film with gere would have some value in it eventually but nothing of value ever came on the screen the story is a silly excuse to pile on shot after shot of bondage and torture there is not a character in the film that does anything like real life the cutting style relies on jump cuts mini flashbacks and <UNK> to give weight to this vapid setup of a gang of <UNK> apparently running free for years and surprise the leader is the victim of an executed killer i don't see how gere a <UNK> got involved in this violent sexist trash
<START> poor will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this <UNK> german tv <UNK> of his classic play it's obvious that very little money was spent on it a stage <UNK> a <UNK> and some randomly placed <UNK> pass off as a set the movie was <UNK> dubbed into english with the english voice actors occasionally <UNK> their lines the whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it and just where was <UNK> in this movie anyway mst3k gave this sorry production the treatment it <UNK> deserved br br to be or not to be i wish this movie never was in the first place
<START> generally i don't do <UNK> and if this site could i would give this movie 3 out of 10 meaning i really hated this movie i thought uwe <UNK> alone in the dark was the worst i've seen yet but at least i gave it a 2 5 out of 10 in my opinion stephen <UNK> shooting at nothing made me laugh so i <UNK> the ratings a bit hell if it was if compared to <UNK> <UNK> would win a oscar for best movie if they were competing br br now to the plot this movie is about the btk killer which is fine but they've could have done better the start looked ok but that's it i had to fast forward most of it because the <UNK> where boring i like killer movies and even if they suck they could still get some cool deaths i'm not a fancy movie expert but believe me he would have shot himself if did see this sorry for rambling but there's nothing good to say about it because it looks like someone took a camcorder and film this this thing of disaster uwe boll your movies are no longer on my list of worst movies ever this took the cake br br well sorry i couldn't explain the plot if there was one but that was the best i could now if you don't mind i'm going to crawl into a corner and move back and forth and reminding me of how bad this movie scared me for life ok not for life
<START> interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes <UNK> by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve it also <UNK> the issue how we tend to ignore those among us who are not as <UNK> and by doing this may miss out on a great opportunity the <UNK> of comedy also makes watching the film an enjoyable experience a must see for anyone who is interested in a <UNK> yet comical look at life i am eagerly looking forward to your next product hope that you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment excellent work <UNK>
<START> not long enough to be feature length and not abrupt enough to a short this thing exists for one reason to have a lesbian three way there are worse reasons to exist one sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie misty fits <UNK> into her outfit and is a very cocky girl and when people are so <UNK> with a game character like lara <UNK> that they make nude <UNK> of her you know that a soft core flick is set to explode unfortunately this is pretty pathetic especially the painfully fake sex scene between <UNK> and misty where you can see her hand is <UNK> air watch this if you just can't get enough of misty or ruby who makes a nice blonde and has <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ever
<START> as someone who has lived with cerebral <UNK> for over forty years i find this movie to be inspirational if someone with such a severe case of <UNK> as christie brown has can do so much then there's no reason that i couldn't achieve my own dreams daniel day lewis and brenda <UNK> both give awesome performances br br
<START> here's an excellent barbara stanwyck double bill on one disc the first movie and believe me the lesser of the two is <UNK> to please a lady 1950 in which she is paired with clark gable it is essentially a star vehicle with gable as usual <UNK> the film with his screen presence here he plays a macho racing driver who gets some bad press from feminist reporter stanwyck and the battle of the <UNK> begins of course after much <UNK> they eventually end up in each others arms and it all comes to a predictable and pleasing close a bit of a fluff of a move really but gable and stanwyck two icons of the golden age make it watchable br br but the real meat on this dvd is the second feature a marvellous and quite unknown little thriller called <UNK> produced by mgm in 1953 this is a wonderful little gem of a movie that hasn't dated one <UNK> here stanwyck plays the wife of barry sullivan and mother to their young son lee <UNK> on vacation on a deserted and remote mexican beach when suddenly tragedy strikes a <UNK> wooden <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sullivan under a heavy <UNK> and guess what yes the tide is coming in with not a soul in sight and unable to free him herself stanwyck sets off by car for assistance after driving some distance the only aid she can <UNK> comes from an <UNK> escaped convict ralph <UNK> who in return for his help wants more from her than money or a change of clothes i'll do anything to save my husband does she or doesn't she br br <UNK> runs away with the picture he turns in quite a brilliant performance once he comes into the film you simply cannot take your eyes off him an actor in the <UNK> brando style he surprisingly never made much of his career in films although he gave splendid performances as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> officer in the outstanding mann stewart western naked <UNK> 1953 and as one of the doomed <UNK> french troopers in stanley kubrick's powerful <UNK> drama paths of glory 1957 his only real claim to fame was as mike hammer in mickey <UNK> kiss me deadly in 1955 his performance in <UNK> should have done wonders for him but he had only a so so career in films he died in 1988 br br because of this release <UNK> can now proudly take its <UNK> place as a classic noir a memorable taut and exciting thriller thanks to fine performances tight direction by john <UNK> the crisp <UNK> cinematography of victor <UNK> and an atmospheric score by <UNK> <UNK> extras however are no great shakes except for a radio version of <UNK> and trailers for both movies br br this disc is also part of a barbara stanwyck box set celebrating her <UNK> hard to believe that the lady would be over 100 years old if she was still around br br <UNK> an mgm winner
<START> flat soulless computer images on less than astonishing backgrounds <UNK> a horribly predictable story in this film absolutely nothing takes you by surprise you can even tell when the bryan adams <UNK> are going to come in which are always at the wrong time br br the main character spirit the horse is given an annoying voice when he <UNK> what is happening the narration is not needed though as everything happening is really obvious you can even tell what the horses are saying although all they do is <UNK> which would be good but all the horses make exactly the same sounds one for warning one for sorrow one for laughing etc there is no variation between the <UNK> voices br br young kids might like this film though it's <UNK> enough for a family to sit down and watch and there's little danger of anyone being frightened if you have nothing else to do and want to watch a film with your kids this isn't a bad choice br br but otherwise this isn't recommended
<START> this movie wastes virtually every actor's talents in what could best be <UNK> called a <UNK> br br despite it's action packed <UNK> <UNK> opening it is all downhill from there with plenty of stereotypes and unlikely situations following each other until you try to choke yourself on your popcorn br br there are so many dead end story lines in this movie i was guessing at one point it was made by <UNK> together a <UNK> tv series br br <UNK> mexican drug lord role is laughable and his <UNK> <UNK> right out of a 1970's quinn martin cop show <UNK> character is wooden and gives us no reason to believe he actually fell in love with <UNK> wife nor are we convincingly led to believe the wife is <UNK> for <UNK> and will jump the first hot body coming along br br definitely a <UNK> movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved
<START> this movie will promote the improvement of the mind read a book it's incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make i've seen b movies before but the c movie has just been invented i didn't think i would ever enjoy power rangers since my kids stopped watching but i found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into knights high school productions are better than this and the actors involved should <UNK> this from their resume embarrassment is one of many <UNK> that come to mind my roommate who loves these types of movies even turned it off now that has to really tell you something if you watch this movie and like it i will pray for you
<START> really really bad slasher movie a psychotic person escapes from an asylum three years later he kills a <UNK> professor end of scene one <UNK> yesterday later hey that's what the title card said a new <UNK> professor is at the school she makes friends with another female <UNK> professor who works there and starts dating another professor the students are all bored as are we br br there are a number of title cards <UNK> how much time has passed scenes are pretty short and cut to different characters somewhere else making for little progression of any kind a lot of scenes involve characters walking and talking or sitting and talking and serve little purpose despite the passage of time many of the characters are always wearing the same clothing sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time we ask ourselves how long has that body been there and also at least one of the dead people don't seem to have been missed by others br br the killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the breast another by stabbing him in the <UNK> and another by <UNK> her <UNK> is his knife <UNK> or something br br the video box cover has a <UNK> there aren't any in the movie the rear cover has a photo of someone in a <UNK> cap and <UNK> menacing a group of women in a <UNK> room the central <UNK> in the photo is in the movie but nobody ever wears such an outfit and there is no such scene the killer is strictly one on one
<START> i realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title this movie is not primarily about the act of riding giants but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport riding giants to change the emphasis br br in my teens i lived a block from the <UNK> one of the hardest breaking and best <UNK> spots in the world i've been out in 15 to 18 foot surf and have ridden and been <UNK> by 10 and 12 foot waves on many occasions that experience is why i am in complete awe of the surfers in this film the idea that jeff clark to all appearances a normal mortal could get away with riding <UNK> by himself for over a decade is beyond my grasp the first safety rule of any water sport is never surf dive swim by yourself he went where sane people would not and lived to tell about it i wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left br br in the world of warm water the first shot of the waves at jaws always makes the skin <UNK> over my entire body these are not just scary waves these are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> waves when we see <UNK> hamilton not only surviving 40 to 60 foot waves i can hardly type those numbers but actually working the faces like a fun day at <UNK> i'm blown away there is a dedication and focus in big wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world br br this a great film i gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it <UNK> to mention that there are great big wave riders in the world outside the hamilton <UNK> crew and i think they deserved mention <UNK> in ken <UNK> at outside <UNK> <UNK> and a 10 it is
<START> the acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay it was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes the ending was even worse everyone kept dying but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly ok they did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had etc the movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline the only reason i give this 3 10 is that i kind of feel bad for the young actors they needed better <UNK> they could have really made this an ok film but the screenplay and acting failed miserably
<START> lion king 1 1 2 is the funniest non theatrical release from disney i recently saw this movie again after not seeing it in many years i remember first time i saw it i didn't had any expectations at all and were pleasantly surprised by this watchable and highly entertaining movie br br is it better than <UNK> pride in many ways yes though <UNK> pride wasn't exactly bad it did suffer some problems lack of an good script and bad characterizations which made impact of what otherwise a okay film br br anyway it's nice to see timon and <UNK> personalities <UNK> again in the way that we or certainly me loved about them in this film in <UNK> pride they were completely annoying and i didn't liked the timon and pumbaa series neither br br this film could easily have been a stupid one but fortunately the filmmakers didn't took the wrong turn and instead focused to make this film at times extremely hilarious there are a few jokes that adults can enjoy on their own the score is quite good there are two new songs which are catchy and two new characters <UNK> mom voiced by recognizable <UNK> <UNK> julie <UNK> and uncle max which are enjoyable the friendship between timon and pumbaa are <UNK> portrayed the emotional scenes are well integrated in the comical story and doesn't feel out of place which it could have easily done especially in comedies br br but is there something that <UNK> this picture from getting 10 votes from me yes there is although they fortunately doesn't impact too much but i'll mention them 1 many of the scenes from the first film are used in this one personally it was weird to see the old scenes integrated with the new ones br br 2 during the climax some of the jokes becomes lame br br 3 <UNK> this is <UNK> story and although the filmmakers try to <UNK> his tale with <UNK> it makes the screenplay feel a little rushed at times br br but hey those details doesn't impact this otherwise amusing movie it is the only really acceptable disney sequel which should be in every movie collection
<START> spoilers br br i was very disappointed in <UNK> <UNK> joy i had been waiting a really long time to see it and i finally got the chance when it re aired <UNK> night on hallmark i love the first three love movies but this one was nothing like i thought it was going to be the whole movie was sad and depressing there were way to many goofs and the editing was very poor to many scenes out of context i also think the death of baby kathy happened way to soon and <UNK> appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit it seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there they were all lacking emotion there seemed to be no interaction between <UNK> and willie at all br br i think the script writers should have went more by the book it seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or clark getting hurt because of it and i think <UNK> and <UNK> reactions to <UNK> death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard br br out of the four movies that have been made so far i'd have to say that <UNK> <UNK> joy is my least favorite i hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if <UNK> character is in them i hope he's got a bigger part and i hope his part isn't so bland i also hope there is more of <UNK> and cookie and maybe even marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next
<START> the movie starts out with some <UNK> text which takes nearly five minutes it gives the basic summary of what is going on this could have easily been done with acting but instead you get a <UNK> text effect soon after you are <UNK> with characters that you learn a little about keep in mind this is all you will learn about them the plot starts to get off the ground and then crashes through the entire movie not only does the plot change but you might even ask yourself if your watching the same movie i have never played the video game but know people who have from my understanding whether you've played the game or not this movie does not get any better save your money unless you like to sleep at the theaters
<START> i felt that the movie was dry very disappointing no plot kept waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone a <UNK> of money one of <UNK> williams worst films if you don't believe me wait a few months it will be out on dvd because that seems to be a pattern for movies that don't do well in the theaters are out as <UNK> before the year is over this is one you will not want to see or say why did i spend my money on that plus for it being such a new movie there were only 8 people in the watching it this was on a friday night the 9 50 showing i also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake when they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were saying
<START> all this talk about this being a bad movie is nonsense as a matter of fact this is the best movie i've ever seen it's an excellent story and the actors in the movie are some of the best i would not give criticism to any of the actors that movie is the best and it will always stay that way
<START> the seventh sign has a great opening hook as the israeli <UNK> force come across a terrorist base this is the type of hook that is a must when writing a script it grabs the reader audience and the introduction of david <UNK> as he <UNK> a room from <UNK> and russell <UNK> <UNK> the point that this is a man who s not who he says he is however after the great opening third i found the rest of the movie confusing and <UNK> with a large number of <UNK> and <UNK> t all that different from <UNK> other supernatural thrillers that i <UNK> seen
<START> what a <UNK> this turned out to be at one time much earlier in her career linda <UNK> was one of my favorites no great shakes as an actress but very beautiful and pleasant particularly in films like the mark of zorro and blood and sand but when i saw this monstrosity the memories of her golden days faded quickly the story is unbelievable and <UNK> the acting second rate the supporting cast <UNK> i cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to <UNK> hunter and donald gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked added to this was the terrible photography and i am not just referring to the color everyone associated with this must have <UNK> whenever it was shown
<START> i'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there's almost no plot anyway i've seen several reviewers call <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> film or even a feminist statement and i just have to <UNK> in on the <UNK> <UNK> of these claims br br first of all what do we see on the cover of this movie that's right a <UNK> woman's behind whether it was <UNK> attempt to make an anti rape statement and i absolutely don't believe it was is entirely beside the point the film is marketing sex and the <UNK> of sexual assault and the material is so graphic everything but actual <UNK> is shown that no one but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it br br the rape s in the film is uncomfortable brutal and hard to watch there's something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes none there was also little character development of the victim and only one of the <UNK> is slightly developed mere moments before he's murdered so the scene isn't at all engaging on an emotional level really it's just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies <UNK> is associated with on imdb <UNK> cannibal <UNK> etc that it <UNK> only the exploitation crowd br br finally a few reviewers have <UNK> <UNK> so called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack but considering how inept everything else in the film is acting script etc i suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally <UNK> a camera and let his porn caliber actors do their thing br br i'm not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of <UNK> i'm all for exploitation horror and love video <UNK> in fact i'm giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the <UNK> so much further than some other films however it's also poorly made and after the rape occurs just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho hum mostly gore less murders and wait for the credits to roll br br this is probably worth watching once if you're a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but i'm telling you the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation
<START> <UNK> our mother 2008 is a poetic and sublime beauty from japan a real <UNK> i had heard great reviews for the film and rented it from netflix am i glad i did in many ways this film reminded me of the old style of japanese classic film making from the 1940's and 1950's that i've come to love so much such as seen in <UNK> <UNK> pictures the title credits even begin in the same way with the japanese letters characters in red against neutral color <UNK> material i immediately thought this director loves <UNK> the same style was used too mostly <UNK> sets with only a few <UNK> scenes even a couple of <UNK> shots as roger ebert calls them the strength of the film is built on the love of the characters for one another br br the story follows the lives of a japanese family before and during and after world war two the mother takes care of her growing girls the best she can after the father a university professor is arrested for anti war <UNK> he's never freed and only has a few brief <UNK> with his wife in prison before he dies of <UNK> and disease meanwhile a former student of the professor comes by often to help take care of the mother and two girls he begins to fall in love with the mother and is a substitute father for the two girls but war starts and he's <UNK> and they have to say an abrupt farewell will they ever express their love for one another will he ever return from the war br br there is so much heart and gentle spirit in the performance of the lead actress <UNK> <UNK> she's almost a madonna type she's so beautiful big <UNK> eyes and flawless skin the actor who plays the student is phenomenal as well his name is <UNK> <UNK> what a sensitive performance there is no macho in him at all he's gentle and kind i'd certainly love to see both of these two in other movies i think i'll check to see what's available for them the two little child actresses are wonderful too br br the film is just released on <UNK> dvd for american audiences with very easy to read english subtitles i gave it a 10 out of 10 on the imdb i cried almost as much as with the japanese film classic twenty four eyes 1954 don't miss this film
<START> first and foremost i loved the novel by ray <UNK> it's the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later it was one of his best books with you know <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> wine i as just hoping that this movie would be all right it had lots of chances with a great cast like jason <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> even wrote the script himself and on top of all that it has pam <UNK> br br how could it fail br br there may be spoilers within br br first of all it was <UNK> down much of the horror from the book was lost as <UNK> must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum all the visuals from the book gone everything that made you <UNK> gone br br and then there's the acting like a lot of movies that disney threw out in the 80s the kids in this movie cannot act and this <UNK> me a lot neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10 their strong friendship wasn't addressed it was more like they were <UNK> br br you'd think jason <UNK> and jonathan <UNK> could pull this off in their roles of mr <UNK> and mr dark but here it's like they just don't care all they want to do is somehow pay off some <UNK> or something this is far from being some of their best performances br br pam <UNK> was fine as the witch but the <UNK> of the dust witch herself wasn't well pulled off she's a lot less evil and doesn't have the presence as she did in the book br br and everything that was left out of the book the <UNK> night chase the <UNK> of <UNK> house the real death of mr dark what happened to mr <UNK> on the merry go round the fate of the <UNK> rod salesman the real death of the witch and oh so much more br br and the special effects were bad even for the 80s the merry go round of doom for one thing with the <UNK> horses going around wasn't really creepy and that weird green <UNK> that really had nothing to do with anything br br i could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel but it makes blood <UNK> don't see this movie but read the book it's a classic of <UNK>
<START> jason lee does his best to bring fun to a silly situation but the movie just fails to make a connect br br perhaps because julia stiles character seems awkward as the conniving and sexy soon to be cousin in law br br maybe it is because she and <UNK> <UNK> characters should have been cast the opposite way <UNK> blair seems more conniving than julia would be br br either way this movie is yet another hollywood <UNK> of a possibly real world situation that being getting caught with your pants out at your bachelor party not <UNK> your cousin which while having promise fails to deliver br br there are some laughs to be sure and the cast even if miscast do their best with sub grade material which doesn't <UNK> its raunchy topic so instead of getting a successful <UNK> fest ie animal house or american pie we are left with a middle ground of part humor and part stupidity ala <UNK> 2 or something
<START> extremely disappointing film based on the james <UNK> novel br br what was even worse was marlon <UNK> performance his southern <UNK> was ridiculous i found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to <UNK> brando so great in previous films was reduced here to a laughing stock <UNK> power in witness for the <UNK> should have been nominated for best actor instead of brando here br br the film dealing with racism dealt with the u s <UNK> attempt to avoid <UNK> between u s soldiers and japanese women br br brando was stone faced throughout the movie his moving from anti these relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an asian woman his emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could <UNK> such new views br br only the lord knows why red buttons and <UNK> <UNK> received supporting oscars for their performances nothing about either performance was equally impressive <UNK> appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part a better performance in this film was done by <UNK> <UNK> who did nicely as <UNK> love interest she showed great emotion as the anti american who found love with the brando character her face was <UNK> with the <UNK> she had for losing her father and brother in world war 11 she realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living br br martha scott went from the <UNK> mother <UNK> in the ten <UNK> to the <UNK> mother of <UNK> love interest at first her performance together with the one of <UNK> <UNK> was wasted patricia <UNK> as <UNK> first love showed depth and conviction in her performance
<START> i give this movie 7 out of 10 because the villains were interesting in their roles and the unknown batwoman creates an interesting guess who game the movie however needs more robin in it he appeared in the movie in the beginning and <UNK> throughout the rest i always thought the new animated series did little justice to the neat new robin character let alone <UNK> this movie just continues that bad tradition the movie spends too much time on bruce wayne and his romance which wouldn't be so bad in one movie if the romance wasn't so unbelievable it is still a good movie if you are a batman fan and i would recommend watching it
<START> good movies are original some leave a message or touch you in a certain way but sometimes you're not in the mood for that br br i wanted something simple no thinking just plain action when i watched this one it started of good and was quite entertaining so why a bad review well in the end the movie lost it's credibility the storyline wasn't that cheesy at all the action was not too special but overall good acting was ok so more than enough to satisfy my needs but all got ruined because things happened that were over the top and it left me with a bad feeling they should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the no thinking just plain action category so in conclusion if you know you'll get irritated because things are happening that seem completely illogical don't watch otherwise i'd say go ahead
<START> this was one of the best movies i have seen the movie relates to real life and how drugs can play a major part although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget i found it to be <UNK> to watch br br some may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction however when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters there is no direction is life i feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme <UNK> br br most of the cast are <UNK> to the industry however they all pulled it off very well everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriately br br i think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be <UNK> out of control this movie might just scare them enough to change their ways
<START> notice i have given this 1 star if the option been given i would have given this zero as i put this dvd into my tv and sat down on my couch i was expecting some of the worst film making at its finest i looked this movie up on imdb and saw that it was the worst rated movie so i guess i came into it critical of every mistake but it didn't prepare me for the crap that was about to <UNK> from my television screen br br the box makes this movie out to look <UNK> ok at best do not let that fool you this movie needs to be banned from all shelves around the world br br the best way i can describe this movie is like porn but without any sex scenes in it the acting if you can call it that the plot so many holes must look like swiss cheese and the special effects really are just terrible br br please do not be like me and rent this movie because you think it will be funny to watch br br in the end i'm not saying i can make a better movie than this but i am thinking it
<START> i know nothing of the <UNK> so can not comment on it's accuracy to that story however as a stand alone film i found this very boring the battle scenes tried to be large and spectacular but they were just obvious cgi br br the acting is poor and no doubt brad pitt was cast just to attract the ladies but he does not make a good warrior too pretty i am afraid br br good points are is the design this film does look good with the landscape and castle buildings walls impressive i do like a film that at least tries to get the characters accents true but this film just seems to ignore it completely we hear american scottish english anything but what you might expect for a film about an ancient eastern <UNK> br br all in all i do not recommend this film for a family sit down it is too long and the young will get bored br br for adults it is ok if you don't care about the lack realism
<START> the film <UNK> pick up simply does not work see it if you are at all interested in <UNK> leonard or john <UNK> or anyone in the terrific cast especially john glover who's admittedly brilliant but the book a slow burning noir thriller with lots of pulp should have translated into an oscar <UNK> film instead of this dud that couldn't figure out whether it should <UNK> portray the hard boiled gritty crime story of the book or <UNK> for a 1980s <UNK> shoot em up spree shifting the scene from the original locale in the book detroit an area where leonard has <UNK> for years and knows very well to los angeles makes for a substantial problem that leonard tries to fix in his script but ultimately can't it was for example a clever device making <UNK> wife a city <UNK> she had no job in the book if you think about it that's the only way you could ever <UNK> blackmail someone in a sex crazed city like 1980s los angeles for adultery or any type of potential sex scandal even then it's more plausible in a more conservative eastern state like <UNK> to believe that a its tiny porno industry is a sleazy money <UNK> hell where three losers could desperately set up a not so stupid upper middle class fellow going through a mid life crisis and b adultery alone might be something you could blackmail someone with if their <UNK> careers and old fashioned wives couldn't handle the shock as <UNK> ron jeremy will tell you 1980s los angeles was a colorful stylish porno <UNK> more like the movie boogie nights than <UNK> dark shadowy world of <UNK> tourist <UNK> <UNK> apartments and drug deals in depressed urban <UNK> then again los angeles could be the backdrop of such a tale if one arranged the scenery more carefully there are still plenty of dark <UNK> and <UNK> there unfortunately roy <UNK> harry mitchell comes off in the film as a sexy handsome <UNK> dancing through his problems without even working up a sweat in the book he was <UNK> off a jerk union official while struggling with a business that was failing he also had a <UNK> in the closet during the war involving friendly fire that he was responsible for but never appeared to come to grips with <UNK> <UNK> stories usually have a central image involving a bizarre <UNK> between criminal and law <UNK> citizen here harry mitchell sitting in his office with his <UNK> alan <UNK> turning over his financial books to him and <UNK> a more practical <UNK> makes for such a central image <UNK> <UNK> plays the scene with convincing intelligence but <UNK> portrays the victim here as a cocky good guy in charge of the situation as if he were more a rambo with an m 16 than the <UNK> barely staying <UNK> as his world <UNK> around him <UNK> pick up ends with one of the worst throwaway conclusions ever considering all the thought that went into the original story and then the film <UNK> <UNK> inside <UNK> <UNK> and blowing him up with <UNK> band music <UNK> out along with a sadistic monologue by mitchell plays to an audience wanting the sweet revenge conclusion of a chuck norris movie not the intelligent balanced world of <UNK> book where mitchell barely escapes in the end and the conflict between good and evil could easily go either way i left the theater shaking my head and depressed what a waste of talent

<START> this movie is horrible the acting is a waste basket no crying no action hopeless songs though the scenery is great i have always wanted to go to <UNK> br br anyway as for saif you'd expect a great performance but even he let down the people br br akshay kumar recognized as the <UNK> of bollywood and the voice of <UNK> he was sensational in this movie for only this performance <UNK> should introduce another award the <UNK> award for the worst performance by the way the <UNK> should be a toilet seat br br kareena kapoor she first of all is not comparable to her sister <UNK> in acting in looks or in body she now wants to prove to herself that she surpasses her she comes into this movie wearing <UNK> and tank tops and short shorts i really wonder why saif ali khan is letting his wife to be dress like that but she must've impressed some people dressing like that and if you ask how then consider every man is having an <UNK> watching this movie they are dreaming of having kareena kapoor in bed naked with a <UNK> including me personally i think that she dressed like a whore but i really liked it br br i am forced to give it a 1 10 but i'd really give this movie a 0 10 an <UNK> film
<START> i purchased the blood castle dvd on ebay for a few bucks not knowing what it was and all i can say is that i wasn't disappointed with this purchase blood castle is one of those trashy european horror films that has almost no redeeming quality except for being thoroughly entertaining for all the bad reasons the opening alone was worth the price of the dvd our heroine dr <UNK> arrives at the castle where she's supposed to help a scientist baron <UNK> who does experiments on dead <UNK> on her way to the castle 1 a man tries to rape <UNK> 2 the <UNK> <UNK> fights with her 3 the maid wants her dead 4 and finally baron <UNK> nearly <UNK> on her and wants her out the next day hmm something tells me she's not welcome with such a miserable arrival you'd think <UNK> would leave the place in a ny minute but no like so many great trashy films our <UNK> heroine decides to stay put and even enjoys a <UNK> dinner with the grumpy baron on that same <UNK> day the intro is so over the top trashy it's even greater than the memorable first few minutes of that canadian film junior that i knew i was going to enjoy this br br but the fun doesn't end there <UNK> is repeatedly drugged whenever she goes to bed at night only to wake up from <UNK> naked bound and tortured in mild sessions of s m by an unseen man even after experiencing these <UNK> s m sessions <UNK> stays at the castle <UNK> convinced by the angry baron that what she's experiencing are nothing more than dreams to be expected even after being treated so badly from the get go <UNK> falls in love with the baron <UNK> completely <UNK> anything negative about him including the obvious fact that the <UNK> baron is popular with the young ladies every women at the castle it seems only women work there is in love with the miserable <UNK> who doesn't mind taking advantage of the pretty young things things get even <UNK> as someone <UNK> around the estate and kills and has been killing women basically the <UNK> physically <UNK> brother <UNK> is responsible for everything in a very long <UNK> scene the brother warns the baron he should not get too involved with <UNK> or he'll suffer the consequences so what do the baron and <UNK> do about this well they get married of course during the very brief marriage ceremony the baron is shot by one of the angry locals father of one of the dead girls but all of this doesn't <UNK> <UNK> who amidst all the dead young ladies and torture surrounding them <UNK> <UNK> the hurt baron that it's just a flesh wound and the two can go on and enjoy their honeymoon at the castle where the killer rapist <UNK> brother is the whole thing quickly <UNK> into a nightmarish love triangle of sorts between <UNK> the baron and <UNK> blame it all on love br br anyway you get the idea subtle it's not almost everything is over the top ridiculous in this film and when it's not <UNK> such as the predictable climax things get a tad boring but for most of the film the director or writer <UNK> in one <UNK> trashy moment after another i really love these kind of films everything as subtle as being hit over the head with a <UNK> and populated by characters behaving <UNK> even those who made the <UNK> dvd realize this and when you go to the scene selection section we hear one of the funniest bits of dialogue from the dubbed movie <UNK> endlessly br br the production values are beautifully <UNK> the opening and closing credits with those <UNK> and red <UNK> ah a <UNK> of class the music sounds sometimes like something from a tim burton film which only adds to the <UNK> of it all and <UNK> to these kind of films when the young ladies take off their clothes they just beg to be killed br br as a standard film i rate this a 2 but as a it's so bad it's good film i rate it a solid 8 stars if you enjoy trashy films please watch this one it's a must see the only thing left for me to <UNK> about it what would it have taken for that woman to get out of that freaking castle

<START> we all have seen some <UNK> epics in our times but this one really tops them all the movie is so long and so slow that just to put things in perspective i felt a lot older when i left movie hall than i entered it at almost 4 hours length it could have rather been made into a <UNK> serial br br what starts as a promising comedy slowly loses its pace <UNK> <UNK> has woven the plot around 6 love stories and he cant make justice to any one of them there is no <UNK> between them to start with and <UNK> shown in last 20 minutes just seem to be forced to connect the story br br situation is made worse by silly dialogues most of them repeated in hindi cinema over years and stupid cinematography br br <UNK> doesn't realise that she actually needs to play her role rather than just looking <UNK> on screen an utter waste of beauty without acting skills br br and then there is loud is humorous govinda my face twists better than jim carrey akshay <UNK> who keep <UNK> at the top of their <UNK> to <UNK> already tired viewers br br only good part in movie is john <UNK> love story nice acting comedy by <UNK> <UNK> but they are so good at their roles that just these two couples could have justified the movie without <UNK> it with other bunch of characters their brilliance gets lost in the midst of other <UNK> plot lines br br my guess director was making two separate movies may be more and some <UNK> assistant mixed up all the records beyond a point of <UNK> them out so director was left with no choice to show it all as a single movie br br watch it only if you want to test your patience
<START> thanks to warner archive i can once again see this <UNK> variety show which throws in everything but the kitchen sink the <UNK> however is present this film gives screen time to every person who was under contract to <UNK> at the time if some of the artists seem unfamiliar to some it is because they were big in the silent days and most faded with the popularity of the <UNK> there are some truly remarkable artists from the vaudeville era as well you will be most impressed with <UNK> <UNK> who performs two numbers also there is that french star irene <UNK> who <UNK> a love song in a sexy manner perhaps one of the biggest highlights is the two strip technicolor chinese fantasy which has been restored for this version it is truly beautiful and it stars myrna loy and nick lucas finally there is the massive lady luck finale which goes on for nearly a quarter of an hour this is truly an epic of the early <UNK> era any old movie buff will love this
<START> br br how this film ever got a 6 star average is beyond me the script is so banal and frankly an insult to <UNK> life it is based upon the cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising and the talented <UNK> scott should be ashamed <UNK> moore however shows none a surprise by <UNK> in this film if one looks at her <UNK> all in all a high concept style film that even don simpson would be ashamed of
<START> in black mask jet li plays a bio <UNK> super killer turned <UNK> who has to fight against other super killers bad plot bad <UNK> 60 million dollar budget but the fighting scenes were excellent jet li is the greatest martial arts star alive
<START> was this movie stupid <UNK> did this movie depth nope character development nope plot twists nope this was simply a movie about a highly <UNK> springer show it shows the <UNK> that some people will go to get their <UNK> on tv molly <UNK> did a great job as <UNK> <UNK> mom <UNK> is well gorgeous this flick wasn't so much made to be a breakthrough movie rather it was intended to life in a trailer park i live in a trailer park and <UNK> is nothing like the one in this movie where everyone sleeps with everyone else all the girls get pregnant by different guys and all the guys drive <UNK> out <UNK> ford <UNK> exaggeration of course but that's the picture everyone sees when you mention trailer park some people over analyze movies case in point star trek freaks i watch movies purely for the entertainment value not to point out that the girl is wearing a different shirt in a different scene read the goofs bit about <UNK> shirt could it have been better sure but it was funny as hell
<START> i have to say many people have <UNK> that some of us need to get with the times cause the new dukes movie is a <UNK> version oh please if this is what you consider <UNK> then hollywood can keep it many people on the <UNK> site have also said that and i quote you old <UNK> need to get over it and except it as is well let me tell you something i am 24 so i am a long way from being and old <UNK> and i won't get over it it was a disgrace to all that is hazzard county the only thing right in the movie title was hazzard was all the profanity smoking and drinking really necessary the cast was terrible jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly i believe it has all gone to her head she is in no way a daisy duke a <UNK> maybe but definitely no duke i love sean williams scott but not as bo they should have included the original cast as at least cameos but even hollywood knew they wouldn't <UNK> of the script i mean come on people even todays actors and actresses are <UNK> a negative opinion so why are some of you giving positive remarks
<START> so far nightmares and <UNK> has been <UNK> and disappointing the first segment directed by brian <UNK> may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares but at least it was well directed suspenseful and visually interesting with solid acting by william hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini series br br however the second story in the series was just dreadful and not in the good way the screenplay is bad <UNK> the shallow unlikable protagonists to act <UNK> in order to move the plot and having characters <UNK> on endlessly for the purposes of clunky unnecessary exposition the acting is overdone and unconvincing and i felt far more empathy for a cold blooded killer in the first story than for the <UNK> couple in the second the director used a million tricks to try to make the narrative spooky but with the amateurish acting and writing the end result looks like a <UNK> year film school project with camera moves for their own sake and little in the way of plot or tension br br if the rest of the series continues like this i'll be sorely let down i look forward to william h <UNK> installment and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment so far the quality is far too inconsistent to predict either way
<START> the dubbing translation in this movie is downright hilarious and provides the only entertainment in this otherwise dull and derivative zombie flick i haven't laughed so hard in my life as i just did watching zombi 3 and i've seen some really bad dubbing in my life believe me seriously the filmmakers could re edit this movie and release it as a comedy and make millions of dollars it's just that funny br br but if falling off your couch laughing at the dubbing in a fulci zombie movie isn't your cup of tea then avoid this at all costs
<START> what the <UNK> do we know was one of the worst times i have spent at the movies it was less of a movie and more of an after school special but at the same time nothing special at all the attempt at a narrative in which they grounded their ideas was absolutely pathetic which almost anyone will tell you <UNK> <UNK> in her underwear just shouldn't happen i won't <UNK> on it what i will reveal is a criticism that many are unable to <UNK> this movie while tedious also suffered a tremendous flaw in reasoning it was horribly <UNK> because it took such a manipulative become a creator of your life <UNK> of abundance <UNK> piece of propaganda <UNK> is explained as a large party of our existence however the movie encourages that we control our surroundings with our minds it completely <UNK> that there are other people with minds that could be controlling us which seems to be more the case or at least the <UNK> in which we exist greatly limit us in this way the movie was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> just don't mix unless you're god almighty if you are you will be impressed by all the neat things this movie will reveal that you can do if not you will be sorely disappointed a moron or perhaps both also the title is so ridiculous i have trouble warning people not to see the movie because i feel retarded mentioning it by name shame on everyone involved
<START> i saw this in the market place at the cannes film festival br br it's a real <UNK> <UNK> nothing wrong with that but you have to make up for it with a bit of sex or gore or both br br think larry cohen br br sean young is an interesting actor well done to the producers for <UNK> her i guess br br the opening scene in the space ship coming down is hilarious you could picture all the crew hands shaking it around br br ha ha but i wish the people who made this well at least it's not pretentious
<START> between <UNK> and 1939 <UNK> century fox made a ton of mr <UNK> films however towards the end of the series it was obvious that the studio had jumped the shark so to speak this phrase <UNK> that a tv show has passed its prime and the executives in charge decided to <UNK> the show by <UNK> changing the formula for example with the brady bunch they introduced the annoying <UNK> <UNK> and with family ties they introduced a freak baby who grew up six years in only one season with the <UNK> films they'd jumped the shark by introducing comic relief because they thought that these intelligent films needed to be re <UNK> in the previous film warren <UNK> played an annoying wrestler and in this film the character <UNK> <UNK> appears <UNK> might just be one of the most annoying examples of comic relief ever as you kept hoping someone preferably <UNK> would kill him just to shut him up although he's supposed to work for the famed scotland yard he shows all the intelligence and <UNK> of a brain damaged <UNK> again and again his scenes were <UNK> and unnecessary and peter lorre just looks <UNK> as he stands there and watches this <UNK> act it's so bad that it truly destroys what could have been one of the better <UNK> films due to its clever plot br br as for the plot the crown of the queen of <UNK> is discovered in the opening scene <UNK> now more of an international policeman than the amoral character he originally was is on hand to protect the precious item from being stolen in a great twist several thieves all try to steal the crown <UNK> of each other br br overall the film is watchable but is also ample evidence that the <UNK> series should have ended here with wwii approaching the films couldn't have survived much longer anyway as having a sympathetic japanese leading character simply wouldn't have been accepted in the us or in allied countries
<START> ok you want to test somebody on how comfortable they are with their <UNK> and the embarrassing and <UNK> changes <UNK> then get their immediate reaction from watching this <UNK> doc about kids making socially relevant horror flicks in the suburban 80's more than any movie i has ever seen the film deals with <UNK> sexuality and ego in a way that is completely human never dull and <UNK> in the kind of inherent goodness of youth that is <UNK> by the fear <UNK> adult world where any <UNK> in youth is <UNK> to anything from insanity to <UNK> mini <UNK> darren <UNK> seems to be reaching for a deeper understanding of his <UNK> and <UNK> as the <UNK> of strict kid's world what he finds in himself and others isn't always pretty but shows how one can improve and <UNK> with age what does change mean without reflection i love this movie
<START> the russian movie 4 follows the lives of three not four strangers who meet one night in a local bar one is a musician one a frozen meat <UNK> and one a call girl br br 4 i gather is intended to showcase the <UNK> and <UNK> of life in post soviet russia the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady <UNK> behind the scenes operating secret <UNK> <UNK> selling decades old frozen meat etc but the movie is so <UNK> and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what <UNK> really up to here br br despite decent acting and a few <UNK> directed scenes 4 is a two hour long <UNK> contest that should be avoided at all costs
<START> live feed is set in some <UNK> chinese japanese asian district somewhere as five american friends sarah ashley <UNK> emily <UNK> <UNK> linda caroline <UNK> mike lee <UNK> darren rob <UNK> are enjoying a night on the town taking in the sights after a <UNK> in a bar with a japanese <UNK> boss stephen chang they decide to check out a porno theatre as you would inside they are separated quickly find out that the place belongs to the <UNK> boss who uses it to torture kill people for reasons which aren't made clear can local boy miles <UNK> <UNK> save them br br this canadian production was co written produced directed by ryan nicholson who also gets a <UNK> effects designer credit as well one has to say that live feed is another pretty poor low budget shot on a camcorder type horror film that seems to exist only to cash in on the <UNK> success of hostel 2005 the mini <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> as it's become known according the <UNK> <UNK> section for live feed writer director nicholson wrote it after hearing about certain activities taking place in live sex theatres for my money i <UNK> he wrote it after watching hostel the script is pretty poor there is no basic reason given as to why this porno theatre has a big fat ugly freak dressed in bondage gear lurking around torturing killing people none was it for the <UNK> was it for his pleasure was it to make snuff films to sell some sort of explanation would have been nice also why did he turn on the <UNK> boss at the end if your looking for a film with a coherent story then forget about live feed it seemed to me to be some sort of uneasy <UNK> mix of sex s m horror torture gore action films which doesn't come off i mean just setting a horror film in a porn theatre isn't automatically going to make your film any good there still needs to be a decent script story right the character's were fairly poor clichés some of their actions motivations were more than a little bit questionable it moves along at a reasonable pace it's fairly sleazy mixing gore sex nudity but it does look cheap which <UNK> the effect br br director nicholson doesn't do anything special here the editing is choppy annoying he seems to think lighting almost every scene with <UNK> lights is a good idea the film has a cheap look about it available in both <UNK> <UNK> versions i saw the shorter cut <UNK> version which really isn't that gory but i am prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the <UNK> version say that it might be much much <UNK> but i can't say for sure there's a fair amount of nudity too if that's your thing i wouldn't say there's much of an atmosphere or many scares here because there isn't aren't respectively although it does have a sleazy tone in general which is something it has going for it i suppose br br technically live feed isn't terribly impressive the blood looks a little too <UNK> for my liking entire scenes <UNK> in annoying <UNK> lights sometimes makes it hard to tell whats happening it to often looks like it was shot on a hand held camcorder the choppy editing at least on the <UNK> rated version is at times an annoying mess shot on location in an actual porn theatre somewhere in <UNK> in canada the acting is poor sometimes i couldn't tell if the actresses in this were supposed to be crying or laughing br br live feed is not a film i would recommend anyone to rush out buy or rent i didn't think much of it with it's very weak predictable storyline lacking exposition which goes nowhere poor acting less than impressive gore at least in the <UNK> rated cut anyway watch either hostel films again or instead as they are superior
<START> you remember the spice girls movie and how bad it was besides the songs well their manager simon fuller also this <UNK> manager makes the same error putting s club another of my favourite bands in their own film s club tina <UNK> jon lee <UNK> <UNK> jo <UNK> hannah <UNK> and rachel stevens what happened to the seventh member paul <UNK> basically ask their boss for a break they go on and while there they see themselves on tv three of them <UNK> and vice versa half discover they are <UNK> made by a greedy scientist and the other half just get themselves in trouble also starring <UNK> gates as a clone of himself this film may have more of a plot than spice girls' film did but besides the songs bring it all back don't stop <UNK> and never had a dream come true this is no goo reason to see this film not too long after the band split for good adequate

<START> my college professor says that othello may be shakespeare's finest drama i don't know if i agree with him yet i bought this video version of the film first i love kenneth branagh as <UNK> he was perfectly complicated and worked very well in this adaptation surprisingly he didn't direct it but played a role lawrence fishburne shows that american actors can play shakespeare just as well as british actors can do not that there was a british vs american issue about it in fact if we all work together then shakespeare can reach the masses which it richly deserves to do apart from other shakespeare <UNK> this is dealt with the issue of race something that has existed since the beginning of time the relationship between <UNK> and <UNK> could have been better and shown the <UNK> of their union together while othello loves <UNK> with all his heart he is weak for jealousy and fears losing her to a non <UNK> man like <UNK> it's quite a great scene at the end of the film but i won't reveal the ending it's just worth watching i think they edited much of the lines to 2 hours but they always edit shakespeare
<START> my girlfriend picked this one as a southern born and raised african american i found this movie's plot and premise totally without credibility to believe that class and racial <UNK> would be so easily and <UNK> suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the <UNK> <UNK> south totally absurd i wonder how they got a good actor like harvey keitel and a good actress like <UNK> mcdowell who being southern knows better to participate in this crap
<START> as to the level of wit on which this comedy <UNK> barely even reaching feature length can i do it <UNK> i need glasses is a collection of mostly dirty jokes many of them are so short that you can't believe it when you realize that that was supposed to be the punchline example the santa claus gag others are so long that you can't believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up that punchline example the <UNK> awards gag and nearly all are directed without any artistry don't get me wrong about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny the iron phone one is probably my favorite there is also some wonderful full frontal nudity that proves yet again that the female body especially in its natural form is the best thing on this planet there is some comedic male nudity as well and i agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy but none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than out of 4
<START> yeah it's a chick flick and it moves kinda slow but it's actually pretty good and i consider myself a <UNK> man you gotta love judy davis no matter what she's in and the girl who plays her daughter gives a natural convincing performance br br the scenery of the small <UNK> summer spot is beautiful and plays well with the major theme of the movie the unknown at least unknown to me actors and actresses lend a realism to the movie that draws you in and keeps your attention overall i give it an 8 10 go see it
<START> this movie only got a 1 because you can't give a zero if you have a weak <UNK> at all don't watch animal rights people you don't want to watch either it makes people <UNK> i swear i witnessed it happen the only cool parts are the case and the fact that its a true story its really really super creepy that this guy worked at <UNK> while he killed people still feel safe when you punch in that little code i don't he had access to every code in kansas i hated the movie it was not scary it was mentally <UNK> do your self a favor and don t rent buy this movie i think it cost about 20 to make that includes their over paid actors
<START> the shop around the corner is one of the great films from director <UNK> lubitsch in addition to the talents of james stewart and margaret <UNK> it's filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as frank morgan and felix <UNK> they're the type of character actors that hollywood sadly no longer employs in fact the film itself is the kind of movie that hollywood doesn't make anymore the makers of you've got mail claim their film to be a remake but that's just nothing but a lot of <UNK> self praise anyway if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940's you'll find the shop around the corner to be nothing short of wonderful just as good with repeat viewings enjoy
<START> having endured this inaccurate movie i will admit that it is a more modern telling of the story than previous versions yet it is so inaccurate and has has been made so politically correct that it made me mad after watching it <UNK> <UNK> was very poorly represented by billy bob who i thought would have probably been better cast as sam <UNK> given both men's love of <UNK> i think self absorbed dennis quaid an actual <UNK> would have been a perfect <UNK> and it would have definitely fed into his <UNK> sense of self worship as a <UNK> and a true believer in the texas mindset i feel <UNK> <UNK> was the quintessential <UNK> even though not born here our <UNK> <UNK> is it ain't <UNK> if it is a fact was made for <UNK> and that last scene at the <UNK> where <UNK> is the last survivor has to be the biggest insult to <UNK> <UNK> ever made to even suggest that this giant of a man and seasoned fighter would allow himself to be taken alive is ridiculous three different eye witness accounts place him dead amid the bodies of a dozen or more dead mexican soldiers after undoubtedly fierce hand to hand combat finally that lame ending to the movie supposedly depicting the battle of san <UNK> as a mutual battle of <UNK> <UNK> vs 700 mexican soldiers when there was actually closer to 1 500 well trained mexican <UNK> every texas school kid who pays attention in their first texas history class knows the battle took the mexican army by surprise during <UNK> time and the mexican army was so confused they could not form ranks and <UNK> as they were not trained to fight frontier style hand to hand
<START> i'm a big fan of the old westerns and do not believe that hollywood is capable of capturing its old glory but not even <UNK> <UNK> and stewart granger can help this 1957 movie which carries nearly all the trite characteristics of westerns of the <UNK> <UNK> turned good guy fallen but <UNK> woman <UNK> <UNK> who must turn to <UNK> for salvation etc i can't help but notice the last names of the writer and young actor who plays <UNK> son any <UNK> there i've seen better acting in high school plays chill <UNK> plays a cartoon characterization of chill <UNK> have i reached the 1000 words yet
<START> it's funny it's not arthur miller or t s elliot but man this is funny kline and fields are great her toss off line god you are so disgusting as she climbs in his window great <UNK> running into the door after <UNK> out <UNK> <UNK> great too robert downey jr and kathy <UNK> work together <UNK> until he finds out who she really is a soap opera turn if there every was one br br the scene near the end in the chinese <UNK> area had my kids and i rolling on the floor that scene alone is worth the rental price br br doesn't solve any world problems or show the <UNK> <UNK> of daytime t v i hope just a lot of fun
<START> spoilers spoilers if one were to review the film based on the premise alone one might think that you were looking at an average animal <UNK> horror flick the plot is as follows a group of documentary filmmakers head off to an island in order to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or blood surfing i live in south africa so it was released as blood surf admittedly this seems to have a somewhat interesting idea behind it which if it were explored further could have improved the movie somewhat however this is not the case as the blood surfing part of the movie is minimal due to the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large salt water crocodile br br the script is absolutely terrible a good example of this is whenever someone gets eaten by the crocodile which is a frequent <UNK> in this film no one seems to give a damn the most anyone person did in the film was to merely <UNK> the victim in a scene which was meant to be poignant but just ended up being laughable due to the fact that the dialogue in this film was of a highly dubious nature another thing that really <UNK> about this film is the fact that they introduce characters who are totally superfluous to the film itself they introduce a bunch of pirates who can only be seen to be adding another 10 minutes to a mercifully short film br br the acting can be said to be mediocre it probably would have been a lot more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script to work from all in all there isn't one person who made a terrible impact on me every single person seemed to be a watered down caricature and in this way not one of these actors made any sort of impact on me br br the crocodile itself is said to be huge over <UNK> feet exactly and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious fake of a crocodile that they have provided for us in the film the <UNK> death at the end of the film is so ridiculously fake and contrived that it makes one's stomach turn with a huge cry of <UNK> the hero of the film <UNK> that he has a plan which turns out be falling down a hill and getting the crocodile to <UNK> himself on a luckily placed spike at the bottom of this said hill br br all in all i would say that this film is one which has to be seen for you to believe how bad it could be what probably seemed like a good idea at the time suffered from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of low <UNK> which all served to create a truly awful movie
<START> a grade z horror filmmaker carl <UNK> was one of the most prolific directors operating within the field of the low budget gory mayhem his movies are full of inept gore laughable acting boring sub plots and <UNK> dialogue a mysterious black clad figure is <UNK> murdering guests staying at the family mansion unfortunately this film is almost <UNK> you don't actually see the murders except with shadows and a few blood <UNK> the pace is <UNK> and the plot is rather uninteresting the acting is merely competent but the lack of gore and <UNK> left me disappointed a generous 4 out of 10 just beware do not mistake <UNK> film with andy <UNK> equally weak legacy of blood
<START> i don't know what i missed here but i can't believe all these positive comments by so many people on this film i thought it was silly and a bit over the top i did like the performances of <UNK> henry and michael <UNK> however the others were just boring br br now i like b movies i really do but this was a bit further down the <UNK> for me i saw someone compare the humor and horror in this to army of darkness and shaun of the dead as well as on par with the re animator you must be joking i didn't find this film funny it tried it did make an effort possibly too much of an effort but it failed in my opinion by the time i was hit with the 3rd or 4th one liner i was rolling my eyes and checking my watch br br there were definitely <UNK> made to several other films which is always cool kind of like an inside joke for us horror fans but here it may have just been a lack of original thought admittedly there were some nice special effects good gore but that can't carry an entire movie the mutated grant looked like a cross between <UNK> the <UNK> and in the early stages of <UNK> <UNK> from weird science after he was turned into the monster and one of the alien creature children from the <UNK> it just didn't work i thought it looked like something some kid from grade 5 art class could have designed then there was brenda the woman that grant <UNK> and <UNK> up in the <UNK> when help finally arrived she looked like a giant <UNK> waiting to be popped the design once again was totally unimaginative a round flesh colored balloon with a face in the middle yawn br br now about the zombies the more movies i see with zombies in them these days the more i wish george a romero had a <UNK> on them and was the only writer director allowed to make movies about them he's the only person so far to do it right with the exception of edgar wright and simon pegg but that was a comedy oh and danny boyle but they were a different style of zombie maybe mr romero has ruined any zombie film for me due to his ingenious ability to get his actors to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> about as if their <UNK> are <UNK> up and lacking even a drop of <UNK> fluid and their <UNK> are fighting the effects caused by <UNK> <UNK> that had started to set in right before they were re animated the people of <UNK> just didn't have the proper motivation they were horrible zombies br br so in the end i give <UNK> a 3 for a couple of laughs and a few nice gore scenes
<START> ok look at the title of this film br br the title says it all right the title is great i mean a lot of things should come into your head after <UNK> it in fact you might be extremely anxious to see it br br well sadly you won't see any of that br br just a bunch of bad actors some blood <UNK> some hot chicks and some <UNK> action br br oh well i think there are about 5 10 minutes of zombies and vampires indeed br br get away from this if you want to see a good movie else get it
<START> yeah the poster is quite a horrible piece of work br br i thought the movie was ok nothing really outstanding i just was hoping that he would be a hardcore <UNK> and totally trash his life br br <UNK> but that can't happen to rich kids now can it not to the son of a wealthy businessman who holds big ballroom parties and has a nice <UNK> lawn on the front of the mini mansion br br no the kid is too good to have his life totally <UNK> after all who will drive the brand new <UNK> and who will go to law school br br ah the poor little rich kids in their quaint pretty house with their <UNK> league schools ultra clean homes and <UNK> parties what will the world do without them br br i hope they all get addicted to drugs pass away their life and end up in jail so maybe we can see movies that don't all <UNK> around the poor little rich boys and girls of the surreal world
<START> walt disney's cinderella takes a story everybody's familiar with and <UNK> it with humor and suspense while <UNK> the <UNK> essential charm disney's artists provide the film with an appealing <UNK> look that <UNK> <UNK> fairy tale atmosphere it is beautifully if <UNK> animated the highlight being the captivating scene where the fairy <UNK> transforms a <UNK> into a <UNK> coach and <UNK> <UNK> to a gorgeous <UNK> mack david al hoffman and jerry <UNK> provide lovely songs like a dream is a wish your heart makes and <UNK> <UNK> boo that enhance both the scenario and the characters br br even though <UNK> story is predictable it provides such thrilling melodrama that one shares the concerns and <UNK> of the titular heroine and her animal friends both the wicked stepmother and her dreadful cat <UNK> present a <UNK> menace that threatens the dreams and aspirations of cinderella and the mice it is this menace that provides the story with a strong conflict that holds the <UNK> interest the film's suspense however is nicely balanced by a <UNK> <UNK> especially in the musical numbers it is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of cinderella and her friends moving the viewers to care for them overall walt disney's cinderella is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century
<START> <UNK> words are best experienced on paper the tales he weaves are <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of marilyn <UNK> or jerry bruckheimer explosions his words have been treated well once before in the remarkable <UNK> 5 br br mother night is probably one of the three novels <UNK> has written i could take to a desert island along with <UNK> 5 and <UNK> br br the film version deserves a 10 but the books are so <UNK> part of my interior landscape that i just can't do it some of the scenes left out of the film are part of my memory
<START> flavia <UNK> <UNK> of don't torture a <UNK> fame is locked away in a convent of <UNK> desires by her father tired of all of the <UNK> she sees around her rape of a young woman in a <UNK> sexual <UNK> horse <UNK> flavia decides to run from the convent with her jewish friend from the outside abraham the two don't get very far before they are captured and then brought back to be tortured and forced to <UNK> after punishment she joins up with a band of muslims called the <UNK> who had <UNK> the convent prior and leads a <UNK> that turns into nothing short of a bloody battle behind the convent walls flavia the <UNK> is a well directed and fairly notorious piece of italian <UNK> the film is slightly gruesome and sleazy at times the acting is great and the characters are well developed overall flavia the <UNK> is a genuinely moving and intelligent movie with plenty of nudity and gore you can't go wrong with it 8 out of 10
<START> is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be <UNK> scandal sex celebrity power kirsten dunst <UNK> her way through her role as silent movie star marion davies like she thinks she's in <UNK> blonde the guy who plays william randolph <UNK> overacts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him eddie izzard is pretty good except that he's playing charlie chaplin and is about oh <UNK> <UNK> too heavy for the part hard to believe this <UNK> uneven wreck was directed by peter bogdanovich but then again he hasn't made a watchable movie in what 30 years sometimes there's just no coming back
<START> <UNK> always present opportunities for dramatic films since in fact most <UNK> are in themselves dramatic events unfortunately what this film lacks in drama is <UNK> for by an <UNK> of boredom one cares not who wins loses dies or lives just end it as soon as possible this is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology scenes of paris and the french countryside have a cardboard quality about them they might better be done on a bare stage and left that way one cannot expect the amazing effects of the house of the flying <UNK> or the golden <UNK> but after all this is a 2002 <UNK> <UNK> production characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms in my view this film turns the french revolution of the <UNK> into the <UNK> <UNK> revolution of a <UNK> <UNK> world
<START> think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as power rangers and you have this film from 1990 robot <UNK> a movie where you fight with giant robots two men enter the <UNK> and whoever comes out their country wins the robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good it isn't all bad to watch there are as i recall two robot fights in this one one that ends badly and the final showdown there is a plot twist part way through as a <UNK> is revealed but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with you for any amount of time after the picture is done the fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage but still somewhat fun to watch this movie would also <UNK> a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the <UNK> so it is worth checking out once but probably not more than that
<START> i'm a fan of matthew <UNK> but this film which i stumbled upon on cable is absolutely witless i see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same so there was no one around to check her worst instincts there are no surprises no original lines and no original characters the <UNK> was basically the most sympathetic character what a waste of all this acting talent given how expensive it is to film in new york these days i have to wonder how this got made in the first place and if you're wondering why i watched it at all it came on after a film that i like on cable and i left it on while i worked at the computer it's not a very demanding picture
<START> i sat down to watch this film with much <UNK> and little hope i didn't think it would be possible for this film to live up to its subject matter but it absolutely did and then some first i must say that jared harris did an extraordinary job as john lennon at times it seemed that harris was <UNK> lennon the resemblance was often uncanny and he clearly studied <UNK> mannerisms and vocal <UNK> <UNK> quinn was quite good as <UNK> also bearing a striking resemblance to <UNK> although he did occasionally trip over his <UNK> accent br br this work of fiction was well written and well directed it was pure fantasy of course but sometimes i felt like a <UNK> <UNK> through a <UNK> at this reunion the <UNK> scene was especially moving as <UNK> told lennon what he had never heard as a child that he was worthy and important and it could never be his fault that he was abandoned by his parents i also enjoyed the scene in the park where the pair of them <UNK> with absolute abandon to the <UNK> band br br my one complaint would be this i am not so sure that john was as <UNK> as he was portrayed in the film at this stage in his life he had settled in to his domestic situation quite nicely and he was actually known to be quite friendly when approached by fans only a few years later he was very friendly when he was first approached by his assassin for an <UNK> on the day he was murdered br br mostly this film served to stir up those feelings again about what might have been had john lived a bit longer i am quite sure the beatles would have come back together at some stage and i am quite certain that lennon and <UNK> would still be friends today br br well done <UNK> i will watch it again and again br br
<START> she may have an oscar and a golden globe but this film shows why she also is a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to do a film that is so bad must be an indication that she needs money she could do ads on why you shouldn't talk on a cell phone while driving especially at night on the way to a crowded mall br br susan <UNK> should stick to producing shoot 'em up as she is not very good as a writer director br br she is <UNK> by four thugs in the mall parking lot and the first thing they do is tell her they have a gun what does she do she starts pushing and <UNK> them like she knows martial arts or something she manages to get away but gets lost in the forest after crashing why didn't she run to <UNK> house we get four thugs with guns chasing a lady with a <UNK> of course their guns are no match for her <UNK> ha of course she also has a tire iron and a <UNK> those poor thugs br br now she's home for christmas and she brought a gun
<START> i've had a thing for this <UNK> chick for a while and as far as how she looked in this movie no complaints but after catching it last night in high definition i am certain that's the only thing in the movie that isn't <UNK> the script is horrible the acting is horrible the direction is horrible i saw in another comment someone commenting on how great the sex scenes were what not at all when a movie is this bad you might as well just turn it into <UNK> porn but instead i get to see some <UNK> white dude <UNK> me from seeing <UNK> body and scenes that offer me nothing except a <UNK> they should have just gone <UNK> so that the movie wasn't a complete waste of time but no with a script this awful they should've <UNK> on <UNK> looks since that's the lone pro of the movie 2 10 only because she looked so hot
<START> i love this film it is well written and acted and has good cinematography the story <UNK> action humor <UNK> and <UNK> with great sets and beautiful location shots see it buy it show it to your friends br br the acting is good and murphy especially does a fine job portraying the reluctant unlikely hero i enjoyed all the characters and found them to be interesting and well developed with dynamic interactions br br i cared what happened to these people and while the outcome was pretty predictable the good guys win the hero gets the astonishingly attractive girl and the holy child saves lives who doesn't see that coming it still made me happy when everything worked out well in the end thank god this film's dignity was never ruined with a crappy sequel grab some popcorn <UNK> up on the couch and watch this fun happy and entertaining film
<START> they must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the hollywood bus station they then fill in the <UNK> and set their story in whatever <UNK> town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived you know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot four young boys playing in grainy slow motion accompanied by voice over narration next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion once they're grown it's easy to spot the writer director among the four he's the quiet <UNK> long haired one who is never seen without his composition book <UNK> in his pants this means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from <UNK> to hollywood only there's no writing or directing talent on display here and if you still can't figure out which one he is here's a hint the auteur and his character have the same middle name it took over an hour to figure out that these twenty something men were supposed to still be in high school what looked like a prison was apparently a high school the warden turned out to be the principal once more the poor misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the <UNK> murder and <UNK> but is <UNK> to stand up to his alcoholic father how about hitting back kid like you do everyone else numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose <UNK> bad dialogue many scenes badly out of focus cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience overacting in the extreme and if you don't quite get the self important speeches or the slow motion scenes just listen to the overbearing music it will clue you in and what you're supposed to feel poor marisa ryan must be <UNK> up lots of frequent <UNK> <UNK> as she travels around the country working in these amateur <UNK> films the biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies run over <UNK> <UNK> to a tree rob and steal all the while complaining about their sad sorry lives but if only we could get out of this <UNK> town and go to college yeah that's the ticket why is it that every twenty something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important so interesting that the world can't wait to see it <UNK> if this movie is as <UNK> as it seems then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive <UNK>
<START> if your a fan of airplane type movies this is a must see set in the <UNK> and 30's johnny dangerously has not only great actors but great lines knock down <UNK> wall knock down <UNK> wall and knock down <UNK> wall you shouldn't hang me on a hook johnny or sounds like <UNK> getting laid its definitely a spoof of the old james cagney movies and references them a lot there's a great scene when <UNK> walking down death row and has a priest set up for his escape listen closely to the fake priests <UNK> its pretty funny another great scene is when dom <UNK> plays the <UNK> watch his reaction to johnny after he <UNK> the <UNK> a lot said without making a sound i recommend this movie to all who love to laugh or are old movie buffs
<START> it was only when i saw <UNK> dynamite that i remembered seeing cracker bag just beautiful sentiment and yet never <UNK> to being <UNK> there is some terrific cinematography and the lead girl is quite brilliant it captures more than the nostalgia of the time it has a real heart to it it is the <UNK> wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful a simple story is always effective when done well this <UNK> <UNK> has a big future and i for one am looking out for his next project the follow up is always the most <UNK> thing it's like the second album blues for most people br br i just hope his next film is not something lame like a shark film cheers to all enjoy your cinema
<START> this movie is great if you enjoy watching b class movies that is this is a classic college 80's slasher movie in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack a horrible film but worth renting to make fun of or just to watch old men pop out of <UNK> with knives kinda funny if you ask me
<START> i have to tell you this is a great movie it surprises me sometimes how good a movie with no <UNK> can be this one is just fabulous it could be that it isn't trying too hard to send any kind of message it just tells a whimsical fun story i gave it a 10 out of 10
<START> considering john <UNK> apparently inspired kyle <UNK> creator i was expecting its pilot to be quite interesting however i probably had too high expectations because i was quite disappointed by it first they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience in a public area so after that scene i began to worry that it was just entertainment but the problem is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced they focused too much on john <UNK> which made the story far less intriguing i was also slightly disappointed by dominic <UNK> performance because i found he didn't make a believable john <UNK> an other problem was the police story it really felt like <UNK> <UNK> and it wasn't a pleasant sensation it leads us to the worst issue in the bunch the episodic format i could already see the <UNK> coming one after an other br br so overall i was very disappointed by it and don't recommend it to anyone considering how bad it was i better understand now why the show got canceled in some way i have the impression that it missed its target developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity it's sad because there was potential like the people he met at the club the production quality was also quite good and the casting correct but i'll never know if it got better probably not because i don't plan to watch the next episode
<START> i tried to watch this movie twice and both times i still couldn't make it to the end credits first time i managed to sit through the first fight sequence then lost interest second time i managed to force myself to <UNK> over an hours worth of shoddy acting lame <UNK> and extremely poor direction <UNK> in comparison to the original br br anyone ever hear about the old et <UNK> <UNK> fiasco for those who haven't let me fill you in it's 1982 et is one of the biggest box office <UNK> of all time <UNK> decides to release a movie tie in game on their <UNK> home <UNK> system to cut a long and <UNK> painful story short the game <UNK> big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of <UNK> <UNK> et games to be dumped in <UNK> because they couldn't even give them away let alone sell them br br what does universal soldier the return have to do with this story look at the 3 2 rating and figure it out for yourself br br awful film imdb forced me to give it a 1 out of 10 because their rating systems doesn't go as low as 0 let alone into the <UNK>
<START> this may just be the most nostalgic journey back in time through time to when one's childhood starts a journey to <UNK> back forth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> backwards up down all around the boy jimmy h r <UNK> dr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ludicrous lion even the evil <UNK> poo too through through the latter day <UNK> of <UNK> the brady kids saturday morning preview special <UNK> the sea monsters and land of the lost both the new old are what this very show <UNK> the gap to as well as the <UNK> marie show the brady bunch variety hour a k a brady bunch hour even the paul <UNK> halloween special maybe even other things in between beyond the buck just keeps on moving on on even beyond expectations as well as unexpected <UNK> now as we get updated in march of <UNK> we know that jack <UNK> gone so now it <UNK> it even more symbolic for us to really get nostalgic including now in august of <UNK> both when jack wild guest stars as himself on <UNK> and the sea monsters as well as when on a latter episode h r <UNK> does too and to recall all of the other nostalgic <UNK> of all the <UNK> marty <UNK> characters as well including the h r <UNK> <UNK> club the <UNK> and marie show the brady bunch variety hour a k a the brady bunch hour etc <UNK> stephen steve g <UNK> a k a <UNK> of <UNK> ma usa
<START> had fun watching this film despite the feeling i got a lot of the time that this film was almost <UNK> monsters inc <UNK> quite a few things that are extremely similar between the two the relationship between an animal monster and a small child other animals trying to break that relationship etc it felt like that pretty much throughout the film to me br br one of the redeeming features though is <UNK> very very funny character even if he serves no purpose
<START> the movie has a great written genre story it features all of the usual columbo ingredients the way lt columbo approaches and bonds to his suspect the way the mystery <UNK> for him <UNK> dog the cat and mouse play which is great in this one and luckily as well some good <UNK> humor mostly involving the columbo character it's all written despite the fact that it doesn't even have a truly original concept columbo hunting down a detective murder novel writer had been done more than once before in a columbo movie br br it's also an extremely well directed movie from james <UNK> who after this directed 5 more columbo movies in the <UNK> and <UNK> he provided the movie with style and some truly great and memorable sequences br br it's one of the slower moving columbo movies despite not having a too long running time this style and approach doesn't always work out well for a columbo movie but in this movie it does which is perhaps not in the least thanks to the acting performances of the movie br br most columbo movie either starred a big well known star or a star from the early days of film making as the movie its murderer this movie stars the rather unknown <UNK> year old ruth gordon she didn't starred in an awful lot of movies throughout her career but she is still well known to some mostly for her role in rosemary's baby which also won her an oscar she had a realistic and somewhat unusual style of acting which some people might not like though it earned her 4 more oscar nominations throughout her career prior to her win for rosemary's baby in 1969 she has some great interaction as well with peter falk in their sequences together br br the movie also stars a still young g d <UNK> i say young because i only know him from his latest productions out of his career despite the fact that he already was <UNK> at the time of this columbo production he is still alive but retired from acting ever since 1999 br br an even better than usual columbo movie entry br br 8 10
<START> sniper gives a true new meaning to war movies i remember movies about vietnam or wwii lots of firing everybody dies <UNK> <UNK> sniper takes war to a new level or <UNK> the movie certainly conveys all of the emotions it aims for the <UNK> of humans in the jungle the hatred and eventual trust between <UNK> and miller and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger a seemingly low budget film makes up for every flaw with action suspense and thrill because when it comes down to it it's just one shot one kill
<START> besides the fact that it was one of the few movies that i ever shed a tear over bye bye <UNK> this is one of the most beautifully crafted indian films that has ever been made from the finely crafted sets to those haunting looks <UNK> <UNK> gives no one can ever forget it the music of <UNK> is amazing all the more if you can understand the sublime poetry and is definitely one of those <UNK> 5 minutes another song movies you get the feeling of how trapped <UNK> is in among all the amazing <UNK> she wears and <UNK> court yard she casually walks past br br a parody of all the dreams you've ever had
<START> i tried to watch this movie three separate times the night i rented it got through about 20 minutes hoping it would be better if i had a <UNK> rest watched 15 more the next day almost <UNK> at how stupid it was it wasn't even funny stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just crap with a capital s if you know what i mean in the <UNK> world we live in and finally on the third day i watched over an hour of the dumb thing and i didn't enjoy one single moment not even one how did this script get <UNK> oh boy br br g br br 1 10 the one is for <UNK> they deserve at least something for all their <UNK>
<START> this rubbish excuse for television is the single most god awful piece of trash ever to hit australian television the house mates are dull uninteresting ridiculously <UNK> and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them as far as i am concerned big brother is the decline of western society showing how us as a society are on a <UNK> <UNK> to becoming brain dead morons whatever happened to television that didn't target the lowest common <UNK> of society as an audience this cannot be classified as entertainment i think that it true that channel ten can remove your soul it happened to <UNK> <UNK> who was once a respectable comedian and once moving to channel 10 become horribly unfunny with the exception of the simpsons which is highly intelligently made
<START> watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling over it while <UNK> channels br br i guess we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute christmas movie but were extremely disappointed br br the actor playing the soldier seems to have 0 emotion whatsoever his face looks the same whether he's <UNK> down christmas <UNK> seeing the girl he loves being <UNK> by her boyfriend or when he's happily surprised by the girl he loves he's an awful actor and at no <UNK> did any of us do nothing but laugh at him br br then there's the cute blond girl blessed with the ability to count <UNK> and cheat on her boyfriend what a catch and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more <UNK> br br so it's basically a story about a guy without any emotion or feelings who falls for a guy who count <UNK> and <UNK> on her boyfriend it's as predictable as it <UNK> and really a waste of time you gain nothing by watching this other than some weird laughs because it's all so corny br br i love it when her dad says that he only eats french <UNK> and not french wine and they all laugh that's the <UNK> attitude this movie is about furthermore if my girlfriends dad were <UNK> me around like i'd tell him a thing or to but not our army veteran no sir he let's everyone boss him around br br the movie is what first blood would have been if john rambo were burn like the biggest <UNK> in the world
<START> i really wanted to like this movie but it never gave me a chance it's basically meant to be spinal tap with a hip hop theme but it fails miserably it consistently feels like it was written and acted by high school kids for some school project and that's also the level the humor seems to be aimed at there is no subtlety and more <UNK> for a <UNK> it never once feels like a documentary and while the lines aren't funny in the first place an attempt at dead pan delivery would have helped certainly anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected to br br i'd recommend this to people who like comedies in the vein of big <UNK> house or <UNK> people who think that words like butt are <UNK> hysterically funny other people should stay away and not waste their time
<START> here's how you do it believe in god and <UNK> for your sins then things should turn around within the next day or so br br until the last fifteen minutes this movie just plays as a bad <UNK> of a <UNK> crappy life his mom dies his <UNK> a b <UNK> his dad dies he drinks he gets married he has kids he drinks some more his wife gets mad he disappoints his kids the wife threatens to leave he calls up a <UNK> late night b c he wants to kill himself then after the <UNK> happens that's when we get the left behind like subtle message br br he needed a paycheck this is the phrase i had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so i wouldn't lose my respect for madsen br br madsen drops to his knees and begs <UNK> forgiveness once he does he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way he tells his wife that he's found god and that's good enough for her flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church end the movie as madsen walks by the bar and gives a <UNK> about how happy he is with christ and without alcohol final moment he gives a little <UNK> wave to the bar i e sin house and give a gay miami vice after school special <UNK> jump in the air as the camera freeze frames see why i had to repeat the phrase he needed a paycheck br br man this movie is bad the b grade 80's production values don't help much the script could have easily been a touched by an angel episode it could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials the acting is wooden and never believable even madsen of whom i'm a big fan and is the sole reason i sat through this makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he doesn't know his a from his <UNK> yet on camera 45 minutes into it i started to get <UNK> this thing was like <UNK> i just wanted to put it away and say that alright i saw half of it that's good enough but no if i sat through <UNK> ninjas i could sit throughout this br br the only reason i'm not giving this thing a 1 is for two points 1 i love madsen i know it's not fair but it's great seeing the opening title introducing michael madsen sue me 2 some of the dialogue is so bad that it's classic i'll stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them too br br that's about it to wrap it up this thing is a piece of crap that should stay <UNK> with the rest of the <UNK> but hey look michael madsen see also <UNK> executive target my <UNK> daughter etc now i've gotta <UNK> <UNK> dogs and watch madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him see ya kids br br this <UNK> gonna make me go blind but i'm gonna drink it anyway <UNK> first taste of cheap alcohol br br i don't understand everything seems so beautiful madsen walking outside after <UNK> to god br br i'm going downtown later and pick up a bible and i'm gonna get a <UNK> too madsen after <UNK> at the dinner table because satan lives in your hair
<START> despite the high ratings given to this film by imdb users this is nothing more than your typical girl with a bad childhood <UNK> stalks married man film the attractive <UNK> <UNK> brief nude scenes may attract <UNK> but the film is hackneyed tripe br br 1 2 out of
<START> although twenty minutes of love is a harmless attempt at an early comedy it was difficult to follow and the film quality was not very good it does have a couple of moments that are funny but i have seen better by charlie chaplin
<START> there are very few performers today who can keep me captivated throughout an entire film just by their presence one of those few is judy davis who has built a successful career out of creating characters that are <UNK> in attitude but very vulnerable at heart she takes roles that most other performers would treat <UNK> and adds a fiery deeply emotional intensity that pulls attention away from everything else on the screen br br her skills are well displayed in high tide a film that matches her up a second time with director gillian armstrong who gave davis her first major success with my brilliant career in that film davis played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world despite the <UNK> she felt from her community and upbringing in high tide however <UNK> character <UNK> is roughly the opposite she gave up on any hope for her future when she was young and after giving birth to a child runs from her <UNK> and takes up a life without direction or meaning when she finally meets up with her daughter years later the thought of taking care of her child is <UNK> she knows this is her chance to <UNK> for her failures but how can she be honest with her daughter and still gain her respect br br gillian <UNK> films usually relate stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other but face obstacles set up by their own personal <UNK> and <UNK> oscar and <UNK> for instance was about a man and a woman who desperately needed each other's love but were always <UNK> by their <UNK> for chance represented by their gambling <UNK> here we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the mother's inability to commit to a settled life and her struggles to redeem herself despite being fully convinced that it's too late to change for the better this is not simply a film with a great performance at its center but also a rare achievement a fully convincing story of redemption
<START> i saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight i absolutely loved it the movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night cillian murphy is extremely creepy as the villain for those of you who have seen batman begins his character was much scarier in this film he played his character very well the scariest bad guy i have seen in awhile rachel mcadams was great everyone in the audience laughed <UNK> and <UNK> at the same time as if we were on cue the suspense is held through out the movie the amazing part is that the end was not anti climatic i was not disappointed in the end i felt satisfied the trailer does not do the movie justice the movie is much better than the trailer <UNK> do not wait for this movie to come out on video go see it although i did not have to pay to see this movie i would have gladly given 10 75 to see it enjoy
<START> since i'd seen the other three i figured i might as well catch this made for tv fourth part of the omen series as a stand alone film this movie is mediocre but as a sequel to the 1976 masterpiece it's a travesty the film goes along the same route that many <UNK> go down when they're running out of ideas that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female it's always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard the plot lacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a <UNK> minimum the film does keep a thread with the original which i won't reveal as despite being obvious that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie the <UNK> of the plot largely copy richard <UNK> original and see a young couple adopt a child which they name <UNK> not <UNK> or <UNK> fortunately there's a big dog involved and a child <UNK> and pretty soon the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal as she's <UNK> at eight years old and never suffered from any <UNK> br br the first two sequels to the omen weren't bad at all and the series really should have ended at number three i guess there was money involved somewhere down the line as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made it brings nothing to the table in terms of originality and the only thing it's likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series the film looks and feels like a tv movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl indeed asia <UNK> does look like a little bitch but she never convinces that she's the <UNK> as her stares are redundant and most of the <UNK> she does is laughable faye grant is given the <UNK> role and doesn't impress while the rest of the cast regret <UNK> to star in such an awful waste of time the only good thing about this movie is the theme tune which of course has been ripped off from the original and is <UNK> on the whole this film really isn't worth seeing as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for and doesn't even do justice to weaker second sequel
<START> i find it rather useless to comment on this movie for the <UNK> reason that it has nothing to comment upon it's similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world <UNK> for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it but since a comment is mandatory for such a <UNK> <UNK> br br filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other romanian movie directed by <UNK> <UNK> who insists to depict the so called romanian reality following the communist era 1990 to present days br br under no circumstances recommended for people outside romania as for the others who lately find amateurish camera lack of plot lack of directorial <UNK> quality etc noise etc as being trendy and even art like watch enjoy this movie as i know you will but do the other well <UNK> imdb members a favor don't write an online review for it will <UNK> <UNK> and in the end waste their time br br on the other hand this movie among others has some value whatsoever an educational one for it sets the example for how not to make a movie
<START> a real disappointment from the great visual master <UNK> scott g i jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the <UNK> training at the navy <UNK> the training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the <UNK> says in the film to the lead character <UNK> played by <UNK> moore there is no particular message or point in this film or then i couldn't reach it properly it may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the film br br i really can't understand why <UNK> uses so much <UNK> in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert it looks <UNK> stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so i would really like to know what the director saw in that technique when i look at his latest film black <UNK> dawn there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes which are plenty and they are very intense and directed with skill the whole finale in g i jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killing br br this is <UNK> scott's worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known still i'm glad i saw this in widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and <UNK> of scott's abilities but they are very few in this film br br a disappointment and nothing compared to the classics blade runner thelma louise alien and so on of this talented director so i'm forced to give g i jane 4 10
<START> i cried my heart out watching this movie i have never suffered from any eating disorder but i think this must be a very true picture br br alison <UNK> is excellent she expresses these feelings amazingly well my teenage years came back to me so vividly anyone who has gone through difficult times as a child or teenager will be able to relate to this movie i recommend you all to see it br br the music is great too i've now discovered diana <UNK> br br i'm also looking forward to seeing alison <UNK> in white <UNK> because i am positive she is perfectly suited for the role as <UNK>
<START> look although we don't like to admit it we've all have to <UNK> our fears concerning the extreme <UNK> of experiencing the events that take place in this movie you know you get into your car and you immediately start thinking gosh i hope today isn't the day that my <UNK> sticks at a comfortable <UNK> speed of <UNK> <UNK> all four door <UNK> break in the locked position both my main and <UNK> <UNK> fail my <UNK> switch can't be turned off and i've got a full tank of gas all simultaneously fortunately for most of us our <UNK> kicks in before we actually decide that it's a bad idea to be driving a car not so for the makers of the harrowing white <UNK> edge of your seat if only in <UNK> to leave the room action <UNK> runaway car but they go ahead and drive anyway br br i am endlessly pleased to have found thanks to the imdb that this movie is real and that i didn't merely dream it br br this movie is at the very least one of the fantastic sights you will see on your journey to find the el <UNK> of very bad cinema br br i highly recommend it
<START> this was a very enjoyable film a humorous but poignant look at family and the <UNK> that come with it the story of a man who comes home from his life in the city to his fathers bath house in a small chinese village there he learns to appreciate even <UNK> the very things he left home to get away from the film is as visually beautiful as it is emotionally beautiful
<START> i first saw this back in the early 90s on uk tv i did like it then but i missed the chance to tape it many years passed but the film always stuck with me and i lost hope of seeing it tv again the main thing that stuck with me was the end the hole castle part really touched me its easy to watch has a great story great music the list goes on and on its ok me saying how good it is but everyone will take there own best bits away with them once they have seen it yes the animation is top notch and beautiful to watch it does show its age in a very few parts but that has now become part of it beauty i am so glad it has came out on dvd as it is one of my top 10 films of all time buy it or rent it just see it best viewing is at night alone with drink and food in reach so you don't have to stop the film br br enjoy
<START> although this was not without its faults this drama was a fitting one to be shown around <UNK> time it reminded us of our spiritual <UNK> and showed that behind our <UNK> we often hide our deepest <UNK> and experiences there was so much to enjoy in the drama not least the <UNK> teenagers who provided a better musical <UNK> to the drama than the rather poor sound score in the background the acting was excellent and timothy <UNK> was once again superb the climax was very satisfying if rather simplistic timothy <UNK> letting go of his long dead wife's suicide was credible and <UNK> well the feelings of despair that were present in the teenage girl who self <UNK> the resolution between the <UNK> boy and the muslim was <UNK> but less believable a wonderful drama which left myself and my husband <UNK> that the evening had been well spent <UNK>
<START> also known as <UNK> to heaven in the us during wwii british peter <UNK> david niven plane is shot down in combat but he survives he meets and falls in love with lovely june kim hunter but it seems a mistake was made in heaven he should have died a french spirit comes to get him but he refuses he is soon to <UNK> his case in front of a heavenly <UNK> that he should be allowed to live br br sounds ridiculous but this is actually an incredible film the script is good with the actors playing the roles completely straight faced and it's beautifully directed the scenes on earth are in breath taking technicolor i've never seen such beautiful blue <UNK> and the scenes in heaven are in black and white niven is a little stiff at times but hunter is just great and very beautiful and roger <UNK> is superb as a doctor trying to help niven the imagery throughout is amazing especially the <UNK> and during the final trial sequence and the special effects are truly great considering the age of the film there's also a very strange sequence when niven runs into a totally nude young boy <UNK> sheep this is an absolutely beautiful thought provoking film highly recommended this remains unknown in the us which is a shame
<START> gena rowlands plays an actress who loses her grip on reality when she witnesses the death of a fan of hers she becomes increasingly <UNK> from reality and as a result her emotional turmoil <UNK> with her work as an actress in the sense that she breaks all the rules of acting and <UNK> everything yet still manages to engage her audience makes the film interesting if a bit self important as a parallel of <UNK> own struggles as a filmmaker there's so many ideas thrown around and as result it becomes a bit muddled i'm still <UNK> the relation between the dead fan and rowlands among many other things but the way they're presented in their <UNK> form makes it a consistently interesting and thought provoking film would be great on a double bill with <UNK> drive br br
<START> i liked this movie because it basically did more with less it could have been made more interesting if they had kept it confined to the studio even more though some of the plot elements would have been harder to develop br br the guy playing the dj did a good job of showing someone <UNK> out and haunted by his memories i also found his dialog with the <UNK> pretty funny br br while parts of the movie you can see coming a mile away other parts you do not expect to turn out the way they did br br i thought it was a pretty minimal ghost story for the most part <UNK> more on the living side of the <UNK> the last 5 10 minutes were pretty well done as everything is being revealed br br while it was a shorter movie it felt to be just about the right amount of time to tell the story any more and it would have started to drag
<START> what a surprise two outstanding performances by the lead actresses in this film this is the best work busy phillips has ever done and the best from erika christensen since traffic this film certainly should be in oscar <UNK> see this movie
<START> believe it or not the <UNK> massacre gave me full blown <UNK> that's right i've got a <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> from me just because a group of kids went playing around with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the devil and got distribution it's beyond my <UNK> how anyone with <UNK> intelligence could tolerate this <UNK> load of a film the only reason i managed to sit through the whole thing not without several suicide attempts along the way was because well first off i was delirious with boredom and second i guess i wanted to further explore this newly discovered type of hate i was experiencing this movie is a <UNK> on <UNK> horror comedy about three siblings who are left for the weekend in the care of their bitchy elderly aunt the youngest kid ends up stabbing the old lady accidentally with his rambo <UNK> hunting knife they then get to <UNK> <UNK> with various tools apparently she didn't have a single drop of blood in her body and <UNK> her into their <UNK> rented wood <UNK> her convict son then stops by looking for his mom and the kids end up <UNK> that jackass too i don't recall ever seeing a cast of annoying actors that actually caused me <UNK> seriously that one blond <UNK> voice had me <UNK> in pain constantly all of the actors were downright atrocious literally just screaming their phony sounding dialog and cracking jokes that must've been written by a <UNK> that just didn't care now i can usually appreciate independent efforts but only from those who can realize that people other than their relatives might be watching this i don't need to see a 3 minute shot of a car pulling out of a drive way and a <UNK> painfully long lawn <UNK> montage with some ridiculous <UNK> music playing over it plus why the hell does the box of this movie have a bloody piano on it there was a piano in one scene and no one is killed near it i'm through with <UNK> about this movie unless you like <UNK> crap i would advise anyone with half a brain to avoid this trash
<START> <UNK> edited together from dead body parts deleted scenes from corpses anchorman the frankenstein monster wake up ron <UNK> is definitely not a sight for sore eyes something you'd ever want to watch twice maybe even once for that matter br br more often than not the <UNK> of the scenes in <UNK> are made relevant by a third person narrator even more <UNK> is that the characters in <UNK> are inconsistent with the versions of themselves that we had at the end of anchorman in opening narration we're told <UNK> takes place shortly after the original at the end of anchorman <UNK> had grown since the start of the film and <UNK> having a hybrid co <UNK> lover in this film he's back to his immature antics with prank phone calls to <UNK> quite clearly these are the more of the same scenes from the original anchorman spliced in to <UNK> br br the part that makes this a movie a continually <UNK> story involves a bank robbing clan without a cause called the alarm clock these scenes are almost painful to sit through this part was <UNK> from the original scripts for anchorman br br the majority of other scenes involving our channel 4 news team are clearly alternate deleted takes on scenes from anchorman they go to the same party as in the original the same original group <UNK> about having a woman on the team scene and the same cat fashion show segment that <UNK> had <UNK> to <UNK> br br <UNK> re creates their first date with the drive in spot <UNK> san diego and dinner at his favorite club <UNK> neither character make mention that they've been to the drive in spot before and when <UNK> walks into <UNK> with <UNK> he introduces it to her as though they've never been before oh and they're wearing the same clothes as on their original date br br still i have to give some credit to the filmmakers even if <UNK> is nothing more than a clever way of presenting deleted scenes tied together with narration between the two ron <UNK> stories this is the weaker one looking back on it it's quite a feat for anchorman to have <UNK> from the <UNK> of <UNK> you stay classy imdb thanks for stopping by
<START> as other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1 2 hour however before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by kate <UNK> who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she's in connery is fine as is <UNK> but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which <UNK> the entirety with a sense of <UNK> and the ending is simply bizarre the film makers apparently knew when they <UNK> this mess together that all they needed were sweet <UNK> and <UNK> pie to have <UNK> dinner so to compensate they added an <UNK> dramatic score every little jump is accompanied by a <UNK> of <UNK> to the point where it becomes laughable if you want an example of major league bad film this is one to see otherwise skip it
<START> at first three words read the book really guys this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of <UNK> matters i loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film it was ludicrous with half a heart and the story bad explained the novel in the first place wasn't meant to focus on an adventure that's only the surroundings in the film the focus <UNK> to just that and the message has taken a back seat additional the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the <UNK> of the events at the end were <UNK> they screwed it up i'll never watch it again
<START> i went into this movie hoping for the best i like wartime musicals in general dick powell and lucille ball did good jobs with their roles however the writers gave them boring dialog the love interest between the two of them was not given any real growth just suddenly it was there i did not think much of the music the best number was the <UNK> we heard of spike jones with der <UNK> face the one complete number that spike jones did had little of his great musical comedy pretty tame stuff even with the monkey bert <UNK> comedy skits were interminable br br there were parts to enjoy lucille ball was quite a <UNK> and there was a good selection of bit players who really deserved more time on screen
<START> i watched this movie after seeing other comments on imdb even convincing my wife that it was a unique horror movie i wanted to like this movie but was unable to br br the love story was good but the horror aspect was quite bad if the story was just about a young man who fell in love with a girl suffering from <UNK> then it would have been a better movie br br the care centre stretched <UNK> well past the limits in fact it was quite ridiculous the doctor happily <UNK> <UNK> laws and <UNK> a nurse goes into a room for a routine feeding of a dangerous patient without security <UNK> and drops the <UNK> and runs out of the room screaming for no apparent reason the <UNK> patient and the film's villain is tied up in a standing position fully <UNK> apparently for years none of it makes much sense br br the movie even had some actors that i've liked in other things such as the detectives but still i can't recommend this movie
<START> don't mind the soundtrack which is played out by now br br still debra <UNK> is always interesting and while this was an earlier role for her she is quite good as <UNK> girl from the wrong side of the tracks lived in trailer with bud travolta only to be replaced for a time by city <UNK> <UNK> smith as a rival br br i agree with an earlier review regarding scott glenn he is used for plot only thrown in to the mix to create suspense the story is predictable and contrived br br also even though i am from the east many of us did not like saturday night fever while it had its moments the <UNK> stereotypes are beyond criticism at this point br br worth seeing for debra <UNK> she is still so likable and never had that hollywood persona we are subjected to by too many actresses today 7 10
<START> sam <UNK> should never be allowed to touch a camera again if he does he should be arrested on the spot at the very least for petty <UNK> anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be <UNK> this was <UNK> my first viewing of his work and it will my last ed wood looks awfully good to me right now br br when i return this piece of crap to the video store i will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf an active <UNK> of gay cinema i am <UNK> and <UNK> that this <UNK> exceedingly <UNK> man child be allowed to <UNK> and package something like this with a <UNK> pretty boy on the cover jamie brett <UNK> who thankfully has no other acting credits in imdb and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait and then market it as a movie rental trust me this has no place being on any rack anywhere it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word offensive irresponsible junk such as this can only be <UNK> to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema hell gay rights in general for those <UNK> to rent this out because of the cover you will be disappointed <UNK> is not as <UNK> to look at on film as he is on the cover and he appears once or twice without a shirt that's it instead the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on us his own disgusting sorry looking <UNK> boy <UNK> br br this thing he assembled is a reverse vanity project for <UNK> both he and his friend michael <UNK> who i understand puts out similar sleazy garbage are terrible in this <UNK> is <UNK> posing as a complete no talent in all fields desperate to grab onto any loser attention he can for himself he is to be <UNK>
<START> when i was very young on a local tv station they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on <UNK> i saw lots of kung fu movies on <UNK> i remember lots of them i saw great flicks like crippled masters blind fist of bruce kung fu zombie shaolin drunken monk rage of the master <UNK> dragon and five deadly <UNK> i remember the day clearly me and my dad had just gotten lunch at <UNK> king we were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday we ran in the house and jumped onto the couch turned on the set and <UNK> it onto <UNK> the usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words kung fu saturday over it then under that was the title of the film it said five deadly <UNK> then the movie began i bit into my <UNK> amused with the pre credit sequence i loved this movie the minute it came on my favorite character was the <UNK> <UNK> the plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn't what <UNK> me it was the fighting the fights were so amazing i <UNK> every time a commercial came on and soon the 2 hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended
<START> if you like star wars trek come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices it's my top 2 favorite movies of all times other <UNK> futuristic and psycho thriller the intensity of the root material shakespeare's the <UNK> is not overshadowed by <UNK> <UNK> a la later lucas and just because it was made in 1956 don't assume you can <UNK> the <UNK> holding the flying <UNK> up this was the first movie where you couldn't miracle it was made at a movie scale <UNK> and tastes at the time were <UNK> heavily against it and director <UNK> previous <UNK> was <UNK> come home until i looked him up i assumed <UNK> <UNK> was a <UNK> for a director who was already or later became famous but at the time didn't want to be associated with sci fi which was strictly a b genre back then this was either a very very <UNK> production or a very <UNK> <UNK> on the part of the folks who <UNK> hollywood br br there are the massive scale <UNK> with live action almost <UNK> inserted that lucas used <UNK> there are intelligent machines that <UNK> the stereotypical <UNK> <UNK> computers as they've come to be portrayed much less <UNK> in later works star <UNK> <UNK> is there visually almost <UNK> by <UNK> 10 years later and if the trek wars <UNK> turns you off <UNK> scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate even today the ship set is <UNK> <UNK> realistic as good as anything you've seen since and more convincing than anything <UNK> has done for tv or film we didn't get to spend as much time there as i would have liked br br if you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently watching <UNK> will explain all that it's definitely not <UNK> to the <UNK>
<START> there's something frustrating about watching a movie like <UNK> by <UNK> because somewhere inside that hollywood formula is a good movie trying to pop out however by the time the credits roll there's no saving it the whole thing is pretty much blown by the cop side of the story where sandra <UNK> and ben <UNK> homicide detective characters <UNK> through an awkward sexual affair that becomes more and more <UNK> the longer the movie goes on although <UNK> is strong in her role it's not enough to save the lackluster script and lazy pacing ben <UNK> talents are wasted in a forgettable role he did much better earlier in the year in the underrated <UNK> <UNK> as well as chris penn who has a role so <UNK> small you feel sorry for a talent like him anyway the plot really isn't even a factor in this movie at all the two teen killers played by ryan <UNK> and michael pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie their talent and chemistry work pretty good and they play off of each other quite well it's too bad they weren't in a much better all around film <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> way too safe ground here for such a seasoned filmmaker bottom line it's worth a rent if you're a genre fan but everyone else will live a <UNK> life without ever seeing it except maybe on network tv with convenient commercial breaks
<START> warning no plot spoilers ahead but movie spoilers nonetheless my significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all star cast wow very very wrong this movie is an overdone overwrought and overly sentimental excuse to <UNK> release a student film 15 years after it was shot the <UNK> date on the box said 2005 yet during the very first flashback sequence i was looking at the clothes and <UNK> that were supposed to be the early 1960s and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s early 90s dresses and <UNK> it looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film i tried to <UNK> myself that it was a flashback and therefore supposed to look old but it looked <UNK> more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s then an adult <UNK> of the lead character turns up and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences yet it's a different much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks i was completely confused until i saw in the special features the short film included it was all the flashback sequences shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie it also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up and indeed acting the co worker in the 2005 scenes thus this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old re cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time the shell story shot in 2005 is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his <UNK> something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60's to his girl that they would meet on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005 these new scenes and plot might have been ok except the awful overly sentimental score that repeats ad <UNK> over almost every single new scene and the clichéd action that <UNK> the new movie don't bother there's a reason why you've never heard of this movie even though it has a well known cast it's terrible
<START> when you typically watch a short film your always afraid that the person creating the film tries to throw too much into it that's not the case with this one a great story about a young girl who's had enough and other <UNK> forces trying to help make things right br br eric <UNK> does a wonderful job of representing the spirit of twisted justice and helps to convey the <UNK> of the <UNK> line of right and wrong br br both the young girl and the father give great performances in this wonderful short film but <UNK> performance is definitely the show <UNK> in this story br br i definitely recommend this film for it's complexity performance and great over all story
<START> sorry everyone i know this is supposed to be an art film but wow they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch although the scene design and <UNK> direction was excellent this story is too painful to watch the absence of a sound track was brutal the <UNK> shots were too long how long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking especially when the dialogue is two people complaining i really had a hard time just getting through this film the performances were excellent but how much of that dark <UNK> uninspired stuff can you take the only thing i liked was maureen <UNK> and her red dress and dancing scene otherwise this was a ripoff of bergman and i'm no fan f his either i think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1 2 hours of this is well lying
<START> so what's the big fuss out of making an indiana jones wannabe when you have an actor who's cast as a fictional dude from adventure <UNK> who doesn't want to go out on an adventure whoever wrote the script for jake speed was probably fired but for whatever reasons possible this movie greatly lacks in excitement that doesn't mean it has no action but look on the dark side of the picture this has got to bare no resemblance to indiana jones or other action adventure thrills containing <UNK> and narrow escapes and jake speed was promoted that way using clever propaganda to make me and several others interested in it besides i've never heard of the guy so who needs his attention
<START> i really enjoyed this film all aspects of the film were top notch including the most important for me anyway the screenplay and the acting this is definitely one of richard <UNK> strongest roles he is totally convincing in his performance just out of curiosity imagine how <UNK> bogart or robert mitchum might have <UNK> this role this is my first exposure to jean <UNK> work that i can remember she impressed so much here that i will definitely be on the <UNK> for her other work thelma ritter in an <UNK> role deserved the oscar nomination she received for playing the <UNK> this film works on every level the black and white photography is perfectly appropriate and the story <UNK> the viewer right from the beginning widmark and peters have great chemistry in their difficult romance strongly recommended 9 10
<START> i thought it was a new york located movie wrong it's a little british countryside setting br br i thought it was a comedy wrong it's a drama well up to the last third because after the story becomes totally <UNK> the symbolic word for a french presidential <UNK> it means close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling br br what do i have left maybe a good duo of actress yes i know they are 3 friends but the <UNK> <UNK> is a bit invisible for me the tall <UNK> surprises by her punch and mcdowell delivers a fine acting as usual all in delicate soft and almost mute attitude this <UNK> <UNK> me because as other fine artists or directors the same pattern is repeating over and over in her case it's like whatever the movie it's always the same character defined by her feelings her values who lives <UNK> different stories i still don't know how to set the limit or the <UNK> between the artists and the works br br another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch the interesting different points of view the women have each their own way of living even if they are all single it brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people br br finally the movie is quite <UNK> but the great final cuts the desire of a next vision
<START> i saw this film at the london premiere and i have to say i didn't expect much but i did expect something that was at least mildly entertaining br br the original basic instinct was no great film and is still something of a <UNK> classic but it was entertaining i can recall countless times flipping through channels on tv on a late friday or saturday night having come across the movie and finding myself beginning to actually pay attention to it br br however this lame brain <UNK> <UNK> sequel has nothing is sharon stone still gorgeous well let's put it this way for a <UNK> year old she's pretty hot is she as beautiful as she was in the original no she also has clearly had plastic surgery on her face and her <UNK> in this movie is somewhat unappealing she doesn't look as soft or genuine or innocent as she did in the original which is sort of the whole point of being an evil <UNK> and <UNK> br br the rest of the performances range from bad to terrible and michael <UNK> jones a typically safe director one who doesn't always do great work but manages to make worthwhile movies has officially delivered his first true turkey a movie so bad people were laughing at certain moments that were intended to be serious br br i hear the film went through multiple editing sessions and it's very clear from the start nothing makes much sense the whole plot is a <UNK> mess and the ending oh my talk about stupid and unbelievable still predictable though i saw <UNK> i saw son of the mask and although i'm not looking to <UNK> this film i can say with my own authority which you don't have to agree with at all mind you that i prefer both those films over this <UNK> failure br br by the way stone left five minutes before the movie began and people in the theater began throwing things at the screen during a particularly outrageous and insulting scene inside an orgy type nightclub br br basic instinct 2 basically it stinks too
<START> pecker proves that waters has no intention of changing his tacky ways in his old age a lot of things have changed since waters started making films in the 1960s but 40 years later he is still doing what he wants to do over the years the budget of <UNK> films has <UNK> considerably this is one of his most recent productions but i was amazed to see that waters still has that trailer park touch edward <UNK> plays pecker a kid who is obsessed with photography he lives a quite life in <UNK> <UNK> with his friends and family but pecker <UNK> the attention of a new york art agent the always watchable <UNK> taylor and his life changes for the worst once again waters makes fun of art fame and <UNK> it is not among his best films but there are some big belly laughs here <UNK> has the best lines in the film it is consistently clever and funny and has that very <UNK> sensibility that i have come to love in <UNK> movies
<START> surprisingly well made little movie short in length at about 90 minutes for a low budget movie very well made plot is slow to unravel cast is excellent especially elizabeth van <UNK> as the girlfriend with <UNK> syndrome
<START> this is a weird movie about an <UNK> studying the culture of the ancient <UNK> indians she takes a really fake looking mummy out of a burial cave and brings it home to study it well pretty soon she starts acting weird and talking to this mummy and shortly thereafter her son becomes possessed by the spirit of the mummy even stranger events take place as the spirit then tries to destroy the woman's family this is actually really boring overall and it will make you fall asleep the first couple of times you try to watch it but if you keep at it you may just make it to the end br br <UNK> what is the secret of the mummy is the <UNK> spirit angry that it has been removed from the cave you may not be able to <UNK> what the <UNK> motivation is but if you like spooky <UNK> on a low budget and 70's <UNK> this will have a certain <UNK> appeal br br the way i have described the story is much <UNK> than the <UNK> boring way the film lays the story out can a boring movie really be fascinating well somehow this one achieves that maybe this is a good movie at heart but executed in a rather awkward way i don't know what i do know is that i enjoyed it quite a bit despite its <UNK> br br fans of spider baby will be interested to know that a couple of music <UNK> from that film are used in this one including an <UNK> version of the theme song br br featuring one frightening and fairly well done sequence showing possessed <UNK> and rocks rolling around by themselves and eventually attacking some people in a <UNK> other scenes in the movie are merely spooky or quirky but this one scene is actually pretty scary br br see this it's weird and it's worth your time you might even want one on your shelf
<START> in 1954 marlon brando was the hot actor after his performances in <UNK> named desire and on the <UNK> frank sinatra had yet to re <UNK> himself on the silver screen but sinatra's portrayal as the <UNK> nathan detroit helped re establish sinatra with his fans br br it is a great screen version of a great play and the choices of leads and support players are terrific imagine a movie where brando sings this was his one and only singing role as he portrayed sky masterson in addition the female leads jean simmons and vivian <UNK> <UNK> her stage role as <UNK> long suffering girlfriend <UNK> put in <UNK> efforts special mention goes to the great <UNK> <UNK> as nicely nicely and with all due respect to eric <UNK> no one's version of <UNK> the boat even comes close to <UNK> <UNK> leonard who would go on to fame as tv producer of such shows as the danny thomas show and the dick van dyke show does harry the horse wonders b s <UNK> is excellent as the harsh mannered and rough talking big julie and even <UNK> <UNK> offers his excellence as brother <UNK> br br it is one of the fun musicals to see good comedy and you get sinatra and brando <UNK> luck be a lady tonight and brother it's your <UNK>
<START> what kind of a documentary about a musician fails to include a single track by the artist himself unlike ray or countless other films about music artists half the fun in the theater or on the couch is <UNK> the great songs themselves here all the tracks are covers put on by uninteresting characters and these <UNK> fail to capture <UNK> slow <UNK> style more often the covers are badly sung folk versions <UNK> br br the interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures rather than with cohen himself only rarely does the film feature cohen reading his own work never singing like letters <UNK> etc the movie really didn't capture much about the <UNK> life story either or about his development through the years a huge disappointment for a big cohen fan
<START> it is unbelievable that a script as cliché and completely absurd could make any screen even the small one the dialogue in this movie makes <UNK> seem like a high culture classic billy zane plays the bad ass <UNK> playing elvis <UNK> <UNK> martial arts master who <UNK> on the life of a down an out former football player turned gambling addict played by the winner of <UNK> <UNK> show next action star his performance is as cold as ice and not in a cool way the film takes place in vegas and since people play poker there the writers felt it was a perfect setting for a movie about a guy trying to survive 24 hours against an <UNK> wealthy <UNK> who has offered his target 2 4 million if he can make it through the day and so the hunt ensues a hunt <UNK> with unimpressive explosions construction yard settings shoddy cinematography and one liners containing the word bet or <UNK> the female winner is also tossed in the mix but for what reason i have no idea oh but don't worry <UNK> fans the losers make their memorable cameos as well the surprise ending will knock your <UNK> off if you love predictability or <UNK> joel silver should <UNK> his decision to sell out even more i wish he could give me those two hours of my life back
<START> the question when one sees a movie this bad is not necessarily how did a movie this bad get made or even why did i see this awful in the first place but what have i learned from this experience here's what i learned br br just because the rules of horror movies have been <UNK> and <UNK> countless times in the last ten years doesn't mean someone won't go ahead and make a movie that uses all of them without a shred of humor or irony br br if your movie has to be described as loosely based on the video game you have script problems br br the black character may not always die first but the asian character does always know kung fu br br while you may be proud that you figured out how to do the the matrix effect on a budget that doesn't necessarily mean you should use it over and over again ad <UNK> br br being ron <UNK> brother does not guarantee choice roles br br whenever a scene doesn't edit together just use some footage from the video game no one will notice br br if your <UNK> rap metal band offers to write your movie's theme for free <UNK> decline br br zombie movies are not about people killing zombies they're about zombies killing people preferably in the most gruesome way possible that's what makes them scary br br white people who can pay <UNK> to get to a rave deserve to die br br if you find an old book it will tell you everything you need to know anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks what was that or where are we br br bare breasts are not horror movie <UNK> br br a helicopter boom shot and a <UNK> deal with <UNK> magically transforms your movie from student film to major studio release try it br br just because you can name drop all three living dead movies that does not make you george romero or even paul w s anderson br br i've seen worse movies but only because i've seen mortal <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i watched this film version of r d <UNK> classic novel as a substitute until the 2001 a e version was released on video and what a poor <UNK> it proved to be br br this version does not have the authentic i feel like i'm there aspect of the a e movie the actors are for the most part wooden with sean bean the exception and the romance seems forced and contrived in fact there is no kissing until the end of the movie the triangle between john <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or lady <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you prefer and the evil <UNK> <UNK> isn't mentioned or expanded upon we don't get much insight into <UNK> here or as to why he has some if any romantic feelings for <UNK> this movie cuts out many of the key and interesting characters of the novel such as <UNK> <UNK> and john's sharp <UNK> youngest sister <UNK> which were crucial to the plot the screenplay itself is lacking in conviction the political intrigue also doesn't figure in the script the way <UNK> came into being with the <UNK> isn't true to the original story now don't get me wrong clive owen is a handsome and talented actor watch <UNK> park and king arthur for <UNK> but he comes across as bland and stoic throughout and long hair it may have been a bad wig just doesn't suit him polly walker is a lovely and accomplished actress see enchanted april and <UNK> games in which she also <UNK> with sean bean but she appears <UNK> and lackluster she has a cold sore on her lip that make up can't hide and the costumes don't seem authentic the late robert <UNK> does a respectable turn as sir <UNK> <UNK> although he only refers to <UNK> as his favorite rather than his <UNK> which she was <UNK> to be in the book also it seems to me that owen and walker are too old for their roles maybe it's the make up and the scenery is brown cold gray and <UNK> without so much of a hint of a sunny sky i understand that it is set in <UNK> england but it is green there and they do get their sunshine the portrayal of tom <UNK> character and his death which doesn't happen in the novel <UNK> the film even more the one positive note is sean <UNK> performance as <UNK> although it doesn't even come close to matching <UNK> <UNK> portrayal in the a e movie bean does make one mean villain in short watch this only if you've got a few hours to kill but don't expect anything exciting or for it to be true to the novel see any other version but i highly recommend a <UNK> film over this tired adaptation
<START> i don't think anyone sitting down to view this film would be expecting anything remotely appearing like a classic ghost story but you have to ask yourself when it's over if you were ever scared this doesn't really work on that level but the cast does try hard and the film doesn't <UNK> on one of those happy endings story is about an american couple who travel to <UNK> japan so that ted <UNK> edward albert can write a book and he brings along his wife laura susan george and their daughter amy amy <UNK> their friend alex curtis doug <UNK> who works at the american <UNK> helps them find a house to live in and he finds one that is haunted about <UNK> years earlier in the same house a samurai found his wife cheating on him and he kills both of them and then commits suicide their ghosts still inhabit the house and when the <UNK> arrive it doesn't take long before strange things start happening br br spoiler alert br br at times the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the <UNK> and they start to act like the japanese people that they were before and laura starts to <UNK> with alex which leads to an affair meanwhile ted starts behaving more strict and after he <UNK> soup down the throat of amy he goes to ask a monk for help unfortunately the ghosts get ted laura and alex to play out their death scene like it happened <UNK> years earlier br br this film was directed by kevin connor who is known as a good television director but he has made horror and science fiction films before and has worked with <UNK> on some of them while this never comes close to being scary or developing atmosphere it does have two things in it that i liked first it doesn't have one of those sappy endings where the couple embrace after <UNK> the demons instead it ends in a very bloody fight where everyone <UNK> to the evil of the ghosts secondly it has susan george in the cast i've always been a fan of hers even though she has appeared in mostly schlock but her performances are always top notch also she usually appears nude which she does here in two separate scenes and while she doesn't have classic features she does have a unique <UNK> like look about her and it's one of the reasons why she was so popular but after appearing in silly films such as this i think it led to her getting out of the business or working only <UNK> this isn't a bad film but it's never convincing and watching the ghosts <UNK> around when the monk gives an <UNK> is practically worthy of a giggle or two the bottom line is that this is silly and i hope george decides to resume her career
<START> i think this is almost all i need to say i feel <UNK> to explain my actions though i've basically never seen such an <UNK> production and i mean that in all senses of the word although the physical camera work boom <UNK> operation and other technical aspects of this film are laughable unfortunately its not the only areas br br unlike some classic independent films that have been saved by their scripts great characterization and plot this unfortunately has an awful script awful acting and worst of all awful annoying characters br br it's a crime that for the every independent film that gets distribution like <UNK> tunnel there's a 101 other indie films that died silent deaths i don't know who the kornbluth brothers know at <UNK> but that can be my only explanation as to how this amateur family production ever got distribution i'm quite <UNK> as to why they picked this up br br the only part of this film that holds out any intrigue is its title however the reason for that is even a let down i hope this review will save a few people that may be intrigued by this films title from going to watch it i've seen a lot of films in my time and i'm very <UNK> when in the cinema but this was too much i'll never forget <UNK> for <UNK> an important point in my life experience of cinema shame it's such a low point br br
<START> if the australian post office ever needed a <UNK> film for <UNK> then this is it this is one of those movies who's heart is in the right place and you can watch again and again <UNK> performance is touching as it shows an aspect of australia <UNK> by many europeans in that it can be cold wet and bleak just like anywhere else and just like anywhere else what is important is the people that <UNK> you the characters in the movie are warm and <UNK> and make the <UNK> of a career move into a <UNK> letter <UNK> a thought to be considered miranda has gone on to do bigger movies but i hope she always keeps a thought inside for this one
<START> three horror stories based on members of a <UNK> <UNK> cult that return home but changed in some way in the first story our former cult member is now in an insane asylum and is visited by a reported who wants to find out about what went on at the cult somewhat slow going as story is told in flashbacks while the two sit on <UNK> and face each other reporter is particularly interested in what lead to the death of the participants what seemed rather boring suddenly turns very exciting with a surprising twist in the story things get quite bloody br br second story has a violent young criminal visiting a psychiatrist for mandatory therapy the patient seems to have some type of agenda but the psychiatrist is up to the task again things slow down a bit and get weird then there's a strange twist in the story that is very well written and surprising br br final story deals with spiritual <UNK> who claims to be able to remove the persons illness from them with his hands one of the patients is a former cult member so the successful healing gets more complicated again we are surprised by a twist has a pretty gory scene in there br br there some nice female full frontal nudity as well as male full frontal nudity for some reason i found the stories to be very well written and the director succeeds entirely in setting up each story with its surprising twist and the gory aftermath br br note review of the german dvd
<START> there are some stallone movies i like but this movie didn't meet my low expectations i found this movie hard to believe for example a bunch of terrorists who crash land in the wilderness are prepared to survive for at least two days also in all this wilderness stallone and company keep running across bridges and <UNK> that provide convenient short cuts or plot devices also the <UNK> cops don't seem to <UNK> anything with the local rescue people also bad guys who couldn't hit the side of a <UNK> with really high tech looking automatic weapons br br i liked john <UNK> villain initially but the character is such a complete psychopath that he doesn't care at all about any of his own bad guys or all of them getting killed eventually i just couldn't believe the character anymore br br not worth the price of a rental not even worth taking the time to watch
<START> <UNK> was a fun movie and some of the songs were really great <UNK> was very entertaining i don't normally like music things like this but the singing was not lame like it looked like on the box the movie was useful for learning about history because it was an interesting perspective of the <UNK> <UNK> of 1976 it showed you things from the perspective of the students in the <UNK> and showed you that they were real characters because you got to see them as real characters this makes you like them more as an audience and makes you more sympathetic to them as totally the victims of the white government who you can not <UNK> with the singing of the students is correct because we know from accounts that the students in the riot were singing and dancing before it became violent the clothing of the students in <UNK> is very similar to the clothing shown in photos from <UNK> they made the movie actually in <UNK> which is why it looks very accurate in many parts all these things make the film more accurate for someone using it to learn about <UNK> as viewers we must be critical of the way the history of apartheid was presented as i said before you become sympathetic to the students this makes it potentially less reliable and objective also it changes some of the details from other accounts in <UNK> it turns to chaos when the policeman comes into their <UNK> and shoots the students the police and army were very aggressive at <UNK> but this is probably an exaggerated event the police and army did shoot students but there is not evidence of them going into schools and <UNK> people like this the fighting was more in the streets and had <UNK> and crime this is done in the movie probably to make you feel more sorry for the school students the movie would have been more useful if it had some different information about <UNK> the teacher was arrested for being against the government and the mum goes to work in a white persons house but there is not any information about the government and why they were doing it or any details about the racist <UNK> and laws by george s chris and <UNK>
<START> the movie was completely misleading and the bonus material confirmed my impression that it was a rip off of <UNK> <UNK> heart of darkness the river is replaced by a road and the boat becomes a <UNK> and walter <UNK> is <UNK> br br the claims made on the outside of the dvd box was overt fraud to br br take this <UNK> death of a journalist and present it as factual br br while some portions have muslims supporting the 9 11 attacks for the <UNK> treatment of muslims around the world br br i <UNK> the video store that the movie should be removed from their documentary section and be placed in the war drama area for quasi fictional accounts of actual events
<START> i have been familiar with the fantastic book of <UNK> mister <UNK> for absolutely ages and it was only recently when i got the chance to watch this adaption of it i have heard lots of positive remarks about this so i had high hopes once this film had finished i was horrified br br this film is not a good film at all <UNK> mister <UNK> was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4 5 10 of the book was missed out particularly i found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this there was not much dialogue it was rushed and far too fast moving but i was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between william <UNK> and tom in this film which was a true let down the casting was not all that good either i thought this could have been really good but it was so different to the book <UNK> poor adaption one of the worst i've seen this deserves a decent remake <UNK> better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage
<START> dick tracy is one of my all time favorite films i must admit to those that haven't seen it you will either really love it or really hate it it came out a year after the success of batman so everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple but its based on a comic strip what did you expect <UNK> this movie is amazing the sets make up music costumes and the impressive acting make this film fantastic the film has <UNK> violence and no bad language that's something rare these days directed produced and stars warren beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against al <UNK> evil big boy <UNK> and his mob of thugs madonna steals the show as the seductive breathless <UNK> this is one of the best characters madonna has ever played she has the best one liners i've heard madonna fans would love it one of the coolest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip this film is truly a piece of artwork that is sadly overlooked by the public to sum things up this film brings out the child in all of us it's a film that will leave you smiling at the end
<START> what a complete piece of trash plot notwithstanding when a movie's action revolves around <UNK> you'd think the writers producers director or anyone would do a little bit of <UNK> as to at least a few of the details the mistakes were so glaring that i was <UNK> by the end of the movie here are just a few i'm glad i missed the sr <UNK> sequence certain to have been worse than the air force one f <UNK> spectacle commercial <UNK> usually have their <UNK> painted on the aircraft rather than <UNK> <UNK>  likely the cheap use of some <UNK> advertising publicity footage by the director exposed <UNK> connected by wire nuts is mediocre at best for house <UNK> much less multi million dollar aircraft <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like the <UNK> rely on pressure alone rather than <UNK> supply <UNK> to maintain <UNK> air and if they did rely on an on board supply the <UNK> would be far bigger than fist sized medical tape is not a suitable substitute for a <UNK> <UNK> connection those were f <UNK> not f <UNK> <UNK> 1 speed of sound would be difficult to <UNK> on a static engine run up for <UNK> watch the <UNK> <UNK> standard <UNK> is simply keeping the <UNK> inside one <UNK> mile route <UNK> is what they were flying not the most useful <UNK> for an <UNK> <UNK> missile lock is not likely to get an <UNK> <UNK> attention they have no radar <UNK> or <UNK> wait for my <UNK> is not inter flight communication for preparing to fire anything <UNK> from a door opening in flight is not grounds for an immediate <UNK> left bank yelling into a <UNK> does not make it <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are given as <UNK> not <UNK> and <UNK> are between <UNK> and <UNK> degrees <UNK> in the air are just like <UNK> on the ground so turning left not <UNK>  that's a boat thing from a bearing of <UNK> to <UNK> is just stupid it is in most cases impossible to just turn the <UNK> left until the correct heading is reached  that sort of thing will result in <UNK> degree rolls until the <UNK> is centered again the <UNK> of a flight attendant immediately finding and successfully engaging the <UNK> is only slightly greater than the <UNK> of her actually landing the jet safely <UNK> don't <UNK> immediately upon pulling the <UNK> back and <UNK> have more than one little <UNK> to control the multi engine thrust <UNK> are <UNK> in <UNK> usually just prior to and immediately following landing gear <UNK> not seconds before landing good way to crash wheel <UNK> are required to stop an airplane simply pulling the <UNK> s this time a different <UNK> in the movie to <UNK> will just allow you to go off the end of the <UNK> at a slower speed did i mention that those fighter aircraft were f <UNK> and not f <UNK> guess i <UNK> and that's just what i remember from recently watching this horrific movie
<START> the unborn is a roger corman production and as such is nasty and tasteless if you hate pregnant women check out this movie because it's chock full of <UNK> killings and failed <UNK> brooke adams stars as virginia her and her square of a husband go to some fancy <UNK> clinic because they can't have kids on their own there they meet dr <UNK> james karen of <UNK> 1 2 dr <UNK> has had a very high success rate at getting couples pregnant insert joke here is it because he's creating some genetic killer <UNK> babies that's what virginia starts to think when she starts having some odd side effects and extreme <UNK> from the treatment that's when she starts taking matters into her own hands br br on this one you'll have to get the rest of the details somewhere else because if i told ya all the <UNK> this one had you might hurt yourself putting it on your netflix rental <UNK> too quickly it's a bit slow moving for a while but once it picks up in the final third all systems are go very highly recommended by me on the strengths of its un pc <UNK> violence 33 1 2 out of <UNK> stars
<START> as alan <UNK> breakfast of <UNK> <UNK> into theaters with little <UNK> and much <UNK> it makes me think back to 1996 when keith <UNK> mother night came out now for all the talk of kurt <UNK> being <UNK> it's surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic <UNK> the other being slaughter house five mother night is certainly one of the most <UNK> films of the decade and i cannot understand why it's brilliant it stays almost entirely faithful to <UNK> book without being stilted or overly literary and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic how many film adaptations of any author's work can claim that <UNK> himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film and can you ask for a better <UNK> than that not only is it a beautiful film it is a beautifully acted written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so american films of the 1990s it's a <UNK> inspired surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected i would sincerely encourage anyone to see mother night it doesn't even take a <UNK> with <UNK> work to fully appreciate it as slaughter house five sometimes does it is a powerful affecting piece of cinema
<START> i know i know plan 9 from outer space is the worst movie or maybe <UNK> the hands of fate but i can't get worked up over those <UNK> monkey movies of course they're bad how could they be any good but if you're talking about movies with respectable production values and <UNK> talent the t rex of all <UNK> has to be <UNK> all the <UNK> <UNK> all the self absorbed <UNK> that <UNK> everything barbra streisand has done since 1964 reaches its <UNK> in this movie from its lonely <UNK> of awfulness <UNK> looks back to a star is born and forward to the mirror has two faces there is nothing else quite like it what emotional <UNK> dragged streisand out to make this movie i would rather not <UNK> and what audience she was playing to i cannot possibly imagine although i'll bet there's a nine in ten chance you aren't a member of it br br <UNK> prize winner and <UNK> guardian of <UNK> literature <UNK> <UNK> singer was so <UNK> by what streisand did to his story that he <UNK> her in public for it it is a tribute to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that she not only didn't commit suicide but went on to make more awful movies
<START> <UNK> review of this cheap <UNK> hits the nail <UNK> on the head make sure you read it in case you don't a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the pacific <UNK> to <UNK> around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard the big foot family doesn't take kindly to this and proceeds to pick off the team one by one largely <UNK> big foot himself has a distinctly ape like face but is less scary overall than harry from harry and the <UNK> most of the movie has the wooden generic actors pretending to be scientists <UNK> around in the woods and <UNK> away this is a no budget movie in which very little happens at least on screen we do get to watch the <UNK> of the females take a shower while one of her male companions watches but nothing comes of this
<START> <UNK> where do i start with this god awful movie bad bad bad story telling i do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie <UNK> london was quite an enjoyable movie to be honest even the soundtrack was good but in this one oh my good for a movie which is supposed to be a musical one the songs are <UNK> bad <UNK> <UNK> should have been the music director br br given two great actors a much better job should have been done by the director even though the first half sucks the last 30 mins of the movie are ok performances from salman and ajay save the movie from being a total disaster br br watch it if you have nothing better to do the last good movie from bollywood i watched and i do watch a load of them is <UNK> d and wake up sid
<START> so i consider myself pretty big into the anime scene with very few shows i simply will not watch br br this show however i would recommend to anyone br br quite possibly the most original series to date it s got just about everything i could ask for a side story so to speak about an <UNK> love that will not be admitted to a very blatant comedy and a very well put together voice acting cast both japanese and american translation br br if not for the terribly funny aspect to it it would be just another anime br br more or less as i have noticed a <UNK> it or hate <UNK> very few people i have seen introduced to this series will end up with a <UNK> for it br br original to the core with everything you could ask for in an afternoon bet the house on this series i'm ready to assure you that you will enjoy it
<START> as a young boy i always sort of hated cinderella since i was <UNK> by my two sisters when my parents were considering what disney movie to buy i wanted <UNK> but my sisters won out and we got cinderella they thoroughly enjoyed the movie while i <UNK> in the back of the room playing with my star wars action figures br br a lot has changed since then my love of the disney theme parks landed me an <UNK> at walt disney world and i now have two young <UNK> i like to showcase disney to them as much as i can and we recently watched cinderella together with my <UNK> appreciation for all that is disney i watched cinderella with a new perspective and was impressed with what i saw br br from the beginning of the movie though i didn't quite understand why cinderella was trapped in such a horrible <UNK> why was she such a slave to her <UNK> and why couldn't she just run away i wasn't too sympathetic to cinderella but as the story progressed i found myself becoming immersed in the story maybe the eye catching animation or the fun loving characters drew me in or maybe it was the timeless songs listening to songs like <UNK> <UNK> boo and a dream is a wish your heart makes sort of <UNK> me back to the theme parks i can picture myself in that <UNK> and fun atmosphere while looking at the awe inspiring cinderella castle br br something about this movie just evokes the magic of disney that may make many people <UNK> but go to the magic kingdom and see all the little girls dressed up like cinderella that are excited to be in this fantasy world and you'll know what i'm talking about the images of cinderella and the glass <UNK> as well as mickey mouse <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> why disney is one of the most beloved companies in the entire world br br while cinderella may not be the strongest story it is sort of iconic in disney and movie history it represents that fun idealistic and fantasy like <UNK> we held when we were kids i imagine this movie holds a lot of meaning to many many people out there it may not be my favorite disney movie but it does represent all that i love and admire about the company br br my imdb rating 10 10 my <UNK> grade a outstanding
<START> are we talking about the same movie this movie is totally ridiculous the plot is disgusting and completely without logic its a typical straight to dvd tv movie including all the necessary ingredients for a horrible movie experience over acting by has been actors side steps from the plot that are left unexplained the girl shows her t <UNK> why god why people do not react to things as they would in real life i'm not even gonna bother you with details it would take all night well ok just one if two people were murdered in front of you as you were walking down the street one of the victims practically dies in your arms his blood <UNK> from his head wound all over you would your first concern be oh he left the world and the last thing he saw was my angry face my thoughts goes to harvey and his lost career
<START> i suppose bad laurel and hardy is better than no laurel and hardy at all but just barely it's sad that the fox films are the ones getting a big release on dvd exposing people who may not be too familiar with l h to their worst stuff rather than their classic comedies br br once again the boys are <UNK> with a dumb romantic plot about a guy who's invented an invisible ray he's in love with the <UNK> daughter who hates him and prefers some slick guy it's incredible to think the geniuses at fox thought this is what l h needed in their films br br without their <UNK> makeup the boys look tired and old the only scenes that work for them in this picture is when they try to sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene where robert mitchum being a classic noir bad guy tries to sell oliver hardy insurance on stan br br otherwise this script is just a mess forget this and see if you can find a copy of a <UNK> at <UNK> or <UNK> girl or sons of the desert instead
<START> i was lucky enough to attend a screening in <UNK> for this <UNK> expressed enjoyable and thought provoking film with romance as the <UNK> weapon in its <UNK> paris je t'aime <UNK> <UNK> into love in paris <UNK> the different forms in <UNK> separate <UNK> but without <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> its <UNK> undoubtedly <UNK> from frustration on the <UNK> parts  frustration over only having 5 10 minutes of screen time  thereby you are only presented with the best and most assured direction from each party br br <UNK> whether or not i should review all 18 segments i reached the conclusion that it would be merely redundant and long <UNK> instead simply rest assured that each director <UNK> the film with their eccentric styles and skills and certainly you'll find your favourite although gus van <UNK> cannot resist the temptation to be <UNK> his les <UNK> is one of the better <UNK> even <UNK> in a well placed kurt <UNK> reference the <UNK> brothers recreate one of the more accessible segments in paris a scene with a muted but emotionally transparent steve <UNK> deadpan humour and clever camera angles that surely generated the most laughter in my theatre and perhaps rightly so br br in this way all story lines are <UNK> unique  <UNK> through the minds of different directors  but the one that <UNK> the most from the rest is vincenzo <UNK> <UNK> de la madeleine a dark horror gothic love starring <UNK> wood as a lost tourist in the <UNK> of paris in the night who meets a <UNK> with a black and white format but blood red colour contrast that seems to <UNK> bleed off screen it nearly becomes a <UNK> of sin city  a refreshing eerie and visual turn in an otherwise fairly grounded film br br yet my single favourite segment was <UNK> saint denis by tom <UNK> but i think i was <UNK> to think so given that i went in the theatre with him as my favourite and <UNK> my friend in the side saying finally that's my favourite director here nevertheless it cannot be denied that <UNK> delivers a lovely segment in which a blind boy picks up the phone and hears from his girlfriend portman for once not annoying that she breaks up with him and he reflects on their relationship as is <UNK> style the story is <UNK> fast paced <UNK> and repetitive featuring screaming and running lola <UNK> making it the most <UNK> <UNK> segment in paris je t'aime and possibly also the most touching once <UNK> starts wielding his most powerful tool  music br br to fill the negative account clearly not all directors manage as touching as <UNK> van <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the bottom of the pile by <UNK> out a truly <UNK> segment in which a little boy <UNK> the story of how his parents met they are two lonely <UNK> this part is so in your face french and desperately quirky that it is insulting to international viewers <UNK> also directs a poor and <UNK> segment with an unusually <UNK> looking juliette <UNK> whom <UNK> the loss of her son nothing else happens finally the wrap up and <UNK> of the 18 stories in the end feels somewhat rushed and half hearted br br yet paris je t'aime truly <UNK> you with quality for all the other stories are well crafted with crisp acting and amusing writing it is certainly one of the highlights of 2006 not saying much i suppose and a very personal film in the sense that it is <UNK> to pick a favourite and a least favourite highly recommended both to mainstream of pretentious <UNK> audiences br br 8 out 10
<START> so the other night i decided to watch tales from the hollywood hills <UNK> jackson or power passion murder as it is called in holland when i bought the film i noticed that michelle pfeiffer was starring in it and i thought that had to say something about the quality unfortunately it didn't br br 1 the plot of the film is really confusing there are two story lines running simultaneously during the film only they have nothing in common throughout the entire movie i was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me but it still hasn't br br 2 the title of the film says the film will be about <UNK> jackson well it is sometimes like said the film covers two different stories and the part about <UNK> jackson is the <UNK> so another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice br br to conclude my story i really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it by doing this you won't waste 90 minutes of your life as i did
<START> <UNK> game is a charming wonderful movie from an era gone by hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie my wife and i would go see it br br it is an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and i watched on <UNK> br br this movie has tony randall at his best debbie reynolds is great as always br br loved it we plan on <UNK> on dvd to add to our growing collection of movies br br too bad hollywood does not make movies like this anymore br br hey hollywood time to dig some of these type of scripts out of the old safe update them a bit without spoiling the original movie and script as you have done with other remakes and hold a casting call br br a remake would be a big hit on the silver screen dvd and on cable <UNK> br br <UNK> austin <UNK>
<START> this movie has great style fantastic visuals and hot sex scenes with a beautiful woman it <UNK> at the end as the story twists get a little bit extreme but all in all i would recommend this movie just because it has that good old russian feel to it big impressive powerful bleak and brutal and at the same time beautiful in the old tradition of tragic beauty br br plot a guy who can make a blade shoot out of his hand at will not a spoiler since they show it in the trailer when he is really mad at you tries to have a girlfriend he discovers that after you kill one person with your sword hand it's kind of hard to keep a stable relationship br br sword boy is on the planet for a reason he just doesn't know what it is yet br br lots of dark street fights with guys unexpectedly getting <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> w <UNK> subtitles slick worth a watch
<START> rated pg 13 for violence brief sexual humor and drug content <UNK> rating 13 should be g canadian home video rating <UNK> br br i have seen police story a couple of times now in my opinion police story is chan's best film from the 80's he originally made it because he didn't like the other cop film he had to star in which was the <UNK> i have not seen the <UNK> so i cant compare the acting isn't too bad and the plot is pretty good i don't remember the plot well because i saw this film a while back but what i do remember is this film has lots of great action stunts and comedy just what a good chan film needs if you can find police story and you are chan fan then buy this film br br runtime <UNK> br br 9 10
<START> i rented this movie last week i saw kevin spacey and morgan freeman were on it so it seemed promising and it was until justin timberlake came on scene he is a really bad actor and shouldn't be allowed to make a movie ever again i mean he is one of the most boring uninspired actors i've ever seen he puts absolutely no emotion to any of his lines whatsoever why the hell was he cast for the role of josh <UNK> i think matt damon would have been a better choice br br kevin spacey was another big disappointment his character is so dull it seems like a bad mix of his character in american beauty and john <UNK> in <UNK> it might sound cool but believe me it's not br br now dylan <UNK> acting is very good it's about one of the very few good things about this movie he is just inspired br br morgan freeman is good but nothing special he has some really cool lines though br br about the story although it was a bit obvious and exaggerated at times it was good i was expecting a big twist when <UNK> dylan mcdermott was killed but nothing really happened
<START> this whimsical film had the misfortune of being released at the same time of the highly popular <UNK> both having the wonderful audrey <UNK> playing the central role <UNK> <UNK> the talented director made one of the most enjoyable films that have come out of france in recent memory br br the film deals with chance as its english title <UNK> the french title makes reference at how <UNK> wings can create chaos over the atlantic as they fly as well as <UNK> in the pacific something not to be believed just by looking at these colorful insects from the start the director <UNK> all the characters one sees in the film and how each has a connection to the other something that is hard to imagine but in the film's context seems to work well br br a chance meeting at the <UNK> sets the tone for the film irene who is going to work is asked by the woman sitting opposite her to tell her what her zodiac sign is and proceeds to read from her paper irene it seems will cross paths and will find her soul mate that same day after irene leaves the train the quiet young man <UNK> next to the woman tells her he has the same birth date as irene it seems they are destined to one another from the start but alas they will not <UNK> until the last frame of the film br br audrey <UNK> is wonderful as irene <UNK> who plays <UNK> doesn't have a lot to do until the end but he shows he has a presence and plays well his part the talented young cast makes a valuable contribution to the success of the film which is as light as <UNK> wings br br we look forward to future films by <UNK> <UNK> because he appears to be a director with the heart in the right place and an ear to the way humans are connected
<START> the movie and acting are not bad and jay <UNK> does a good job playing <UNK> <UNK> but the movie forgets it's suppose to be a prequel to a hit movie the makers of this prequel clearly did not watch the original carlito's way or at least did not care about continuity this movie is a prequel which means the original movie has already laid out some history for us and this movie should end where the original begins or at least lead up to it not one of carlito's close old friends from the original make an appearance in this movie they're not even mentioned luis <UNK> <UNK> in the original is in the movie but he plays a completely different character the original takes place in 1975 and the prequel takes place in 1969 70 considering this movie takes place less than 5 years earlier wouldn't you think one of carlito's long time friends would make an appearance in the original carlito <UNK> out being released from jail after spending 5 years in jail that's only a few <UNK> between the end of the prequel and the start of the original semi spoiler we know from the beginning of the original carlito has spent 5 years in prison so when the prequel gives us this hollywood happy ending it's an insult to the intelligence of fans of the original what happen to <UNK> it's the lack of continuity that made this film go direct to video release
<START> 1 2 for this diane keaton farce br br someone should tell ms keaton enough with your annie hall philosophy and hats br br this flick is just too much as keaton's daughter sara dies in a traffic accident while her boyfriend survives br br keaton who could not be reached by phone at first as she was in the sack with her pal and had pulled out the phone plug <UNK> in a new way for <UNK> br br she <UNK> to the summer locale where all of <UNK> friends are staying she <UNK> the house sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things which were better not to be revealed it appears that sweet sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who ultimately married the latter in addition she had an abortion thanks to this guy we're all now put on this guilt trip br br her only hope is to find the <UNK> diary that sara kept she also hopes that boyfriend adam who is a playwright will not include all this in another play br br when the diary is found it has been written in japanese sara had a <UNK> d in this language it's not that great news for mom when an <UNK> of the diary is translated by a japanese cook in a japanese restaurant br br naturally everything seems to tie up nicely in the end br br the title of this <UNK> comes from the wizard of oz every time mom and sara would speak they would both utter surrender dorothy br br as if this isn't enough during the course of this bizarre <UNK> of mourning keaton tells adam not to be another woody allen in his film interiors where he tried to successfully <UNK> <UNK> bergman ms keaton also tries drugs with the group come on folks can we realistically believe that anyone in his right mind could <UNK> like this br br fair to mediocre best sums up this film
<START> time is precious this film isn't i must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like <UNK> and this complete waste of time br br the theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction is this the film the critics are raving about what a piece of crap br br the hook of this film is the <UNK> mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family get it br br the acting is superb br br the production lighting sets editing sound is about 2 steps above a 60 minutes story the characters are shallow and <UNK> i was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience the audience was <UNK> to the movie screen what the characters should say next br br i have had more fun doing the <UNK>
<START> i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much it was well acted particularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven <UNK> and jeff <UNK> it was a very interesting movie filled with drama and suspense from the beginning to the very end i <UNK> that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie it is excellent and has great acting
<START> the word in the summary sums it up <UNK> five girls get lost trying to find their way home when they stop at a store to get directions they hit a <UNK> car breaking one <UNK> on it they flea the scene in fair of getting in trouble but suddenly they see one <UNK> coming up behind them <UNK> br br from there out everything is screaming crying and violence when they try to get away from this crazy person who lost it because of a <UNK> well the screaming and crying pretty much stays through the entire movie very annoying the movie is shot with a cheap camera trying to make it seem real or shocking i guess it's just embarrassing and useless though in lack of anything better to compare it with blair witch style br br the screaming and crying for pretty much the entire movie with crappy sound was over the top annoying you literally get a headache br br i'm sorry but this was not scary only an annoying painful piece of crap movie
<START> after the superb <UNK> 2002 which was a remake of a <UNK> play he comes with <UNK> which too looks like a stage play br br in stage plays we have characters shouting overacting here too the same br br the first half shows amitabh almost kidding the 40 akshay kumar who acts too funny like a small nerd br br the film has a good message how not to spoil your son but sadly the way amitabh wants to make <UNK> responsible is absolutely fake br br even his reason for hiding his sickness his <UNK> from the hospital and the melodramatic speech by <UNK> is a put off br br some emotions do touch you but most are too over the top br br <UNK> comedy is hilarious but too stretched in second half br br direction by <UNK> shah is too overdone though some scenes are good music is okay br br amongst actors amitabh <UNK> it in the first half but is superb in emotional scenes akshay kumar too does his part well but looks <UNK> in some too <UNK> scenes his chemistry with bachchan is <UNK> <UNK> is a highlight he makes you laugh without overacting and just his presence and his dumb behaviour and deadpan humour he is a riot <UNK> is good in some comic parts but too loud at places <UNK> is the heroine so nothing to do this is her last film with <UNK> so far <UNK> is awesome though she looks too young for bachchan
<START> this film is one of tom <UNK> finest films he captures the audiences <UNK> with his role of david <UNK> his character can relate to us all in some way the story line is very clever and keeps the audience on edge throughout the whole film i never really watched cruise movies that much before but after seeing this it shows me his true talent my favourite part in the movie is the end where it all comes to a big conclusion and he find out the truth if you have not seen this yet you definitely should give it a try it's one of those films that once you've started watching it you just got to see it until the end or it will keep you thinking and you will regret it my opinion is you should just go buy it and take a risk thats what i did and it became one of my favourite films of all time it's a 10 10 i promise once you watch it it will stick with you and you will like it forever
<START> my friends and i saw this film about a week ago and i feel it absolutely necessary to tell all the world or at least those who will read this that this movie is not only on the top five worst movies i have ever seen but actually has the honor of being the number one i have seen quite a lot of films but none beats this one in being stupid you could say i suffered watching it my only excuse is that we were waiting for a few hours and weren't able to go anywhere else without <UNK> our <UNK> off i do not recommend this to anyone at first i thought we were watching some really bad porn movie but figured out after 10 minutes that is not the case it is not a comedy it is not drama it is not action it is not horror it is just horrible
<START> <UNK> glad that someone has made a movie about how hard it is to risk your heart for a second time or third this movie is exactly what it promises to be lovely amusing and it gives you this good feeling around your heart when it ends the plot might be not very inventive but there are millions of ways to tell the story and they have not been all used yet the cast is perfectly selected although scott wolf does not look like a father of an eight year old not even when he is wearing a suit so the sparks are on all the right places supporting cast is <UNK> supporting and although you could probably predict the whole movie you would not want to switch the channel it is just the right sort of entertainment for a sunday evening
<START> 9 the film i've been looking forward to for months was little more then a disappointment br br i was deeply surprised by <UNK> lack of story and strange character development all the awesome action sequences in the world don't make up for a single unsympathetic character br br the strange almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place they were <UNK> the story is about robots and scientists why does it suddenly turn into a <UNK> horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been excellently scary story devices br br how what when why questions that <UNK> asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will as you get away from the theater br br a film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth i would watch this film drawn in <UNK> if the story was good but the filmmakers have relied on cgi <UNK> and tim <UNK> name to draw in the crowd which is what drew me in but failed to gain my respect br br 9 could have been awesome with a few more <UNK> and a little more respect from its own creators
<START> this game is the bomb and this is the <UNK> game of the year and should be on greatest hits when i got agent under fire i thought that was a good game but then <UNK> came around and that was better but now there is a new type of james bond game this time it a 3rd person <UNK> and there is more than 12 missions the graphics of the game are out of this house it even has all of the great actors and actresses in this game like pierce <UNK> as once again james bond william dafoe as the villain <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as m forgive me all if i spell it wrong this game would be own as the greatest james bond game around br br i give this a 10 10
<START> may contain spoilers so i watched this movie last night on <UNK> lifetime movie network which is not known for showing quality movies this movie is awful i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing as it was terrible could this movie contain any more stereotypes <UNK> jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor catholic family with priest sons big big <UNK> in every room shown in the catholic family's house mexican <UNK> bad guy who is really a <UNK> at heart incredibly bad country accents gag i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were in it i decided to stay awake until <UNK> to watch it anyway the only redeeming thing about this movie is <UNK> <UNK> beauty i suppose <UNK> and <UNK> acting is okay but they have a horrid script to work with unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of <UNK> accents the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a <UNK> i think that the accents were there in supporting characters like mary <UNK> date and john and were unnecessary they were also very very bad i am so very tired of hollywood southern accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town the beautiful <UNK> building the <UNK> tower lit up for a winning football game etc none of these things were there also it takes about 5 6 hours to drive to mexico from austin at one point in the movie michael and his <UNK> take off for mexico to lose their <UNK> and are able to drive off when it is dark during the summer and early fall it doesn't get dark in austin until <UNK> or so spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican is there any other kind <UNK> and then return to austin by dawn while this is <UNK> possible it is not very likely and if anyone has started school in the hill country usually the third week of august but may have been in september in 1960 they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they do not wear their letter <UNK> in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90 degrees only people with no body <UNK> would be stupid enough to wear <UNK> or letter <UNK> on the first day of school all in all a very bad made for tv movie experience
<START> this was a movie i could not wait to see so i finally got it and i was pretty disappointed for starters the movie has so little said about new york just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings streets bridges and <UNK> it really doesn't stay focused on the new york magic another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie i know that it is a remake but it is not a french style remake anyway here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies such as long and messy scenes no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style the story follows many lives too many for my taste and they somehow seem connected in the end i feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories the movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyone's happy ending so we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each and there you have your <UNK> minutes if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you i give it 4 just because i love new york and i loved the cast
<START> this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments i loved the character of matt and also tiny they seemed the most engaging and funny characters and certainly the most interesting matt is very good as is his no good cousin and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor eric <UNK> my personal favourite part was the <UNK> scene loved that overall i liked the film and it'll get about an 8 rating the penalty however i was disappointed in it was a side foot <UNK> rather than the appropriate <UNK> blast br br i am of course kidding
<START> what a bad bad movie i tried watching without fast <UNK> that failed after about 30 minutes i stopped the movie went on line to see how many minutes this disaster was only <UNK> minutes <UNK> it was a confusing boring movie i don't think anyone can get knocked down by getting hit with a <UNK> <UNK> much less <UNK> by one the one funny thing is that i watched the killer cut version of the movie the box <UNK> states more blood more sex more terror than the theatrical release <UNK> if this movie was horrible with all those claims i wonder just how lame the un killer cut was if you want to see a great movie about the world of the living the world of the dead watch any of the night of the living dead series
<START> <UNK> is the great achievement of michael <UNK> this masterful play is masterfully adapted for the screen and brought to life by a wonderful cast <UNK> achieved the impossible he managed to film a greek tragedy to screen without losing its <UNK> and importance a stellar greek cast helps him in this newcomer <UNK> <UNK> is extremely impressive as <UNK> equally impressive is irene <UNK> who even though she sometimes seems over the top it is very realistic a wonderful greek film beautifully adapted and directed by michael <UNK> with an excellent music score by <UNK> <UNK> which is ideal in every scene br br p s <UNK> say that the film lost the best foreign language film oscar by only 1 vote
<START> this movie stinks i don't think i have ever seen a movie so strung up on shock value the plot was relatively interesting but the dialog was super flat and the acting was bland this could have been an a good movie i think it just relied on it's grotesque visuals i can usually handle graphic scenes and human <UNK> but it felt like miike shot it for the sake of shooting it just one poorly executed film there just isn't anything to be entertained by watching this film unless you are fascinated by <UNK> yourself with explicit scenes of incest <UNK> <UNK> rape self <UNK> <UNK> and sibling abuse and <UNK> <UNK> i think i just sold the film to many of you but i meant it when i said this stinks he has succeeded in other films but i think you'd be better off watching someone <UNK>
<START> do not expect a depiction of the truth however the accounts of these veterans of the <UNK> afghanistan wars demand thoughtful consideration br br the major strength of the film is that it vividly portrays the words and war wounds of these vets and their post war struggles to <UNK> some degree of <UNK> and <UNK> to their lives br br my major criticism of the film is <UNK> it is one sided and it <UNK> anti war <UNK> but nothing more to correct the serious shortcomings of the <UNK> and veterans <UNK> programs for helping those who've suffered and still suffer the <UNK> of war these are not fatal flaws of the film br br as a veteran myself i know that the horrible aftermath of war is real and these young men and women <UNK> it very well these vets vividly describe the physical and mental pain and torment that most veterans experience and that ordinary people need to understand because the horrors of all wars are so traumatic and disturbing

<START> clint eastwood is <UNK> billy the leader of a wild west <UNK> one of six regular <UNK> who <UNK> a struggling to break even <UNK> show the seventh member of the bunch is a woman <UNK> assistant but such women never last long and the position is <UNK> open enter <UNK> <UNK> sandra locke  eastwood's girlfriend at the time it seems miss <UNK> as doc <UNK> <UNK> calls her is a would be <UNK> who will only receive her long deceased father's estate if she's married by the time she turns 30 so on the eve of that birthday she gets <UNK> to the cartoonish geoffrey lewis br br so what's the plot of this film it's hard to say there's the romantic tension between billy and miss <UNK> but the problem is that for the first half of the movie she's so <UNK> insipid and <UNK> that when she suddenly becomes <UNK> of the <UNK> halfway through the film it's not only unbelievable but the audience is well past caring about her there's the <UNK> lack of <UNK> behind the wild west show but this topic isn't touched upon enough to really be the <UNK> <UNK> of the film there's miss <UNK> <UNK> of being stranded in the rural west cut off from the <UNK> that fuel her spoiled life of luxury she's <UNK> believed to be dead by her family and the press but are we really supposed to believe that she couldn't get back to new york and her waiting fortune if she gave it a bit of effort br br no the point of this film seems to be that billy is the leader of a family a lovable bunch of losers who hang together through thick and thin this is a warm fuzzy film  or at least tries to be br br along the way clint shows us his skills with a gun even <UNK> a bank robbery in a shooting that is <UNK> out of place in an otherwise relatively non violent film one of the gang is arrested on an old draft <UNK> charge billy <UNK> the local sheriff the show's <UNK> burns down an <UNK> makes them a new one but numerous mundane <UNK> do not a plot make br br <UNK> the problem is the acting or lack thereof aside from <UNK> <UNK> the supporting cast is quite amateurish eastwood isn't on top of his game either though he looks better simply by virtue of being surrounded by such a lackluster bunch br br and for all this the film <UNK> on for <UNK> minutes to what point good question  br br 4 out of 10
<START> if i had never read the book i would have said it was a good movie but i did read the book who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline there is so many changes that it wasn't really worthy of the title character changes plot changes time line changes br br first off who was henry and the investigator they weren't in the story henry had <UNK> persona somewhat but mitch wasn't a cop no you made it so <UNK> helped <UNK> ' his body and used that as <UNK> blackmail against <UNK> the real so called blackmail was <UNK> thought <UNK> was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him her son was also being <UNK> because he was hiding being gay from his mother her son wasn't even really mentioned in the story neither i don't believe was his lover <UNK> secretary br br tony and west were not together in the beginning he was actually with <UNK> first while in college the black painted apartment was their idea tony just went to visit this is where <UNK> and tony meet become fast friends tony hides her love for west then <UNK> left west with cash from tony then west and tony get together eventually marry at some point west leaves tony for <UNK> again for a short time only to be heart broken again then go back to tony <UNK> blackmail for tony was that tony had written a test paper for <UNK> now being a professor at college she didn't want to let it get out i will say the character who played tony did it wonderfully br br <UNK> character was a blond not that it really matters <UNK> didn't trick her about having cancer while <UNK> was alive no she was there when <UNK> had a lover named billy <UNK> father he was a draft <UNK> in the vietnam war eventually after <UNK> takes care of <UNK> for months for what was actually drug <UNK> <UNK> and billy have an affair right under <UNK> nose while taking care of them both then <UNK> turns in billy to the government and leaves on the ferry with him not with <UNK> <UNK> was pregnant with her tho <UNK> also had a split personality karen was her real name br br <UNK> did not die from being cut up into <UNK> she fell or was possibly pushed we never really knew off the balcony and landed in a <UNK> she had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she <UNK> she was also really <UNK> of cancer this time around br br it didn't show any of the childhood memories or anything that <UNK> the characters to the reader the book was <UNK> down to its bare bones then re made in someone else's vision why couldn't you just write your own story along the lines of what you made the movie it was different enough and i'm sure could have been made more so
<START> look i'm reading and reading this comments and there's a lot of it that i wanna say but i will try to make it short but clean br br first of all lets forget all of the things how bad this movie was made how it didn't show anything of notorious and i agree with the most people here saying that it was hollywood i mean what did you expect a real life story when will people wake up and see that u will never ever find the real truth about <UNK> and <UNK> its all covered up and buried deep down br br second i'm not against neither <UNK> or <UNK> i love them both but <UNK> and <UNK> kim did get embarrassed in this movie for sure br br next for all of ya that are saying that the movie is awesome and cant see the truth either u are too blind too see it because u think u know something about big or you don't know anything about him at all and u love this hollywood teenage movies use your mind and see though the clouds there is a lot of it you could say when it gets to this topic i did not say 60 of what i have to say because its a very wide topic but for the movie i can only say that it could have been a little bit i mean a much better done but anyways i'm just some person giving her opinion no hard feelings br br look i love hip hop and i live for it but after seeing this movie every person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how someone is suppose to live with all do respect for <UNK> and big like all the other artists who are making for a living like this should turn the other page because u are ruining the youth bringing the wrong message to the children and that is not going to school but living from the streets <UNK> and just grabbing for the paper br br the true hip hop is suppose to be about love and intelligence be smart and all br br ok i know that many of you will think that i'm crazy but this is just my point of view look i am maybe wrong about something and im not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if i'm in hip hop for 17 18 years i still don't know anything bout <UNK> or <UNK> no matter how many <UNK> i read or how much i support them and listen to their music like most of you all out there only people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this br br and for the end i just wanna say for all of ya <UNK> and <UNK> fans and family this two men were and will be the greatest of all time no matter how they lived their lives but please in the future try to be better learn and love each other think good even for the ones that don't like you because at the end its not about how many money or fame u could get and how fast u could get to the top its about <UNK> your self to the <UNK> and feeding your soul your body and mind because if u manage to do that you will be living a life even after death peace and love to ya all rip <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> left eye jam master jay and the others who make a change in this world
<START> this columbo episode is probably noted more for the director steven spielberg as one of his early films it should be looked at for jack <UNK> role as the murderer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle jack cassidy would appear in a later columbo after all columbo meets his match in jack <UNK> character he is a mystery writer who plots to perform the perfect murder after his first murder his next victim would be the annoying general store owner widow who would blackmail him for money rather than losing more money he kills her it is very entertaining to watch cassidy and falk as always <UNK> <UNK> as columbo makes him watchable after viewing this episode repeatedly over the years what television today forgets about the success of years is that people will want to watch the shows again and again if they like the characters it's not about who does it how and why it the <UNK> of columbo and his <UNK> which scores high with viewers like myself
<START> this is a <UNK> old fashioned adventure yarn i understand that by today's political standards the treatment of the indians was <UNK> but this moving isn't about politics it's about action dialogue <UNK> acting direction music and photography and it's marvelous on all these factors grant fairbanks and mclaglen are electric together and <UNK> is superb this is the ultimate buddy movie
<START> what an extraordinary crime thriller my wife and i saw this at the toronto international film festival last week and it was far and away the best movie in an exceptionally strong festival it's already my second favourite film of all time after dr <UNK> and i was definitely on an emotional high as i walked home and discussed the film with my wife br br i don't want to spoil the plot because thrillers of this <UNK> are best enjoyed without <UNK> a synopsis that i'd feel comfortable sharing is that two brothers played by phillip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke are planning to rob a <UNK> store in <UNK> new york the film <UNK> back and forth in time over approximately a two week period of time before during and after the robbery and one key scene is repeated at least three times <UNK> that could <UNK> the momentum of a film but that never happens during this masterpiece the excitement the tension and even the quality of the acting only seemed to get better as the film progressed by the end i was on the edge of my seat <UNK> waiting to see how it would all wrap up i know that i've used a few clichés in this post but i literally was on the edge of my seat i should mention that the non linear storyline is quite easy to follow this isn't the sort of movie where you'll <UNK> audience members asking their friend to explain the plot during the movie br br the acting is absolutely brilliant all around and i doubt i would have the same admiration for the film if the casting hadn't been so perfect a tiny complaint is that hoffman and hawke don't look like brothers but that's a minor <UNK> that i can easily overlook hoffman was at his very best and some of his scenes with hawke were positively electric marisa tomei as <UNK> wife and albert finney as the father of hoffman hawke are also very good in supporting roles even some cameo performances were so impressive that i can still remember every remark gesture and facial expression by brian <UNK> and michael shannon  absolute perfection the robbery scene felt more authentic than any other cinematic robbery scene i've ever watched and i had the same feeling of authenticity in most scenes especially the ones with hoffman the music helped to build up the tension throughout the movie often the same notes played over very effectively i had the music playing in my head the following day even as i sat through other films in addition to my minor complaint at the beginning of this paragraph there was one plot twist that felt a bit unbelievable major spoiler so i can't describe the scene otherwise this film is pretty darn close to perfect br br there were about a dozen great films at the festival that i would enjoy watching a second time but before the devil knows you're dead stands in a league of its own as an aside the director sidney lumet spoke before the film and he introduced marisa tomei and ethan hawke onto the stage tomei didn't speak and she acted a bit shy so lumet asked can you believe that someone so beautiful could be so camera shy that comment is quite ironic considering the graphic opening scene
<START> jackie chan name is <UNK> to stunts this movie never let you down the opening best chase scene and last roll down scene from the pole is so <UNK> than one wonder if he knows the meaning of fear this movie comes very close to <UNK> best which is project a but the main difference being that project a contains three stars where as in this movie jackie carries the film entirely on his shoulders this is perhaps the main reason that this movie made jackie an biggest martial arts star followed by bruce lee the film has nice comic touches too what makes this film work is <UNK> ability to show his <UNK> side which his in contract to the typical martial arts action hero this movie was followed by a sequel which was good but was quite tame in comparison to its predecessor

<START> you have to understand when <UNK> was released in 1983 it created a generation of wannabe computer <UNK> the idea that a teenager could do anything of far reaching proportions let alone <UNK> a world war was novel and thrilling real computers were beginning to show up in people's homes and for the first time society was becoming <UNK> in a way that made the movie's premise <UNK> <UNK> granted a talking computer that balanced it's free time between chess and global <UNK> war was a bit far fetched but the brilliant commentary on nuclear <UNK> and the cold war made up for it i've probably even heard of the <UNK> that this movie was actually based on br br fast forward 25 years and we have a horrible mutant of a thing that i <UNK> to call a sequel called <UNK> the dead code i'll just dig right in first of all the plot <UNK> on a government <UNK> gambling site where folks who win the games automatically become terror suspects you're probably very confused right now the idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the sub game within the web site called the dead code where they pilot a plane over a city <UNK> it with <UNK> at some point in the game you have to choose between <UNK> gas and <UNK> and if you choose <UNK> then you're automatically confirmed as a <UNK> weapons expert and your family is taken into custody and <UNK> in the movie this actually happens however since the <UNK> for the game was made from a bank account that was suspicious it obviously all makes sense br br second the <UNK> of the <UNK> in this straight to dvd bomb is an annoying flash animation that keeps repeating the pop up ad esquire sound bite play with me baby because apparently in the future advanced <UNK> loses interest in intellectual <UNK> like chess and gets into porn br br third the motivation for these <UNK> is profit and women as opposed to pure curiosity as in the original movie for some reason recent <UNK> movies feel the need to portray all young adults as average <UNK> dude kind of people who are just like everyone else that may work for your average sitcom but c'mon you don't learn how to take over government computers by doing your hair playing sports and shopping at the mall folks the one novel thing i noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a matt damon movie and then later there is the phrase good hunting will i swear they named the main character will just for that phrase so they could send a high five to mr damon this will kid isn't bad but he was certainly wasn't like any obsessive <UNK> i've ever met i can't fully state how annoyed i am that this movie shares the same name as the original because it has absolutely nothing in common with it <UNK> professor <UNK> and joshua <UNK> make a <UNK> in this movie as a limp old man who apparently is dying of boredom and a <UNK> old <UNK> <UNK> toe machine with a higher pitched voice after some <UNK> joshua the <UNK> has what appears to be sex with the new <UNK> with the porn voice a bunch of board games flash on the big screens and the whole the only way to win is not to play revelation is supposed to be the <UNK> moment except that those of us who saw the original you know those who would want to see this in the first place have already been there and done that a recycled ending for a movie made from last <UNK> <UNK> br br the new movie was directed by a guy who's done <UNK> and written by guys who do b movies the original was directed by a guy who's been keeping himself busy with heroes so you see the quality difference there there was talk of a real remake but i hope they don't destroy this classic all over again i swear if i have to i'll visit every gambling web site until i find the one that's run by a psychotic government computer the saving grace is that i was able to stream this on netflix so at least the only energy i <UNK> watching this disaster was for breathing <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> now what's wrong with the actors that took part in that crap michael <UNK> should stick to the star <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> does anyone remember him in miami vice liked him there well whatever what can one expect from a movie with one of the <UNK> from <UNK> in the lead nothing and that's what we get none of the characters is even likable the special effects are hilarious but not funny the story is a very bad joke there is no logic whatsoever for what's happening i got the feeling that the film makers were trying some kind of attack of the killer tomatoes kind of thing especially in the scene where all the important people were discussing national security in some kind of a closet br br if you happen to see it on tv switch channels your tv set will be ever thankful
<START> this is probably one of the worst french movies i have seen so far among more than 100 french movies i have ever seen terrible screenplay and very <UNK> <UNK> acting causes the directing <UNK> with all that it doesn't matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the story br br one of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do not attract people as an audience i don't care what happens to them br br it amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes man i love almost all the awarded movies in cannes but not this one a major disappointment for me
<START> as a long time fan of peter <UNK> greatest creation i watched this film on dvd with no great hopes of enjoyment indeed i expected to be reaching in disgust for the remote control within fifteen minutes but instead i thoroughly enjoyed this production and i especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and director succeeded in telling the modesty blaise back story they managed to avoid the trap of making a bad film version of the books we are all so familiar with choosing instead to concentrate on a period in <UNK> life only <UNK> to in the novels br br as for the production values and i am no student of cinematography yes the film was filmed on a tight financial and time budget and maybe that shows but does it spoil the viewer's enjoyment in this case i think not instead we are introduced to one of the world's greatest literary <UNK> and given a taste of her <UNK> br br in regard to the casting because we in unfamiliar territory the only people who really matter are modesty and perhaps professor <UNK> for me they were totally credible alexandra <UNK> described by some as wooden and too thin to be an action heroine brought to the screen <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> her technique when martial arts were needed but most importantly <UNK> the integrity which is at the core of the modesty blaise <UNK> br br ok so we all know this film was produced to stake <UNK> claim to the modesty blaise character it was made quickly and cheaply but i for one cannot wait to see the next production in this series by these producers as long as they keep to the core values and <UNK> of the original stories
<START> this is my third comment here attempting to connect two legendary movie comedy teams laurel hardy and <UNK> <UNK> the connection here is the year 1940 that's the date that the former had their last movie from their longtime home studio of hal roach i'll mention the significance of the latter later on besides being the last time stan and ollie worked at the lot of fun it's also the final time they would appear with such familiar supporting players like charlie hall and james <UNK> who appeared in most of their films it's also the last time art lloyd would serve as their cameraman and marvin <UNK> who composed their theme song which would be known as the <UNK> song dance of the <UNK> their score and it would be the very last time stan laurel would be allowed to exercise complete creative control over what goes on film if there is a more gag laden structure than usual in this l h film it's nice to know most of those gags are indeed funny that includes most of the sound and visual effects the latter provided by longtime roach <UNK> roy <UNK> in this one ollie has <UNK> from working at a <UNK> horn factory so dr <UNK> <UNK> going out to sea for his rest ollie doesn't like to go <UNK> so stan suggests they just rent one that's <UNK> so they wouldn't have to go anywhere after they find one they like we find out that convict nick <UNK> richard <UNK> has just escaped i'll stop there and say this was as good a finale for l <UNK> longtime home as one could hope for it's hilarious mostly from beginning to end and knowing this would be their last for the man partly responsible for their <UNK> is indeed poignant when one thinks of it oh and i have a couple more lasts to mention it's the final film appearance of both harry bernard who plays a harbor <UNK> after years of <UNK> stan and ollie as a policeman and that of ben <UNK> the cross eyed comic who was born in new orleans which is a couple of hours away from my current hometown of <UNK> <UNK> whose second l h appearance this was having previously married the boys in our wife the latter performer especially has a genuine comic moment all right i mentioned 1940 being the year stan and ollie had their last movie released from hal roach studios it was also the first year that a comedy team both born in the state of new jersey would make their first picture at what would be their home studio universal the director of that movie would be the same one that guided l h in the flying <UNK> the previous year his name was a edward sutherland p s it was during this filming that script <UNK> virginia lucille jones had an accident involving a rolled up carpet that incident caused oliver babe hardy to send her <UNK> to her hospital room they fell in love and married on march 7 1940 it lasted until <UNK> death in 1957
<START> let me start by saying how much i love the tv series despite the tragic nature of a middle aged man seemingly unable to pursue his dreams because of his overbearing manipulative father it was incredibly light hearted and fun to watch in practice in my opinion it is without doubt one of the greatest british sitcoms of all time the tv series has my 10 out of 10 rating without <UNK> br br this movie spin off on the other hand is a true tragedy in every sense of the word hardly any of the essence of the tv show is transferred successfully onto film this movie has a very dreary depressing tone that almost moved me to tears on several occasions seeing harold being beaten up in a pub and not in a comical way is not my idea of comedy but is most definitely one reason why fans of the tv series will not like this movie the movie was painfully unfunny except for the scene where albert <UNK> in the sink and is seen by a <UNK> br br the romance between harold and <UNK> is completely out of tone and it makes me wonder whether the producers of this movie ever bothered to watch the tv series in the tv series harold always went after respectable girls not <UNK> br br <UNK> reactions to the remarks made against him by <UNK> girlfriends were absolutely priceless in the tv series in the movie albert says virtually nothing when such an opportunity rises br br most movie spin offs of british sitcoms tend to be quite dull with the notable exception of the on the <UNK> films which in some respects were actually better than the tv series itself but <UNK> and son has to rank right at the very bottom of the pile even below george and mildred br br my advice skip this one and see the second spin off <UNK> and son ride again instead it has a much lighter tone is more faithful to the tv series and is actually very funny
<START> okay let me start off by saying that nothing in this will come as a surprise to anyone who's read the other comments that being said my g d this movie <UNK> i mean wow i didn't know it was possible to throw as much money as they obviously did at something and still come out worse than any roger corman movie corman was probably pitched this movie at some point but <UNK> due to the poor quality of the script the only reason this movie got made in the first place is that someone said <UNK> zombies are popular video games are popular what game can we get a hold of that has zombies in it resident evil no someone else got there first silent hill no too silent people will never sit in a dark room just to be scared silly hey didn't <UNK> have a game where people ran around shooting zombies they're out of the platform <UNK> we could get that for <UNK> ' br br basically they tried their best to make a movie that felt like the video game even down to shooting the combat as if the characters were actually playing the game br br the first and major problem is that the original game was horrid i mean br br bad movie <UNK> made into a worse game in two weeks and then <UNK> d out and bought by morons and their parents for christmas horrid the graphics were boring the monsters were boring the levels were boring the <UNK> was boring the case was boring in other words this was a boring game and that was the <UNK> version the home version was even worse with the home version you didn't even get the shotgun to hold in your hand while you were being bored silly by this pointless game but i <UNK> br br the second problem is that they went so far as to actually <UNK> scenes from actual <UNK> during the fight scenes huh didn't the editor have enough confidence in the effects to indicate that there was an actual fight going on not to mention that every fight was shot from the perspective of a video game which may explain the tedious use of matrix style effects the problem with this is that the game was a first person <UNK> the player proceeds from the <UNK> of the character maybe that's why they put in the game graphics to let you know that they were <UNK> to the game right whatever br br anyway the only thing that made this entire experience remotely enjoyable was the fact that everyone in the theatre was making fun of the movie out loud so my sudden fits of hysterical laughter and general <UNK> were taken as <UNK> and didn't get me kicked out br br to sum up don't go see this movie don't even <UNK> to rent it when it comes out on video in a couple of week run just run
<START> film is designed to affect the audience and this film left me speechless <UNK> photographed and well acted with dialog that approaches poetry the film involves lust hate murder rape <UNK> and deception it weaves an intense web that left me unable to take my eyes off the screen until the closing credits the story is sweeping it takes the audience from the atrocities of the spanish civil war to the human <UNK> left behind roger <UNK> and bruno <UNK> are two young actors who command the screen supporting players are excellently cast and lend a real sense of authenticity sets lighting scenery and cinematography are wonderful i absolutely love the photography
<START> if you have trouble <UNK> disbelief then this isn't for you consider a woman already in late middle age finds a <UNK> baby in a <UNK> <UNK> and raises it as her own think about it she makes no attempt to locate the mother who may well be a confused teenager in need of medical treatment and seemingly no one from the italian equivalent of social services makes any attempt to put the baby into <UNK> no social services now i know it's a fantasy before you know it young <UNK> is ten or so and his <UNK> mother dies leaving him to the <UNK> from which he emerges a happy man who loves everybody in nothing flat he has not only given his <UNK> to the man who stole it from him but <UNK> the local homeless into <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> residents and for an <UNK> he leads them in a fight against capitalism in the shape of the businessman who buys the land on which the <UNK> stands when oil is discovered there this wants some <UNK> without the subsequent <UNK> beginning with <UNK> dead mother the old lady who raised him rather than his <UNK> one appearing to him and <UNK> him a <UNK> which <UNK> as a magic <UNK> allowing him to grant modest wishes and a finale in which the <UNK> fly away to a better place located presumably somewhere over the <UNK> br br on the other hand the film is up to here with charm and is easy to surrender to on balance a small masterpiece
<START> i'd like to start off by saying that i am not an anime fan with a few notable exceptions and i generally have a low opinion of so called <UNK> as they are so in love with their particular brand of <UNK> that they label every movie starring <UNK> haired big eyed characters as a work of art without even considering other more vital factors such as the plot and no anime movie better represents this division between <UNK> and people with actual taste than this elegant piece of trash fatal fury the motion picture br br as seen through the <UNK> witless eyes of an <UNK> there's little to find fault with in fatal fury there's plenty of quirky japanese y humor one on one <UNK> some dramatic moments and everything is beautifully drawn but everyone else will be turned off by the cliched predictable plot with cliched predictable characters culminating in a cliched predictable ending the love scenes are hilariously overblown the scene in which <UNK> <UNK> terry is obviously intended to be a tender moment but it's virtually impossible to not be thrown into <UNK> of <UNK> laughter by the sheer <UNK> of it and of course fatal fury is not without the obligatory cartoon t a this is <UNK> <UNK> by the huge <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and since fatal fury is based off the video game series of the same name oh boy we're treated to numerous pointless cameo appearances by popular characters with little or no relevance to the plot whatsoever they go through all the trouble of introducing kim early on only for him to disappear from the movie totally after that point this mess of a movie reaches its climax with the unintentionally <UNK> final battle in which all the main characters engage the all powerful main villain in one on one combat in turn that's some thing that's always amused me even when battles in <UNK> aren't taking place in a <UNK> they always happen as if they were regardless of the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever br br <UNK> always rave about how anime movies should be treated as movies as opposed to merely cartoons and a disturbing portion of those same people love fatal fury so would fatal fury have been good if it wasn't an anime the answer is an <UNK> no all of this movie's charm what little of it there is <UNK> in the actual drawings had fatal fury not been an anime it would have been worthy of an episode of mystery science theater 3000 if the show was still on the air that's the key this is nothing more than a laughably bad b movie in the <UNK> of an anime epic if you're a fan of movies so bad that they're actually entertaining consider renting fatal fury or catch it on the sci fi channel as it is definitely one of those if you're an <UNK> please wake up and realize that a good 90 of the stuff you're watching is garbage as for everyone else buy a <UNK> and fatal fury mark of the wolves but don't even consider seeing this movie
<START> as far as the muppet line goes however this is not the best nor the second best this was <UNK> towards the <UNK> but has some dark and emotionally <UNK> adult moments to which parents may not wish to expose their children one of which showcases miss <UNK> going <UNK> in a jealous rage which lasts basically throughout the duration of this work br br beyond that however the story is <UNK> and highly entertaining one scene in which joan rivers and miss <UNK> go <UNK> in a department store is simply hilarious and there are other parts of this work which contain the same level of <UNK> and fun br br i like this very much and enjoy it still today br br it rates a 7 6 10 from br br the fiend
<START> i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good right how wrong i was br br i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of <UNK> he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey a director writer of <UNK> making his feature debut blah well the director writer of edison must have some <UNK> pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man because i cannot see how he along with the other actors in the film would ever agree to be in this disaster br br this movie is absolutely appalling it's a mixture of every cop hard boiled cliché ever there is nothing new with edison the acting was bad and the direction was even worse it looked like that aforementioned episode of <UNK> this was the best casted direct to video movie i've ever seen br br some examples of just bad silly moments in edison morgan freeman dancing around his apartment for no reason to rock and roll music justin timberlake getting creative criticism from his belle while his apartment is surrounded by <UNK> <UNK> driving a vintage <UNK> 3 guys being shot in the head br br this movie is the opposite of good br br stay away from edison
<START> for the attention of chuck davis and <UNK> i saw phantom lady many years ago when i was not yet a jazz buff there is an <UNK> going until end of june in <UNK> brand new <UNK> du <UNK> <UNK> named le <UNK> du jazz not to be missed with as a special entertainment nine <UNK> from jazz movies including phantom <UNK> famous drums sequence i've seen gene <UNK> and elisha cook jr in almost all their film appearances and i can confirm the following 1 elisha cook jr was dubbed in the movie that was some progress since in most of his other appearances he was killed mainly in howard <UNK> the big sleep 2 <UNK> probably dubbed cook in <UNK> i could recognize his style since he had already <UNK> from the tom tom used and abused at the beginning of his career namely in <UNK> hollywood <UNK> sing sing sing sequence and eventually got everything that was possible from what we call in french la <UNK> claire 3 the sequence from <UNK> at least as shown in the museum is not <UNK> harry <UNK> paris france
<START> even though the shining is over a quarter of a century old i challenge anyone to not get freaked out by jack <UNK> descent into madness this is a rare example of something so unique that no one has been able to rip it off instead it has been <UNK> time and again in pop culture the twins the elevator of blood <UNK> the crazy nonsense writing this should be seen if for nothing else to understand all the <UNK> to it in daily life the film is simultaneously scary suspenseful beautiful and psychologically intriguing it has the classic mystery of hitchcock and the terror of a modern thriller and it has what horror movies usually lack a great script
<START> this is the best piece of film ever created its a master piece that brought a tear to my eye ill never forget my experience watching it i don't understand why people don't think as i do the dinosaur turns in a performance reminiscent of de niro in raging bull pacino in scarface and <UNK> in gladiator combined this should be released on dvd in <UNK> format so i can fully enjoy it like it was meant to be enjoyed when they produced and filmed it <UNK> goldberg truly turns in the performance of a lifetime as a tough gritty cop who is against her will teamed with a hot shot dinosaur as her partner then the hi <UNK> ensues to say the least by the way i'm saying the complete opposite of what is true this movie is utter garbage
<START> as if the film were not of value in itself this is an excellent way to get an <UNK> of the novel as a <UNK> to reading it in the summer of 1968 i saw the film in nyc that fall in graduate school i read the book for the first time some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the <UNK> detailed film and for better or worse and i've now read and taught the novel for over three decades milo <UNK> is still leopold bloom
<START> this was the funniest piece of film tape i have ever witnessed bar none i laughed myself sick the first three times i watched it i recommend it to everyone with the warning that if they can't handle the f <UNK> to stay far away at his best when telling stories from a kids point of view
<START> absolutely awful movie utter waste of time br br background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech well if you really listen closely whatever they speak is actually <UNK> br br camera work is bad editing is not present background score gives a headache action is shoddy dialogs are <UNK> acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler now she looks like a <UNK> wrestler hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace br br after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure br br please if you want to torture yourself go ahead watch this
<START> this is a wonderful film first impressions of cynicism and <UNK> are soon <UNK> by a fun loving display of how men and women's <UNK> motivations <UNK> <UNK> la difference br br you can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses human beings are a bit rubbish really but we have big hearts and we try our best despite temptation it's not our fault when sometimes temptation can't be <UNK> that's just who we are br br there is a consistent <UNK> from start to finish crisp photography and sharp composition very pleasant viewing when you add provocative content well suited music and laugh out loud scripting br br watch out for the very young lone wise voice brilliant wisdom from innocence <UNK> comedy from the human condition
<START> read <UNK> review again he perfectly described my own feeling for this film so more <UNK> than i ever could i'm only writing here to further encourage you to look for and see it br br i saw it many years ago on tv the <UNK> i think it is such a unique film i hesitate to make comparisons it was filmed in northern mexico somewhere in the relentless <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> san luis <UNK> this isn't the <UNK> like <UNK> mexico of the john wayne films but a truly stark and wild place i have to find the novel now to check on the original location of the story like the location this movie is strange and wild and wonderful and weird and absolutely not for everyone it is the kind of production that almost <UNK> me to study film br br i hadn't actually forgotten this movie it is <UNK> yet over the years i had forgotten of its existence i know nobody who has seen it had never read of it nor seen any reference to it <UNK> is such an unusual name i'd even forgotten the title well i'll be looking to buy a copy now br br i have since the above <UNK> become a huge fan of gabriel garcia <UNK> and so regret not having read him before br br relative to <UNK> comment below the movie was filmed in mexico but the author is <UNK> and was not commenting on mexico or mexican history in any way although <UNK> now lives in mexico for political reasons this story is universal br br i am still trying desperately to find a copy of this film for my library liked the movie you have to read the story and then everything else garcia <UNK> wrote and by the way the original location in the story was <UNK>
<START> i first saw the live musical at the denver center for the performing arts and it was absolutely mind blowing stunning and had such fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that i liked it much more than most musicals that i have seen on the stage the interesting thing is that you never got to see <UNK> face he was always in the dark but his presence was powerful and guided the direction of entire production <UNK> i heard they were making a movie from it i waited with <UNK> breath but when i watched the movie version i was so <UNK> out disappointed that i felt i was cheated the movie lacks the captivating mood set in the live production and it never allows you to be completely in close touch with every character personally i would like to see the live version again and if that should ever be <UNK> i would <UNK> recommend that you go out of your way to see it it will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy
<START> wow it's been years since i last saw this movie watching it in 2008 is certainly different than watching it in 1986 initially i <UNK> think i would make it through the movie hunt stevenson michael keaton was so obnoxious arrogant and <UNK> that i found it hard to watch him he <UNK> every negative stereotype of americans if that wasn't bad enough once the small american town's finest workers were shown the image only got worse on the opposite spectrum the japanese were presented as <UNK> robotic <UNK> the movie wasn't even all that funny i only hung in there because of the nostalgic value of it and i'm glad i continued the watch br br just like boxing judges are <UNK> by how you finish the round this movie went from about a three up to the seven i rated it because of the ending the end was excellent you always want a <UNK> ending and this was just that it was great that the town got to keep there jobs and keep the factory but what was most special was the marriage between the japanese customs and values and the american customs and values it was a mediocre movie that ended on a high note
<START> the ruth <UNK> judd gray murder in <UNK> inspired <UNK> <UNK> to write a broadway play called <UNK> more <UNK> it inspired james m cain to write two short novels which anyone who has actually reached the point where they are reading this review would be familiar with double <UNK> and the <UNK> always rings twice both became film noir classics of the 1940's double <UNK> being arguably the most perfect noir ever made some of the real life elements of the <UNK> gray story were captured by cain the old age and indifference of albert gray <UNK> high sex drive ruth and <UNK> passionate affair and <UNK> in the murder and that famous double <UNK> insurance <UNK> missing elements included the fact that the actual setting was a very urban manhattan albert <UNK> being a respected newspaper editor the numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase br br <UNK> double <UNK> was filmed perfectly by billy wilder let's ignore <UNK> ridiculous wig as one of those interesting <UNK> of film <UNK> the <UNK> always rings twice however was filmed <UNK> and ossessione an italian version and <UNK> <UNK> first film was the first of three versions before commenting on it i'll recommend the <UNK> turner john garfield version of 1946 in its entirety and five minutes of the 1981 jack nicholson jessica lange version for the great sex scene on the <UNK> table br br ossessione is not as <UNK> as the <UNK> always rings twice it has a strong neo <UNK> look which makes it a great movie but a lot of the essential noir elements are missing it does not have low key lighting and unconventional camera angles the dialog is not hard boiled and instead the film concentrates more on characterization this is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization its also a lot more sexual than the <UNK> turner version we have a very obvious <UNK> relationship and giovanna is very obviously a <UNK> a new character is introduced into the story la <UNK> with very obvious homosexual overtones there is also a small but very well played role for a dancer who <UNK> as a prostitute br br this is a far greater study of the working class than of crime the audience really gets the feeling of poverty and <UNK> the drifter is a complete tramp the wife is no <UNK> turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage her husband is an obscene <UNK> <UNK> rude and arrogant i think the casting was brilliant for this film my only <UNK> is with the overlong running time everything is drawn out too long and it would have been more effective if it had been more <UNK> nevertheless fans of noir and realism will definitely like ossessione as i did
<START> somewhere inside this movie is a half hour episode from the twilight zone trying to get out whereas cube was taut well made claustrophobic and mind engaging i'm afraid cypher is a <UNK> tedious rehash of several well worn themes which just don't add up to much especially if you have seen almost any other half way decent sci fi film before br br cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending none of the characters spark off each other and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy it is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of cube it's not a bad movie but it is most definitely not a good one br br when you've watched the grass grow and paint dry and are bored of your stick insects then by all means watch this film but the other activities will probably prove more stimulating
<START> this could be looked at in many different ways this movie sucks its good or its just plain weird the third one probably explains this movie best it has strange themes and just has a strange plot so who else but christopher walken would play in this no matter how bad average or even how good it might be br br the acting was what you would expect especially out of ben stiller jack black i have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad christopher walken is always off the wall he is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is comedy wise it is somewhat funny this of course meaning that it does have its moments though very few but can get a little over top here and there which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughs but of course not in a good way br br the directing was average as well barry <UNK> is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job here this movie seemed that it had a lot more potential and he did not do much to reach it just very average and did not seem like a lot of effort was put into making this film br br the writing is the key to a good comedy obviously that means the writing here failed at best it is below average considering it does have its moments it was not too horrible that is never a good thing to say about a movie though br br if not for christopher walken and it stupid ridiculous ending i would have given it a lower rating he is always quite a character in his movies <UNK> this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really don't go anywhere not completely horrible but i would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie
<START> natural born killers 1994 br br cinema cut r br br director's cut <UNK> 17 br br it's an unusual oliver stone picture but when i read he was on drugs during the filming i needed no further explanation <UNK> born <UNK> is a <UNK> mad all out film making that we do not get very often strange psychotic artistic pictures br br <UNK> born <UNK> is basically the story of how two mass killers were <UNK> and <UNK> by the media there is a great scene where an <UNK> questions some teenagers about mickey and <UNK> and the teenager says <UNK> is wrong but if i was a mass murderer i'd be mickey and <UNK> mickey describes this with a situation of <UNK> the monster and dr <UNK> dr frankenstein is the media who has turned them into these monstrous killers br br most oliver stone films examine the flaws of the america the country that the director loves and <UNK> i guess <UNK> born <UNK> is about the effect of mass media technology and how obsessive as a nation americans are and most of the world over things such as mass killers and bizarre situations br br the killers played by woody <UNK> mickey and juliette lewis <UNK> are executed astonishingly by two excellent actors who step into the lives of two interestingly brutal killers mickey and <UNK> believe that some people are worthy of killing perhaps in the cruel theory of social <UNK> survival of the <UNK> mickey says in his interview in prison that other species commit murder we as humans <UNK> other species and exploit the environment the script is interesting but it is questionable how much this film amounts to in the sense of making us think about society and human behaviour rather than the intensity of a 2 hour bloodbath that we have seen br br the last hour of the film takes place in a maximum security prison we see the harsh realities of prison life the attitudes of the warden etc <UNK> of <UNK> maybe stone is questioning the future the path that society is leading to br br two other interesting characters first a reporter who runs a show about <UNK> <UNK> and is obsessed with <UNK> ratings that he goes to any length to capture the story of mickey and <UNK> the other is police officer <UNK> an insane perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with <UNK> he also has some weird obsession with mass killers since his mother was killed during the massacre at <UNK> texas by charles <UNK> br br the cinematography is superb different colours shadows styles create a feeling of <UNK> the green colour most evident of all is green to resemble the sickness of the killers in the <UNK> when they are looking for <UNK> <UNK> br br the camera work is insane shaky <UNK> it takes some determination to get use to it and accept it highly <UNK> psychedelic and unusual br br <UNK> born <UNK> does not <UNK> the existence of insane murderers it questions it and how we as the public may fuel this <UNK> br br although the above review sound quite positive i did dislike the film quentin tarantino who originally wrote the script for the film was not pleased with the altered screenplay and he asked for his name to be removed i can see why while mildly interesting at times natural born killers is a mess of a picture br br 4 10
<START> <UNK> romantic comedy with <UNK> subplots that <UNK> beautifully and actors who <UNK> lines off each other with precise comic timing a feat that is beautiful to behold when <UNK> <UNK> fiancé asks her to help him make peace with his estranged moody younger brother no one could dream the consequences which follow operatic symbolism catholic church <UNK> love bites and falling snow moonstruck is timeless and smooth it takes about 15 minutes for the <UNK> rhythm to kick in there's an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery that's a little rough and a following scene with <UNK> and the elderly man at the gate that seems <UNK> but the <UNK> of the plot is <UNK> with <UNK> skill and the movie's <UNK> tone and <UNK> spirit are both <UNK> 1 2 from
<START> really and incredible film that though isn't very popular extremely touching and almost life <UNK> was for me at least br br definitely worth seeing and buying added to my favorite movie list it's number one now br br this is a very touching movie that all people should see br br the man in the moon we'll it's just incredible it's now my favorite movie and i only saw it today and i'd recommend it to anyone above 15 as long as you're somewhat mature if you don't really try to feel the characters emotions then you'll never get the true meaning and value of this movie but it really is incredible just watch it because it'll alter the way some people look at life worth seeing 5 5
<START> this is an abysmal piece of story telling it is about an hour into the movie before we have much idea of what it is supposed to be about the characters often <UNK> <UNK> actions frequently seem to have no relation to each other nobody seems to be concerned about who actually murdered the girl a pair of spooky kids go swimming in waters that seem threatening but nothing happens the <UNK> gets <UNK> in the face by one of his buddies for no apparent reason to continue would be as boring as the movie itself the only half entertaining element is the landscape photography but anyone could point a camera at the australian <UNK> a get memorable shots overall dreary incoherent pretentious and downright annoying for wasting so much of the viewer's time
<START> i've long heard that to get their start in <UNK> films many behind the camera types work on porno films br br the people who produced and directed this monstrosity stayed too long br br poorly paced staged and written it uses a lot of perfectly good talent <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> badly br br much sexual activity is <UNK> implied here by the <UNK> popping host to the alien creature but it never crosses the line br br you'll still want to shower afterwards though
<START> what i like about you is one of those series you need to see but aren't sure you would see the beginning is cool and its sucks you into the series just for fun the second part i season 2 3 which are more stale they come and go in what you want what happens with many series is that they don't end with something special because the second part of the series always goes down into the drain this one also somewhat did the third part is the one to spoil and ruin the whole series usually but it doesn't this ending is perfect for the series it fits perfect actually i was pretty angry about all these guys in <UNK> life actually i wanted to end with jeff in the end but later on it changed they chose to take <UNK> into the series after almost 3 seasons without him and that was the biggest surprise and also what made the series go on top br br see it many times the series is actually very cool just don't expect the second part to be that good it isn't but the third part does what was needed and made the series to one that was worth the whole thing i am happy to say i was glad and happy about the series and now i will go over to see two guys a girl and a pizza place when i have seen the whole series i will be back
<START> first of all <UNK> <UNK> the film is only fairly loosely based on the robert louis stevenson story of the same name but for once this is not a criticism the original novel was a work in progress unfinished at the author's death and in <UNK> adapting it and giving it an ending the film makers have brought to life some endearing characters who although different from <UNK> originals would i am sure have <UNK> and amused him br br it is <UNK> <UNK> jacques de <UNK> de saint <UNK> is a <UNK> aristocrat <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> now serving as a <UNK> in <UNK> army we meet him going out for the evening claiming that since a <UNK> who is not dead by 30 is a <UNK> he at <UNK> is now on borrowed time certainly as he faces a string of challenges to <UNK> our dashing hero seems in danger but a surreal prank on his colonel provides him a way out of the <UNK> and into the bed of a beautiful <UNK> singer unfortunately it also results in losing his <UNK> further <UNK> result in him being taken prisoner by the british and sent to a <UNK> camp in a scottish castle br br while <UNK> toys and boxes jacques catches the attention of <UNK> the young niece of miss susan <UNK> a well <UNK> woman of the world who lives at <UNK> <UNK> they fall in love and most of the story concerns <UNK> helping jacques to escape and to find his <UNK> grandfather the old <UNK> of course there is a problem <UNK> older brother <UNK> a <UNK> alcoholic is perhaps understandably far from pleased when grandfather <UNK> him in front of the whole household the very instant that jacques has appeared cue <UNK> there is also an entertaining subplot of the romance between the awkward <UNK> but good hearted major <UNK> <UNK> and aunt susan who has <UNK> through most of the <UNK> empire and been a prisoner of the <UNK> br br even allowing for a natural prejudice in favour of any film in which the <UNK> share my <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is magic it combines <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a balloon flight comedy and romantic adventure i would recommend it to anyone who loves 'the kind of film they don't make <UNK> fairbanks colman flynn co the acting is splendid anna <UNK> makes <UNK> a spirited and appealing heroine and jean marc <UNK> is delightful as jacques a genuinely lovable hero miranda richardson and richard e grant are already great favourites of mine and have great fun as susan and <UNK> whose relationship runs as a comic <UNK> to that of the leads as the <UNK> scheming but ultimately tragic <UNK> jason <UNK> shows as he did more recently in 'the <UNK> that he has the classic <UNK> style besides the dashing good looks please please will someone cast him as a hero in the genre br br my main <UNK> with the film concern settings and costumes in the book the castle in which jacques is a prisoner is clearly <UNK> but the film shot in ireland germany and france has <UNK> the setting making the <UNK> of place names such as <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> decidedly <UNK> the costumes too are a real <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> through to the period in which it is set while this would not be implausible with more down market characters making do it seems odd for well to do ladies such as the <UNK> to be wearing <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> clearly the <UNK> decision was <UNK> these earlier styles are visually far more appealing and elegant than <UNK> fashions and they work in the <UNK> world of the film as a whole <UNK> <UNK> is 90 minutes of pure delight
<START> for my first taste of shakespeare on stage i cannot believe what these people did to a perfectly good play br br let's start off with the good bit shall we br br alan <UNK> is alright although some of his dialog could have been delivered with more feeling the rest of the actors needed to pull it together br br romeo romeo <UNK> art <UNK> not dead yet romeo the actor while not only completely wooden and deadpan could not read his lines with any gusto at all he was completely out of focus had difficulty even looking juliet in the face and absolutely no grace with the lines that he was given whoever cast him deserves to be <UNK> juliet is almost passable but she gives no depth to her character and seems to be completely out of touch with the play <UNK> was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialog <UNK> was <UNK> and mercilessly choppy with his lines br br i was forced to endure this half baked production of romeo and juliet the acting was stilted and the costumes were nothing short of distracting i have seen <UNK> puppet shows with more effort put into them i only wish that i could give this movie a rating of zero
<START> i can find very little thats good to say about this film i am sure the idea and script looked good on paper but the filmography and acting i am afraid is not the standards i would expect from some very talented people i would doubt that this features highly in their <UNK> filmography michael caine appeared wooden at times in his role as the doctor and at no time no did i actually believe in his character the plot was unbelievable especially with regard to the victims son some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films that at times i wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller the lighting at times was dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big named stars wondering why i bothered to watch it at all
<START> this was one of the all time best episodes officer sean cooper was murdered in his <UNK> car back in <UNK> a dying convict in the state <UNK> reveals that he stole a block of heroin from the car after the shooting his case is <UNK> with the <UNK> that he was <UNK> as a policeman br br further investigation into him as a police officer and a human being reveals a war veteran involved in a forbidden love this type of love was considered shameful and something to at least keep hidden at that time br br while this isn't the type of love i personally support he was still a policeman and a human being and shouldn't have been killed for it the sound track was excellent keeps me watching the <UNK> and the <UNK> use of black and white mixed with color to emphasize one object or give a particular feeling to a scene was especially appealing i shall be watching this one in repeat
<START> it is so <UNK> to see one great piece of art converted into another without <UNK> or <UNK> i had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be <UNK> as a film worth seeing if you loved <UNK> book you would be understandably afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art film project than for actually bringing the story's deeper meaning to the screen there are a couple examples of this with the master and <UNK> as complex and far fetched as the story is the movie leaves out nothing it is as if the filmmaker read <UNK> work the same way an <UNK> conductor reads a score with not a note missed why can't we find such talent here in the u s so now my favorite book and movie have the same title
<START> i just came back from a pre release viewing of this excellent sci fi film <UNK> it's style is <UNK> unique and very well made it is filmed with actual actors but transformed into a black and white comic strip style you have never seen before it goes one step further than sin city and it does it well it's a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures the story and mood remind of blade runner and if you liked that one you will surely like this one too the storyline is intelligent never boring and has some nice little twists this film is a must see for any <UNK> except perhaps those who absolutely don't like sci fi or b w
<START> this movie is exciting daring and the music is very good the movie <UNK> was meant to <UNK> with the album bad 1987 i have bad it is excellent the movie begins with michael jackson performing man in the mirror on stage then it shows a history of michael from his early days in the jackson 5 right up to the bad era oh and <UNK> is good too <UNK> is a music video parody of the music video for bad the single it then shows the speed demon video the song and the video are very very good indeed same for leave me alone which appears after then it shows the movie <UNK> after a few minutes he plays smooth criminal in a club called club 30s like it when he does the lean anyway nice to see you bye bye
<START> perhaps the most personal of david lynch's works is his most accessible this time rather than the enigmatic <UNK> <UNK> that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares lynch provides a <UNK> fragile <UNK> on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds <UNK> in both the simple true story of an <UNK> farmer richard farnsworth who rides a lawn <UNK> to <UNK> to visit his estranged stricken brother there are still plenty of the unique and original visual <UNK> some rather striking <UNK> shots of the <UNK> filmed by veteran cinematographer freddy francis to make it an <UNK> lynch effort and characterizations that are some of his most unforgettable farnsworth is excellent in a stoic yet <UNK> way allowing the stories he hears on his journey to become a part of his life and sissy <UNK> turns in some of her finest work in a smaller role as his mentally challenged yet <UNK> daughter whose painful secret is revealed in a poignant way through a gentle turn in the sensitive script by john roach and mary <UNK> but the rest of the small cast to a person delivers <UNK> performances one of the most notable being barbara robertson whose accidental killing of a deer is both <UNK> and sad at the same time but that's vintage lynch with his ability to engage and <UNK> you at his best to those unfamiliar with lynch or know him only by his violent disturbing reputation this is an excellent place to begin for those who know his work this is one of the finest in his <UNK>
<START> one has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a br br script existed that made any sense was the rough cut 3 hours br br long and was it <UNK> into the incoherent mess that survives br br why would anyone <UNK> this mess i will say that tom br br <UNK> is a good looking young man and he does what he can br br with the dialogue and dramatic situations he is given but br br characters come and go for no apparent reason continuity is br br non existent and the acting cinematography and direction are to br br put it <UNK> amateurish not one sleeps is an unfortunate br br choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone br br actually attempt to actually watch this film
<START> something very strange happens when you talk about global warming science goes out the window and belief and <UNK> becomes the topic of discussion br br it's because of that fact that i give a failing mark to al <UNK> documentary br br instead of promoting intelligent discussion he kept the debate at the level of belief and <UNK> br br of course when you're trying to sell the world into spending <UNK> of dollars to stop global warming you may thing it's a problem to tell the scientific truth we don't know how much of the current warming was caused by humans maybe none of it maybe some of it or maybe it has over <UNK> the next ice age and we got really lucky not to have boiled the planet br br but the fact remains that we don't know br br so we're asked to believe in the <UNK> never mind that any scientist that <UNK> from the <UNK> is <UNK> never mind that scientific <UNK> is about <UNK> from the <UNK> einstein didn't believe in the <UNK> neither did <UNK> or <UNK> br br so why so much <UNK> placed on those very <UNK> who would advance the field by asking the tough questions if global warming is so <UNK> surely a few people testing that theory can't be so threatening br br what is going on here that's the movie i was hoping al gore would have made <UNK> he chose to shore up his support with the true <UNK> of the <UNK> br br sad really
<START> to bend it like beckham may not mean much to us americans who know very little about the other football soccer but to english sports fans it is equivalent to hit it like bonds or <UNK> it like jordan any young soccer player dreams of <UNK> a soccer ball around one player and into the net for a goal much like star player david beckham does much like the young indian girl jess <UNK> <UNK> does in the film bend it like beckham jess loves to play pick up soccer games the kind forbidden by her <UNK> mother however while playing one day a passing friend named jules <UNK> knightley sees her play and invites her to try out for a traveling all girls soccer team after satisfying the coach joe jonathan rhys meyers she makes the team something she knows her mother would not <UNK> of the movie is not about <UNK> parents but rather a girl doing what she wants to do even if that goes against culture not just the parents there is humor thrown throughout the movie especially when <UNK> mother thinks she's a lesbian the movie does resort to a bit of a cliché moment as the big soccer game is the same day as <UNK> sister's wedding but it does not come off a cheesy but rather fun and light the soccer action looks good so sports fans will enjoy it and a story about girls growing up in a boy's world the world of soccer will inspire some in the audience bend it like beckham is not just about soccer but rather a girl trying to find herself and please her parents at the same time something that proves to be rather difficult
<START> voodoo academy features an academy like no other one that houses only six male students in one bedroom these teenage guys are <UNK> in religion by a sinister young priest who enjoys <UNK> and <UNK> them simultaneously the sole <UNK> of this academy is a young and seductive <UNK> and she <UNK> her handsome charges on a short <UNK> so to speak br br sexual overtones abound and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies these young actors occasionally strip down to their designer underwear to sneak about the academy and their sexuality is the entire focus of the movie if you're not interested in the male form stay away br br <UNK> by weak and awkward dialogue this low budget exploitation piece just stumbles along with a few laughable special effects tossed in between the <UNK> the mood is claustrophobic with <UNK> long takes a handful of cheap sets and few costume changes these visual elements come interspersed with seemingly <UNK> sequences of banal dialogue intended as character and plot development it gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days
<START> dirty <UNK> is the more extreme british version of jackass in which the four boys <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> go to great <UNK> to hurt and <UNK> each other the reason this show is better than jackass is because most of the stunts are not planned which makes the reaction much more funny there are 3 series of the show the first follows them around and takes a long look at their lives <UNK> there's an episode on their love lives jobs etc the second series sends the boys to try out different <UNK> the third follows their european tour it seems that the boys get more and more daring as the show progresses through the series in my opinion the third series is the best but trust me when i say if you have a week stomach do not watch as you are lightly to see a fair amount of blood and <UNK> in every episode
<START> <UNK> 14 is not often looked as one of the great <UNK> but i would personally put it in my top 5 if not the top 3 it has so many great things and it truly <UNK> the birth of the attitude era which was <UNK> best era in my opinion <UNK> has the heart of a lion and him putting over austin like he did on his way out was pure class on his part it has one of the <UNK> crowds you will ever see and it has j r and the king at their <UNK> best br br matches br br 15  team battle royal loud pop for l o <UNK> return i'm not a fan of battle <UNK> and this is yet another average one very predictable even when you 1st see it it's obvious l o d would win looking at sunny for 8 or so minutes though definitely helps br br 2 5 br br <UNK> light <UNK> championship br br <UNK> <UNK> c vs <UNK> br br <UNK> gets a surprising pop with his entrance fast high flying and very exciting if these two had more time they would have surely <UNK> the roof off with their stuff <UNK> wins with the <UNK> driver br br 3 1 2 5 br br <UNK> european championship br br triple h c vs owen hart <UNK> here is <UNK> is <UNK> to slaughter nice pop for owen mixed reaction for <UNK> a really really underrated match that ranks among one of my favorites for <UNK> actually the two mixed together very well and owen can go with anybody <UNK> wins with <UNK> <UNK> br br 4 5 br br mixed tag match marc <UNK> <UNK> vs <UNK> <UNK> defining pop for <UNK> <UNK> of that time for woman <UNK> actually looks hot and the crowd is just eating her up constant <UNK> <UNK> and them <UNK> almost every time she gets in the ring not bad for a mixed tag match it had entertaining antics and passed the time well <UNK> team wins when <UNK> hits the <UNK> br br 2 1 2 5 br br <UNK> <UNK> championship ken <UNK> vs the rock c before i review the match i'd like to note the rock showed off his immense potential with his interview with jennifer flowers before his match nice pop for <UNK> big time heat for the rock too <UNK> short and i thought the ending was kinda stupid though <UNK> <UNK> antics were awesome to see and the crowd went nuts for it rock keeps the title when the <UNK> <UNK> the decision br br 2 5 br br <UNK> match for the <UNK> tag team championship br br <UNK> jack terry <UNK> vs the new age <UNK> the <UNK> are not as over as they were gonna be at this time crowd is actually somewhat dead for this but i thought it had some great hardcore bits with some sick looking <UNK> <UNK> and terry win the titles in the end br br 3 5 br br the undertaker vs kane big time <UNK> for the undertaker much better than there outing at <UNK> 20 and for a big man vs big man match this was really good it was a great all out <UNK> with the undertaker taking a sick looking <UNK> through the table wwe was smart by making kane looking strong even through defeat after 2 <UNK> kick <UNK> taker finally puts him away with a 3rd one br br 3 1 2 5 br br <UNK> championship br br special guest <UNK> mike <UNK> br br <UNK> c vs steve austin big heat for <UNK> crowd goes ape sh t for austin definitely one of the biggest pops i have heard mixed reaction for <UNK> this is truly a special match up one of the greatest <UNK> main events in history you can tell when j r is even out of breath <UNK> gives it his all in what was supposed to be his last match and austin has rarely been better the <UNK> and electricity from the crowd is amazing and it's as exciting as it gets austin wins with the <UNK> with <UNK> joining 3 16 by knocking out michaels <UNK> <UNK> victory is a wonder to behold with one of the <UNK> <UNK> you will ever see king said it right they were going nuts br br 5 5 br br bottom line <UNK> 14 is one of the greatest for real it has everything you want in a <UNK> and truly kick started the attitude era this is very special to me because it was the 1st <UNK> i ever saw back in 98 the austin era has begun br br 9 1 2 10
<START> i have seen this movie and the other one <UNK> is my name and i find that this one is worse then the first one i have no idea why they even made another movie it was stupid and pointless sorry to say that i have all of them i have sat through them number of times and it still drives me to turn it off 5 minutes into the movie i like <UNK> hill movies and i like bud spencer but this movie just drove me up the wall if it had a different story line or at least more of a plot and more comedy it might have been <UNK> and worth the 5 dollars i spent buying all the movies but you make mistakes so i would say save your money and don't bye this movie or any of the ones that go with it trust me on this one
<START> this is one of the best of the series <UNK> up there with resident evil 3 nemesis or <UNK> last escape the game has a very good storyline in which you play as claire <UNK> in the search for her brother chris <UNK> whom you probably know from the original resident evil it is as scary as the other resident evil and contains alot more <UNK> br br my rating out of stars rating based on comparison to other <UNK>
<START> verhoeven's movie was utter and complete garbage he's a disgusting hack of a director and should be ashamed by his own admission he read 2 chapters of the book got bored and decided to make the whole thing up from scratch br br <UNK> would have never supported that trash if he'd been alive to see it it basically steals the name <UNK> politics of the book which is a good portion of it and throws in some t a so the average idiot american <UNK> doesn't get bored br br this anime isn't perfect but it's at least mostly accurate as best i can tell
<START> if you are under the age of 6 or 7 then you're going to really enjoy this movie my youngest daughter is glued to the tv when she watches it as an adult i can't stand it i'm all up for sequels when they have a decent storyline but this is nowhere near up to standard please forgive me for <UNK> what is after all a kid's film but when you have to sit through it nearly every day when your kids who love it so much you'll understand why my daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her br br i've given this film 4 out of 10 purely for the fact that it keeps my youngest entertained
<START> as i have <UNK> my fascination with the academy awards has evolved from intense interest to casual amusement as in a few other comments that i have written the bizarre results of academy award voting are often difficult to explain the <UNK> of in cold blood in 1967 as one of the five best picture <UNK> is one of those inexplicable instances especially when one of the nominations that year went to the wretched and unwatchable dr <UNK> while only an <UNK> or <UNK> would tune in to that rex harrison disaster richard <UNK> powerful adaptation of truman <UNK> non fiction novel <UNK> its ability to capture the viewer's attention and leave him or her completely <UNK> by the final fade out while there is nothing particularly graphic or gruesome on screen the film is definitely adult material based on a <UNK> multiple murder in the 1950's and filmed in the actual locations where the murders took place in cold blood was filmed by master cinematographer conrad hall in stark black and white and his screen compositions demand to be seen in their correct widescreen aspect ratio together with <UNK> <UNK> unsettling score <UNK> work should have been credited above the title with <UNK> screenplay as the three <UNK> on which this intense classic is built the performances are fine as well scott wilson is all cold charm and robert blake intense <UNK> as the two killers there is an inside joke at one point when blake speaks of bogart and the treasure of the <UNK> <UNK> while the duo are driving to mexico as a child star blake sold the <UNK> ticket to bogart in that john huston film the film like the book is definitely <UNK> towards the killers and has an anti capital punishment <UNK> although the <UNK> of the murderers somewhat <UNK> that sentiment despite the difficult to watch final scenes some have criticized the film because it does focus on the criminals their backgrounds and lives while the clutter family which was literally murdered in cold blood in the middle of the night come across as one dimensional characters of little <UNK> this lack of balance comes from the book as capote spent much time with the two killers while they were on death row the clutter family was apparently not <UNK> to the same depth however whatever feelings one may have for or against capital punishment in cold blood will leave you <UNK> deep in <UNK> thoughts run a double bill with dead man walking and you may not speak for days
<START> <UNK> is a genuinely good film with great acting good narrative good presentation touching emotions etc br br it seems to me that the quality of films that bollywood is producing is quite <UNK> these days and this film is one evidence br br no bollywood movie that i can remember of made such an impact on me i was literally thinking about the movie for hours <UNK> at the various emotional situations that test the human in a human br br the film rests on the great acting of <UNK> <UNK> and also some from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> plays a girl in north india in the background of the <UNK> and all troubles seem sweet if compared with the problems she happens to face br br a must see film a technically superior bollywood product which i feel is comparable to the best movies coming out of other countries in the world
<START> kim patricia <UNK> george jake <UNK> and son miles <UNK> per sullivan are headed to the country for winter weekend relief from <UNK> <UNK> metropolis on the way they hit a buck and end up stuck in the snow a group of hunters who were tracking the buck come along rather than helping at least one of the hunters <UNK> john <UNK> is mad because the accident <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> george kim and miles are disturbed by <UNK> and even worse we quickly learn that <UNK> has learned where they're staying meanwhile miles is given a wendigo a kind of indian shape shifting spirit monster token by an indian whom only he has seen is <UNK> a psycho out to get our heroes are there <UNK> in the woods br br i can see where wendigo would have a number of problems appealing to viewers it is a fairly low budget film with technical limitations frequently showing through much of the film and maybe all of it is not really about the titular creature and perhaps the fatal blow for many people it has a very ambiguous ending with a number of questions left unanswered if you are <UNK> by such endings and you do not like films that have an aim of making you think about and discuss what everything meant do yourself a favor and avoid wendigo br br personally i like films like that i usually prefer some ambiguity the marketing of wendigo is <UNK> towards those who want a quick scary creature flick where they'd expect a grand battle with some supernatural monster who is defeated in the end and everything is tied up neatly except for an opening for wendigo 2 the monster returns but that's not what this film is wendigo is much more thoughtful and poetic than the surface of such a creature flick would suggest to most people heck writer director larry <UNK> even has a character george <UNK> robert frost the frost poem and <UNK> comment that frost can evoke complex imagery and atmosphere out of seemingly simple things is the key to the film br br one of the best things about the film is its complexity in a way there are four different films occurring at the same time a thread from each character in <UNK> thread he isn't exactly the <UNK> or most pleasant guy in the world and he has some <UNK> problems for him the film is a realistic horrific descent of his life going from bad to worse in <UNK> thread she's looking for <UNK> of her life and family she's a psychologist mostly denying the problems around her hoping that they'll go away and get better in <UNK> thread he's even more down on his luck than george and <UNK> arrival into his life <UNK> the final crack in his psychological armor and in <UNK> thread which is probably the most important of the film life is like a grand poem due to his youthful innocence and interpretation of the world but this is a horror story after all albeit one with a <UNK> of hope and the events in the film give <UNK> poetic interpretations a dark turn still when everything is said and done he seems to be the only one <UNK> his <UNK> due to the poetic <UNK> br br even though the film is low budget there are a lot of well executed higher budget ambitions <UNK> and director of photography terry <UNK> find some great shots in beautiful locations and created some interesting slide show like montages such as the cards or the indian wendigo images from the book there are also interesting more traditional montages such as <UNK> nightmare wendigo is better shot and edited than many big budget films br br other technical aspects are good for the budget the wendigo appearance at the end worked for me and was appropriately ambiguous the lighting was usually good there were a few times that dark scenes weren't as clear as they could have been but it seemed to be more of a problem with the film stock it could have been digital instead or transfer i thought the performances were good and far more realistic if you value that than the majority of films although i didn't really notice the score it must have been okay or i would have noticed it with a negative judgment br br overall wendigo is a very good film that deserves to be watched without <UNK> as long as you don't mind having to think about the movies you watch
<START> what's not to like about this movie every year you know that you're going to get one or two <UNK> tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to <UNK> a real christmas for him what is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it it was a win win situation a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined only if br br drew <UNK> ben affleck was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly <UNK> with his absurd demands it was a fun and funny movie
<START> time has not been kind to this movie once controversial adaptation of jeffrey <UNK> best <UNK> now this film looks like a mere mainstream version of your typical <UNK> gruesome touches aside particularly that crazy over the top finale this is essentially a glossy horror movie for those people that do not care much for the genre it has an extraordinary cast in small roles jose <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> eli <UNK> burgess meredith christopher walken and many others but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive cast in order to convince the audience that this is not your average <UNK> movie producers of '70s disaster movies had a similar idea i kind liked to see the familiar faces but the story is very silly and no matter how high class the film pretends to be it <UNK> at the level of your average '70s exploitation movie not an entirely bad thing though still it is an enjoyable movie especially for those viewers who enjoy <UNK> as usual albert <UNK> <UNK> work is outstanding overall pretty entertaining
<START> i wish more movies were two hours long on the other hand i wish more american civil war movies were merely two hours long gone with the wind <UNK> that's about the length i've come to expect although those two at least entertained for however many hours they lasted and even <UNK> lasted as long as it did because things happened in the course of it br br by contrast ang lee's film is <UNK> and <UNK> it actually feels as if it takes much less than two hours that wasn't a compliment it's really no different to any other form of <UNK> <UNK> at the time it feels as though it will never end afterwards it seems to have taken no time at all br br the film gets off on the wrong foot as lee plays his interminable credits over the opening footage bad mistake in which we are introduced to some characters we take an instant dislike to and will later come to <UNK> the central two are jake the son of german immigrants who are <UNK> supporters of lincoln and jack an equally <UNK> <UNK> whose values jake shares i had to re read that sentence to make sure i hadn't written jack instead of jake at some point or vice versa the two go off to become <UNK> southern <UNK> who so strongly lust after revenge and violence that they can't even be bothered to join the official southern army which i presume they think is for <UNK> i'm afraid lee lost me right there it's easy to feel for characters who make moral mistakes if we have some independent reason to like them or feel as if we know them in some way then their moral flaws can make us care for them all the more not so here we aren't properly introduced to jake for at least an hour when we are it becomes clear he's a <UNK> <UNK> of a man who isn't a <UNK> by choice so much as by habit the kind of person who says and does what everyone around him says and does whose psychology is purely <UNK> the people he associates with are either just the same or positively evil in some uninteresting way i found myself cheering whenever the northern <UNK> appeared on the screen i thought good kill the rebels end the damned war let me go home br br <UNK> this problem is the horrible horrible dialogue everyone speaks in the same whining southern accent i've heard accents from all over the english speaking world and this is the worst of them all i don't care if <UNK> really did talk like that it's simply not fair to ask an audience to listen to it for two hours and believe me we do listen to it for the full two hours lee's picture is a talky one largely because characters take so long to say what they mean in their <UNK> say everything three times <UNK> <UNK> it would help if they talked faster but not much can't these people find a more efficient language in which to communicate br br in short the film is little but a gallery of uniformly unattractive characters with no inner life who talk in an <UNK> ugly mode of speech who don't <UNK> often enough to whom nothing of interest happens despite their being involved in a war good points jewel was nice to look at and so was the scenery but i have complaints even here the cinematography nicely framed looked as if someone had <UNK> colour film for black and white by mistake and as for jewel we were <UNK> with her body but never actually allowed to <UNK> upon it which i think is the least we were <UNK>
<START> legendary director sidney lumet gives us one of his finest films in his historic career in this very tense and ultimately shocking story about a family that includes dysfunctional as one of the children with an a list cast headed by philip seymour hoffman an oscar worthy performance here ethan hawke marisa tomei and albert finney lumet has captured not just elements of <UNK> crime stories such as <UNK> dogs but also family stories such as ordinary people br br many viewers might be confused and feel <UNK> at the construction of the plot lumet has gone with here instead of showing it in a linear manner he has gone the tarantino route and shows the central scene of a robbery gone wrong from different points of view all out of order i personally found this to be very satisfying and left me constantly guessing what was going to happen next the script is very strong with some excellent scenes between husband and wife hoffman and tomei as well as between father and son finney and hoffman all the actors are totally engaging to watch and lumet is obviously having fun in directing a style he usually doesn't delve in plenty of action and suspense to hold the audience for the two hour running time this is a rare movie that doesn't disappoint for one moment
<START> the late dudley moore had the most famous role of his too short career in <UNK> arthur a <UNK> funny and alternately touching tale that <UNK> warm smiles big belly laughs and an occasional tear if you're in the right mood moore received a best actor oscar nomination for his performance as arthur bach a drunken playboy who races cars plays <UNK> <UNK> women but he has <UNK> off and he's his own boss arthur is destined to <UNK> <UNK> million dollars when he marries a <UNK> society girl named susan <UNK> jill <UNK> who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster things get <UNK> when arthur meets linda <UNK> <UNK> minnelli a waitress struggling actress from queens who steals <UNK> for her father's birthday moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years the late sir john gielgud won a best supporting actor oscar for his flawless turn as <UNK> acid <UNK> butler and best friend <UNK> whose <UNK> disdain for <UNK> behavior covers more <UNK> feelings there are other funny <UNK> by barney martin as <UNK> father stephen elliott as <UNK> father and <UNK> fitzgerald as <UNK> demented grandmother the film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named steve gordon who sadly died the following the year there was also a forgettable sequel several years later but this instant classic is not to be missed
<START> lately i have been watching a lot of tom hanks films and old chaplin films and even some of <UNK> <UNK> early bean performances and it seems that all of them have their own unique charm that <UNK> throughout their work something that allows them to identify with audience members of all ages in a way that just makes you feel good a bug's life has that same charm it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily suspend disbelief and accept a lot of talking insects because even though they talk they still act just like real bugs it's like the team that made the movie found a way to bring us into the mind of a child and allow us to think like them to imagine bugs the way a young mind does br br honey i <UNK> the kids was one of my favorite films when i was younger and to me a bug's life is like a more realistic version of that movie if only because the animation is so breathtaking and this style of story telling just opens up so many more narrative possibilities i try not to compare it to something like toy story which i still maintain is the best computer animated film ever made because the story of a bug's life is not quite as good as toy story's but then again almost nothing is the important thing is that it is still wonderful fun br br the story concerns a colony of hard working bugs who have an <UNK> developed society mostly <UNK> around building a <UNK> of food most of which will go to the <UNK> <UNK> vastly superior in strength and general <UNK> and hopefully still leave enough left over for the bugs to make it through the winter we are treated to some visits from the <UNK> who make it clear that if the bugs provide an <UNK> <UNK> of food the consequences will be dire and incidentally the similarities between this <UNK> level of food <UNK> is strikingly similar to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> vicious forcing of food from his own people during the great leap <UNK> br br the fun and excitement begins when <UNK> the main character sets off on a quest to find a gang of appropriate warrior bugs to come back and help defend the colony against the <UNK> you see he <UNK> all of the <UNK> food and placed everyone in great danger so he feels it's his responsibility but he inadvertently ends up hiring a struggling group of <UNK> circus performers great for the audience not so great for the safety of the clan br br the movie was released back in the late 90s when so many films seemed to have been coming out in <UNK> like <UNK> and deep impact independence day and the arrival a bug's life and <UNK> etc comparisons between a bug's life and <UNK> are inevitable although it seems clear to me that a bug's life is by far the superior film and not only because it doesn't star woody allen <UNK> and whining through the lead role this is great family fun
<START> it has been 16 years since it's original run i would have hoped by now some marketing wizard would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now or at least sought to re release the original <UNK> episodes i can't <UNK> why the sci fi or cartoon network haven't <UNK> this up galaxy rangers actually had well thought out plots and even better scripts the animation was above average quality for it's time and excellent when compared to the talking slide show japanese animation of today it <UNK> the heavy <UNK> toy tie in market this may have sealed it's doom too i would willingly spend cash on a dvd of <UNK> if available
<START> i caught this movie on my local movie channel and i rather enjoyed watching the film it has all the elements of a good teen film and more this film aside from dealing with boys girls relationships and sex and the like also deals with the issue of <UNK> use by young people br br the film has that real life feel to it no loud music no special effects and no outrageous scenes which for this movie was right that feel makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film some of which we probably know from where we live br br overall a good movie fun to watch br br 8 10
<START> if only to avoid making this type of film in the future this film is interesting as an experiment but tells no <UNK> story br br one might feel <UNK> for sitting thru it because it touches on so many important issues but it does so without any <UNK> motive the viewer comes away with no new perspectives unless one comes up with one while one's mind wanders as it will <UNK> do during this pointless film br br one might better spend one's time staring out a window at a tree growing br br
<START> finally we have before us a category iii movie for the summer 2006 season made of equal parts cruelty crime and passion dog bite dog benefits not merely from an apt title but also <UNK> direction superb cinematography and respectable performances from most involved of course there has to be a catch <UNK> here in the form of several glaring inconsistencies yet all told <UNK> represents the mature spirit we'd love to see more of in the hk mainstream br br it also marks the <UNK> return of edison <UNK> long absent since the initial d <UNK> of a year ago <UNK> reserved <UNK> does wonders for the movie yet would have had it rough without opposite sam lee whose knack for <UNK> between physical comedy crazy <UNK> the city no problem 2 and lunatic menace has <UNK> in the strongest role we've seen from him since made in hong kong br br together the duo makes dog bite dog and hopefully <UNK> going to get an easier break from now on as a consequence his touch transformed projects from princess d to the <UNK> affairs saga and still he remains a rare <UNK> br br mostly upon <UNK> <UNK> showcases some mesmerizing imagery playing gorgeous tricks with light shadow and perspective the soundtrack <UNK> this atmospheric effect adding to the overall unreal mood the film <UNK> much of the <UNK> combination probably has to do with writer matt <UNK> previously engaged in likewise gruesome three extremes dog bite dog <UNK> numerous traits <UNK> from that horror project namely <UNK> <UNK> and a <UNK> air of something eerie lurking round the corner br br rest assured though this isn't a horror movie instead following a path <UNK> before by classic one <UNK> in <UNK> albeit from a miles more perverse angle replacing daniel <UNK> reluctant <UNK> assassin character we have edison playing a <UNK> killing machine <UNK> from <UNK> underworld sent hong kong way to <UNK> a single target the nearly silent assassin takes care of business immediately upon arrival a process <UNK> depicted courtesy of the film's brilliant visuals br br although <UNK> from childhood to become a professional killer <UNK> eponymous wild dog still has human weaknesses and leaves a trail picked up on by a <UNK> team sent to investigate this <UNK> features a nice cameo by mob movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and good support from tv star wayne <UNK> however sam lee's <UNK> officer <UNK> leads the charge revealing himself to be a highly disturbed individual but excellent cop nonetheless we gradually learn <UNK> inner conflict <UNK> from his father's police corruption background <UNK> demons handy in the relentless pursuit that ensues br br a minor body count <UNK> as edison seems to consider taking prisoners a no no there's quite the violence <UNK> in store even though gore per se feels toned down in places and adult language only makes a token appearance once more no nudity leading one to conclude cat <UNK> are being handed these days a bit <UNK> still <UNK> a relatively mature theatrical release and we applaud its arrival br br in between the fighting stabbing <UNK> and shooting even a career murderer needs some romance and just like daniel wu had <UNK> cheung in one <UNK> so does <UNK> mr <UNK> get a sweetheart done beautifully by new <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her <UNK> character lots of <UNK> in this one meets <UNK> at a strangely deserted <UNK> abused by her father to the point of repulsive madness and yearning for escape when the killer <UNK> hk he agrees to take her with him and they go on the run together love <UNK> en route while the movie doesn't <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> stuff our hearts go out to <UNK> <UNK> tragic character and her endless suffering she <UNK> the <UNK> but <UNK> protagonist amazingly well establishing that there aren't any good or bad guys here <UNK> by the highly <UNK> finale br br director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> includes recent suspense thriller home sweet home and love battlefield with <UNK> chan two numbers likely <UNK> in most accounts by dog bite <UNK> sinister demeanor <UNK> manages to keep <UNK> flowing throughout and considering the many parts in play here stands up to critical standards <UNK> by people like johnny to in his <UNK> <UNK> epic the mission a couple of <UNK> do come about to wit edison miraculously <UNK> off a shot to the chest but these are highly forgivable br br <UNK> <UNK> returns for two young talented performers of the kind hong kong needs if we want the city's movie <UNK> to come back dog bite dog doesn't stand out for story its <UNK> lies in strong portrayals and style <UNK> along on the strength of <UNK> muscle and a keen eye for visual and <UNK> <UNK> br br hk has a long time <UNK> tradition of stories to do with the city's <UNK> alter ego something dog bite dog <UNK> lovingly <UNK> to a solid run if not an outright masterpiece br br rating
<START> take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 <UNK> this was the premise of the show simple yet outrageous funny leave it to fox to throw morality out the window let the <UNK> flow it was like a real life version of <UNK> place the good thing about the show is that it wasn't about people conniving <UNK> each other for a cash prize it was about lust temptation pure and simple the ultimate test for a relationship br br people either loved the show or hated it it was kind of like <UNK> down to look at a horrific traffic accident you know you shouldn't watch but you can't help but look drama aside there was a lot of eye candy
<START> possible spoiler adam sandler is usually <UNK> in comedy but in reign gives a deeply moving performance while there are people who showed courage facing post september 11 2001 sandler plays <UNK> a widower who is lonely and lost in his own world johnson cheadle a practicing dentist encounters his old college buddy sandler and wants to catch up on old times we see as in rain man dustin hoffman <UNK> also gets emotional and <UNK> in <UNK> situations <UNK> music appears to be a comfort and psychological <UNK> for him to lean on br br johnson looks for in <UNK> that certain pleasure and ease missing in his family he also feels unhappy and <UNK> in his job in the same instance he also wants to make sure his friend does not fall through the social cracks i came away from this movie with a different <UNK> and more sympathetic compassion for <UNK> families
<START> my <UNK> rented out this film the other night so we watched it together br br the first impression is actually a positive one because the whole movie is shot in this colorful grainy post mtv <UNK> fast sequences cool angles sweeping camera moves for the moment there you feel like you about to watch another snatch for the moment br br when the plot actually starts unfolding one starts to feel as if one over <UNK> <UNK> things just don't make sense anymore i would hate to spoil the fun of watching it by giving out certain scenes but then again the film is so bad that you are actually better off not watching it br br first you think it is a crime story <UNK> in a conversation between <UNK> knightley and lucy liu wrong this conversation provides no coherent narrative whatsoever rather on the contrary <UNK> lesbian come on on lucy <UNK> character during the second part of the movie just throws the audience into further confusion br br then i thought that maybe it is a movie about a girl from <UNK> but dysfunctional background who grew to be a tough bounty hunter in any case that is the message conveyed by the opening scenes but after that the question of <UNK> character is entirely lost to the criminal plot so in short no this is not a movie about <UNK> character br br then i thought it's probably a story of one robbery a pretty bloody robbery 10 millions went missing bounty hunters are chasing around suspected robbers mafia kids are executed hands are removed domino tries to crack why this time they get no bounty <UNK> etc but soon this impression is <UNK> by another u turn of the plot br br this time we are confronted with a sad story of an <UNK> <UNK> american woman who <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at the local <UNK> and at the age of 28 happens to be a youngest grandmother <UNK> stars on jerry springer show tries to <UNK> some new wacky racial theory and at the same time struggles to find money for her sick <UNK> br br what does this have to do with the main plot <UNK> well nobody knows except that director had to explain the audiences where will bounty hunters put their <UNK> <UNK> of 300 000 br br then at some point you start to think oh it is about our society and the way media <UNK> things there is reality tv crew driving around with the bounty hunters and doing some violent footage the bounty hunters are also stuck with a bunch of hollywood actors who just <UNK> all the time about having their <UNK> broken and themselves dragged around too many crime scenes but no this is not a movie about media they just appear <UNK> throughout the movie br br plus there are numerous other sub plots the crazy <UNK> guy bent on <UNK> afghanistan the love story between domino and <UNK> the <UNK> episode the fbi <UNK> operation br br can all of the things mentioned above be packed into 2 <UNK> movie judge for yourself but my conclusion is clear it is a <UNK> mess
<START> part of the enjoyment that i took from this film <UNK> from the fact that i knew nothing more about it than that it starred john <UNK> and emily watson 2 reasons enough to watch was a period piece and involved chess everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected i <UNK> therefore give away much more suffice to say that <UNK> is magnificent as an eccentric obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and em matches him step for step as the strong minded woman who is drawn to him it's about love and obsession rather than the <UNK> board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour became totally compelling and i defy anyone to second guess the ending
<START> let me start out by saying i can enjoy just about any bad italian horror movie or jungle exploitation flick from the 1970's seriously this one was downright awful br br there are way too many elements that martino tries to <UNK> and none of them work except for the croc gone wild thing very well at all there are some ignorant <UNK> of course who set up a resort in the jungle somewhere i don't even remember where it takes place how sad is that basically people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its' <UNK> but eventually they upset the <UNK> <UNK> of the river who then proceeds to go on a rampage killing said <UNK> and some <UNK> as well sounds good yeah well don't get your hopes up there is minimal violence until the end the special effects are so bad it was like a <UNK> class performed them and the love story thrown in is laughable br br there is seriously a few scenes where it appears they set up a camera underwater in a pool and threw a toy alligator like a <UNK> into the water and that is supposed to be the <UNK> attacking i'm not kidding in another wonderfully crafted special effect a <UNK> van is targeted by the incredible sinking plastic <UNK> who all of a sudden is five times the size of a van a few minutes ago he was only big enough to eat a human but now he <UNK> a full size <UNK> van it is really pathetic the only other flick i can think of where the effects were so bad i was pulled out of the story was bruno <UNK> masterpiece rats what with the plastic rats on the <UNK> belt and all who couldn't be terrified br br normally i'd say anything sergio martino was a solid must see but this one is a must pass waste of time and definitely not worth buying for the 15 <UNK> price from no shame this one is a shame br br 2 out of 10 kids
<START> the <UNK> and pseudo experts consider it a far cry from de <UNK> best the ones suffering from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem connecting to this masterpiece de <UNK> spoke in a very direct way his <UNK> doesn't have the convoluted self examination of modern italian filmmakers or the bitter self parody of <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> of mario <UNK> the <UNK> of visconti or the cold observation of antonioni de <UNK> told us the stories like a father sitting at the edge of his children's bed before they went to sleep there is no attempt to <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> and in a lesser degree <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are realistic fairy tales or what today we call magic realism the film is a gem from beginning to end and <UNK> is the sort of character that you accept with an open heart but that naturally requires for you to have a heart cinema in its <UNK> form magnificent
<START> slow boring extremely repetitive no wonder the <UNK> company did not buy this this <UNK> should eat more <UNK> while filming himself and quit producing there is no way you can watch this and enjoy the preacher is a joke the whole idea is not funny you can make a 2 minute film with this idea not a feature i am so sorry i rented this movie i will never watch anything with the name <UNK> on it it is completely garbage filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal the film states that the american <UNK> and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products making money <UNK> in the system are the base of a healthy economy
<START> i had watched snippets from this as a kid but while i purchased blue <UNK> set immediately due to its being a limited edition only now did i fit it in my viewing schedule and that's mainly because bakshi's american pop 1981 just turned up on late night italian tv see my review of that film below br br anyway i found the film to be a quite good sword and <UNK> animated epic with especially impressive looking backdrops the rather awkward <UNK> characters were admittedly less so with a rousing if derivative score the plot again wasn't exactly original but proved undeniably engaging on a juvenile level and the leading characters well enough developed especially interesting is the villainous ice lord <UNK> and the enigmatic warrior <UNK> the hero and heroine however are rather bland stereotypes but one can hardly complain when bakshi and <UNK> depict the girl as well <UNK> her <UNK> could be torn off any second and half naked to boot her tiny <UNK> are forever disappearing up her ass still it's clearly an action oriented piece and it certainly delivers on this front that involving <UNK> being particularly savage the final showdown though brief is also nicely handled and sees our heroes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> inside a cave br br in the long run apart from the <UNK> mentioned <UNK> backdrops the main appeal of this movie for me now is its nostalgia factor as it transported me back to my childhood days of watching not just films like conan the barbarian 1982 and the <UNK> 1982 but also animated tv series such as <UNK> 1981 <UNK> and he man and the masters of the universe 1983 85 br br as for the accompanying the making of fire and ice tv mark bakshi 1982 1 2 br br vintage <UNK> on the sword and <UNK> animated film which is only available via the washed out vhs print owned by ralph bakshi himself it goes into some detail about the <UNK> technique and also shows several instances of live action <UNK> in a studio of segments from the script which would then be <UNK> <UNK> in with the backgrounds and filmed still having watched several such behind the scenes <UNK> on the art of animation on the disney <UNK> and the looney tunes sets for instance it's doesn't make for a very compelling piece
<START> a super unusual film from <UNK> read my lips is a <UNK> lonely hearts thriller it's perfect for the <UNK> <UNK> charisma of vincent <UNK> and features a <UNK> contained performance from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a recurring feature of <UNK> in the same way that <UNK> <UNK> pops up for jean pierre <UNK> <UNK> beautiful she's referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film versatile and capable of a <UNK> profile br br this is almost the definition of her role as carla a put upon office <UNK> <UNK> by colleagues <UNK> her <UNK> yet she finds an <UNK> <UNK> if you like in <UNK> ex con paul each exploits the other's unconventional talents <UNK> and lip reading to struggle through their respective situations and form an <UNK> romantic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> manage <UNK> <UNK> and its attendant <UNK> inner world with <UNK> stylish flair br br in this film 2001 <UNK> is already clearly in control of his handling on tension action and <UNK> his frame with a truly visceral experience which will become the great hit a prophet of nine years later 7 10
<START> cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less vanessa redgrave is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret love br br this is one of those movies which has the look and expectations of being a great film simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be about something other than the <UNK> that it really is not bad as such but with redgrave toni collette glenn close meryl streep <UNK> danes natasha richardson <UNK> <UNK> patrick wilson hugh <UNK> and others all giving fine performances you expect more than a <UNK> story thats a bit more than a <UNK> romance br br wait for cable
<START> i saw this film on television years ago but here several years after i wake up in the morning and still remember her face br br this film is the most profoundly terrifying film i have seen
<START> i saw this independent film when it was in philadelphia and it was a pleasant surprise i left the theater with a smile on my face one of the things that made it so funny was that it was based on a true story hilarious it has some great character actors in it too <UNK> sterling is in it and is very good i loved her in austin powers howard <UNK> is also terrific i remember him from head of the class i am tired of all the dark edgy movies that keep getting made this is fun and light and i can watch it with my family and not be embarrassed i keep checking to see when it will come out on dvd i will definitely buy it
<START> i saw this movie twice i can't believe <UNK> made such a fantasy movie i'm also a movie theatre director and i know what i speak this is not romania anymore but i see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 september no story no plot nothing no conclusion no message nothing profound nothing hidden just empty images br br what most of <UNK> don't know this movie is for the french viewers not for us they really believe that is the reality in romania also for teenagers <UNK> should stop making movies i don't really know if we can call this a movie maybe a horror and we wonder why we've got such an image in europe this was a reality but isn't anymore a good friend of mine from the <UNK> <UNK> said you have no idea what a long way romanian people walked from <UNK>
<START> disney have done it again brilliant the way <UNK> and pumbaa are brought back to life yet again to tell us how they came to meet and help <UNK> when he needed them i love this film and watch it over and over again it shows how <UNK> lived with his family and fellow <UNK> before setting off to find his dream home and adventure then he meets pumbaa and things do change together they search for the home timon wants and repeatedly fail which is funny as <UNK> gets more and more crazy then <UNK> turns up and we see more of his childhood than we did in the previous 2 films the rest you already know
<START> ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man john carradine dying and leaving everything to his four children and his servants to be divided up equally one condition they must spend one week in his estate to get the money and if any of them die the others get more guess what happens next br br i saw a brand new print of this film on cable the colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful that's about all the good things i can say about it br br let's list just some of the problems this film has the killer is <UNK> obvious the servants are called <UNK> and <UNK> come on some of the sound recording was so bad i couldn't make out the dialogue no great loss i'm sure the gore was sparse and very poorly done the other murders were simply boring stupid or impossible and this movie contains some truly <UNK> acting so bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief even pro jeff <UNK> was terrible the only fairly good acting was from <UNK> faith <UNK> who deserved better than this and john carradine who looks painfully old and <UNK> here i do have to admit though the closing line in this movie is a gem br br why this was <UNK> legacy of blood is beyond me there's another 1978 horror film with that name br br whatever its name is it's a bad movie to be avoided at all costs
<START> boy girl love affair sequel with songs only this time she's the <UNK> and he's the straight arrow movie buffs out there actually like this movie it has fans i must say the mind <UNK> grease 2 is a truly lame enterprise that doesn't even have the courage <UNK> or sheer <UNK> to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames like jaws 2 or exorcist ii no it <UNK> along in slow motion and often just plays dead it looks and feels cheap with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and <UNK> handling this was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of michelle pfeiffer and although she doesn't embarrass herself it's a role worth forgetting a misfire on the lowest of levels no stars from
<START> one of the biggest hits of <UNK> brown of <UNK> is a exciting comedy drama featuring <UNK> and football scenes that gave william haines the role he needed to become a major star it's <UNK> haines all the way <UNK> smart <UNK> who takes nothing serious until he is rejected by everyone <UNK> up and becomes a man hero and wins the girl no one worked this formula like haines a terrific comic actor little annie rooney with mary pickford show people with marion davies haines could swing from comedy to tragedy with a change in facial expression he is a total joy in this film as he was in tell it to the marines with <UNK> <UNK> and west point with joan crawford where he repeats the formula mary brian is good as the girl jack pickford is very good as the <UNK> roommate ralph <UNK> is the rival edward <UNK> mary <UNK> david <UNK> <UNK> williams and grady <UNK> co star this film is noted now for its <UNK> relationship between haines and pickford and for being john wayne's film debut as a <UNK> football player but i never spotted him haines was a top five box office star starting with this picture through 1932 it's a shame he has been largely forgotten and that most of his films appear to be lost he was one of the most appealing and talented actors of his time
<START> without being one of my favorites this is good for being a change of pace even if only for a few minutes br br it all starts with a big fight between tom jerry and spike who is <UNK> butch here they're all beating each other but suddenly spike makes a heroic and admirable decision he stops the fight and suggests that they all should be friends so all of them sign a peace <UNK> and become friends which isn't going to last for long br br meanwhile the three become <UNK> patient and kind to each other they even save each other when one of them is in danger of life the relationship goes nothing but excellent until a very big <UNK> appears and they all become greedy the three are guilty to return to their usual fights and <UNK> br br but still to see tom jerry and spike as friends is truly a delightful and grateful experience even if only for a while br br oh by the way as a curious fact two songs from the wizard of oz are played here in <UNK> versions we're off to see the wizard and somewhere over the <UNK>
<START> this was one of the most ridiculous and badly directed movies i've seen in a very long time i've never liked spike lee but thought i'd give this one a try bad mistake the movie is supposed to show how the son of sam real life murders affected a neighborhood in the summer of 1977 what it really did was center around the most boring characters that i doubt anyone cared for as far as their drug problems marriage problems and so on etc the scenes that depict the murders are just that and nothing more a shooting and then it's back to saturday night fever what's even more ridiculous is spike lee's choice to show up as a reporter in the movie spike trust me you're no hitchcock stay out of the movies it makes them even worse off the most silly scene had to be the dog speaking in a goofy voice which was depicted in a scene before it where it was supposed to have been shot spike what were you thinking when you made this film not thinking at all is my guess people who think they'll see a crime drama take my advice and do not waste your time or money on this loser you're better off watching jerry springer in this case waste of film i gave it a 1 out of 10 awful dud
<START> as an army veteran i was deeply offended by this film in my opinion it is a disgrace to those who fought in the vietnam war to say that the real sf soldiers i knew were offended by this crap is an understatement if the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon it was it would have been better received but it was taken seriously my many people especially overseas silly as it sounds wherever i went in europe in the late 80's people seemed to judge me and americans in general by this film unrealistic hmm let's see a <UNK> muscle bound <UNK> is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to se asia to free some american <UNK> in a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an m 60 machine gun that never runs out of <UNK> and never <UNK> and he never misses running with a <UNK> gun held up with one arm i could go on but i'm getting a headache i gave this a 2 10 only because it's slightly better than rambo iii
<START> you have a strong stomach <UNK> was actually <UNK> years old at filming but looked near 70 and he only lived another 8 years at one point <UNK> said i am over twice your age okay try triple grandpa the old enough to be your father theme they were shooting for didn't work granted senior citizens sometimes wind up with legal teens more power to them but that doesn't mean i want to watch it it's not a matter of judgment but the <UNK> track i like my food where it belongs <UNK> is fun to watch and the 70s cars clothes furniture etc make it worth it if it comes on cable late at night and you want to watch something to wind down for bed it would have been nice to see the blonde friend of <UNK> the one who <UNK> her guitar get more scenes <UNK> spacey who was this chick i'm going to try and find out
<START> i went to a screening of this movie and while it had a couple moments that made me laugh it had some very major flaws it first of all presents itself to be the humorous exploits of a real life <UNK> trying to find love in la what it <UNK> into is a depressing <UNK> and unfunny romp through the history of the film director's love life and professional life jokes wear thin quickly and you find yourself suddenly not caring how this man's dates progress the <UNK> is that the director simultaneously presents himself as an extremely annoying and heavily flawed character and then expects us to be concerned
<START> i don't buy kung fu movies for a plot i buy them for fight scenes a bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fight scenes but not the other way around br br the story was decent but moved too slowly for my tastes there were about 3 or 4 mediocre fight scenes throughout lasting only a couple of minutes <UNK> the last fight was a bit longer but by that point i was so bored i didn't even pay attention to it
<START> strange almost all reviewers are highly positive about this movie is it because it's from 1975 and has chamberlain and curtis in it and therefore forgive the by times very bad acting and childish ways of storytelling br br maybe it's because some people get sentimental about this film because they have read the book i have not read the book but i don't think that's a problem film makers never presume that the viewers have read the book br br or is it because i am <UNK> irritated about the fact that english speaking actors try to behave as their french counterparts
<START> i first saw the trailer for <UNK> on <UNK> movies way back in the day after hearing stephen king praise it to high heaven not really a fan of either star i still wanted to see it because i'm a huge thriller fan br br i was not disappointed the acting was superb especially from the two young boys usually i <UNK> child actors but young adam and young <UNK> were excellent bill paxton really did a good job of directing it too it was beautifully shot br br one must also note the plot twists the three twists at the end hit hard and fast and i didn't see them coming the final twist of the film coupled with the gravity of what had just been revealed gives me chills to this day even though i've re watched the film so many times br br a true gem
<START> i don't know where to begin so i'll begin with a <UNK> from the back of the cover of this movie alive combines the tension of vincenzo <UNK> cube with <UNK> own versus i have not seen versus so i can't comment on that but i think cube was an excellent movie which i recommend to everyone however in this case someone has clearly confused tension with boredom br br i'll just go ahead and spoil the entire plot because besides being one holy swiss cheese of a plot it's also <UNK> cheese and the movie is not worth spending any time on even if you don't know the plot beforehand so it doesn't matter if i have misunderstood the plot don't hit me it's probably because i had to struggle to keep my <UNK> open br br so the american military in <UNK> once lost a <UNK> i the <UNK> desert this apparently makes sense because they're both <UNK> so surely they're practically the same place different <UNK> or not a monkey broke into the <UNK> and acquired an alien something which was passed on to a japanese <UNK> who had to eat the monkey to survive in the desert what ever the alien thing is now passed on to anyone who's <UNK> enough to kill the current host the japanese military wants to use it for military stuff so they decide to make it pass from the current host the <UNK> daughter to some other dude but instead of just picking someone out of the military which is full of people who are <UNK> and already on the <UNK> side they decide that it's probably a good idea to pick some criminal out of death row instead oh and the reason they pick this particular criminal from death row is because he was the first person in history to not die from the non lethal electric shock which is the standard execution method because everyone dies from the <UNK> effect when they get <UNK> i don't know if they do this so they can giggle in the staff room at how everyone dies even though it's not deadly or if they just want to cut down the electricity bill br br then the movie turns into what the matrix would have been if it had been really lame and superfluous fighting <UNK> us to tears for what feels like an hour and oh wait now they remember that they already had a dude who was infected with the alien thing so the entire movie up to this point was actually a totally waste of time and also human lives then everyone dies the end br br the only one moment in the movie where i didn't want to go away and sleep or eat a <UNK> instead was when a dude was <UNK> to a wall by a <UNK> through his chest and he's hanging around up there and another dude walks by the dude hanging on the wall says i'm in pain shoot me and the living dude looks at him and it's not like he's a mean dude or anything so he really looks <UNK> and doesn't want the guy on the wall to suffer so he shoots him br br <UNK> pause br br in the stomach gee thanks a <UNK> heap
<START> i am not a huge fan of camp <UNK> and the so bad it's good type of viewing however i really like this film for its fun factor and believe it or not it's <UNK> br br the whole thing has a ring of john waters and is <UNK> enthusiastic but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and <UNK> movements billy zane moves with incredible expression see the scene on the bus for a text book lesson in how to use movement and is framed by some unexpected stars br br you may not like this film you may not enjoy it but if you get the chance to watch it then spare the time because chances are you will end the film with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars highly <UNK>
<START> there are moments in the film that are so dreadful your teeth <UNK> but knowing that there were only weeks left before the code made movies <UNK> and bland paramount rushed this into production before innuendo and <UNK> went out of style <UNK> is so <UNK> anti female that it's delicious as kitty <UNK> sings women are displayed with price <UNK> that would insult a <UNK> hooker they emerge from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> of absolute <UNK> <UNK> of the law so stupid they cannot find the door get to look up their <UNK> and <UNK> bare <UNK> chorus girls sit <UNK> in giant <UNK> could they be a source of <UNK> perhaps while we listen to sweet marijuana and watch as blood falls on a <UNK> breast br br sure carl <UNK> learned his lines <UNK> and doesn't seem to have a clue what he is saying but it's all worth it as norma steals the show while no one is looking br br taking one moment of this fragile fluff seriously is missing the point of the whole exercise watch this with a <UNK> member of now and prepare to justify the whole hollywood <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> between body blows br br toby wing by the way is the <UNK> on the cake and duke <UNK> doesn't hurt either br br a must <UNK> down memory lane
<START> the only saving grace of this movie is that it serves as the 0 end of the movie rating scale now if i see a movie that really stinks i say this movie was a real pecker i believe this movie is a perfect example of christina <UNK> one dimensional acting horrible
<START> i had high expectations for this indie having <UNK> the many thumbs up reviews then br br here's my additional <UNK> <UNK> to the already posted excellent <UNK> in <UNK> review premise morgan is <UNK> in a dusty small town where he meets lovely scarlet who is working in the local supermarket can morgan help elevate the lovely scarlet from her trailer trash life br br realistic dialog not how about that shopping in target first freeman looks at the target interior as if he's walked into <UNK> then he's <UNK> over at a t shirt rack <UNK> he has never been in any store visited by lovely scarlet morgan is detached from any and all aspects of <UNK> reality and is portrayed as <UNK> in his ignorance of everyone and everything in <UNK> life br br one reviewer enjoyed the scarlet and ex <UNK> fight scene where her survival a car in this instance requires she physically attack her ex <UNK> does freeman run to her defense <UNK> he's <UNK> in disbelief and totally incapable of dealing with such a blunt aspect of her very real sorry lot in life br br <UNK> character believes a car wash and new very revealing tight fitting <UNK> is the key to <UNK> job interview another sign that freeman is clueless <UNK> endless <UNK> <UNK> where all aspects of <UNK> reality are reduced to one or another stage related freeman experience was irritating br br freeman is right to emphasize that scarlet is young with her future ahead of her and then conveniently ignores the brick walls she faces <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> no white collar skills or experience very poor no family support and a lifetime of low self <UNK> scarlet learns such life lessons from freeman as some people pay 100 for a t shirt and a revealing <UNK> may open doors in <UNK> of her lack of education and white collar job skills in the end freeman offers scarlet little more than strange <UNK> with a <UNK> not even paying for gas for <UNK> dead of night return to her <UNK> life in a town the name of which freeman cares not to know
<START> do not waste your time with this movie this is a total <UNK> in terms of acting directing sound editing soundtrack there was such a waste of performance by some of the very good actors the movie does not do justice to <UNK> <UNK> who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in bollywood akshay kumar who is also an <UNK> star did quite a poor job john abraham what is wrong with him is that what you call acting i mean he should thank god that he has a pretty face otherwise he'd be winning <UNK> awards in india if there were any such awards in bollywood <UNK> a great talent but <UNK> his bit as before br br screenplay which was not to mention a rip off from the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was quite badly framed first of all people in bollywood just can't make something original on top of that they don't even know how to copy well the jokes in the movie were so overdone it was getting painful to sit through them <UNK> may be a star in the south but he's just not fit to make a decent hindi movie the sound editing is amazingly crappy i can go on and on this matter but the bottom line is that bollywood should be shameful of making such a film br br the worst part is that some people seemed to love this movie what is wrong with you guys this is the reason why bollywood is where it is did you know that bollywood makes more movies than hollywood every year however most of the movies are <UNK> of abroad because of movies like this one i am an indian and i am utterly shameful of bollywood for producing this piece of <UNK> movies like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> were just terrific they are world class films which are timeless among the best of this decade <UNK> <UNK> however is perhaps one of the worst of this century period br br i give it a 1 out of 10
<START> almost 30 years later i recall this original <UNK> film as almost <UNK> tender <UNK> i check here at imdb hoping that someone has had the good sense to purchase the rights and put it on a dvd it's september of 2004 and i keep hoping deep sigh br br one of the two lead actors went on to a small career primarily in a prime time evening soap the other frances lee <UNK> was seen in small roles here and there for a few years but nothing they did before or after ever matched this little movie which was produced as i recall it on a short lived <UNK> series which <UNK> original screenplays by new and up and coming <UNK> br br i watched it every time it was shown on <UNK> maybe 2 or 3 times that was before the era of <UNK> so i have no record of it except in my <UNK> eye br br 12 <UNK> 2006 addition to above happy new year ladies this wonderful film is finally available on dvd at <UNK> <UNK> my understanding is that the dvds are burned from the writer's own personal copy
<START> i'm no horror movie buff but my wife's <UNK> and <UNK> are so i saw the first movie it was gruesome and tense but not my taste still good though for similar reasons at this very moment i am being exposed to a sequel br br the premise itself is beyond absurd i can buy that disasters occur in the desert i can buy that mutants exists i can even buy that the events might be so weird and strange that the military may decide to get involved it is unlikely yes but i'm willing to suspend my belief br br however under no circumstances am i willing to believe that the military squad assigned to <UNK> such an area would be unable to <UNK> off the mutants being a member of the united states army i can assure that while fresh <UNK> may lack the seasoned eyes and experience of combat soldiers any such <UNK> would be integrated into a capable squad br br a squad of armed soldiers is not about to be taken out by a few mutants with knives that's just the way it works squad movements vastly superior <UNK> and of course radio support would ensure nothing less than total victory i'm not saying you wouldn't have <UNK> but as soon as the area was <UNK> as hostile military training would take <UNK> no one would go off on their own even to use the bathroom br br and if it were discovered that the area was so <UNK> with <UNK> that the squad was unable to handle the danger they would radio in for <UNK> and believe me their <UNK> would not be <UNK> if there was a chance that normal <UNK> would not do the squad would have a military issue satellite phone chances are if they were unable to check in every hour a search would be called br br in order to accept this movie you must accept that our soldiers are incompetent fools with incompetent leaders and an incompetent chain of command while it may still be true that the most dangerous thing in the world is a lieutenant with a map and <UNK> our military forces are filled with intelligent well trained competent soldiers mutants with knives are far below our ability to deal with br br with the whole execution of the movie depending <UNK> on the impossible to imagine the film fails to deliver instead we are expected to believe that our soldiers sailors and <UNK> are incapable of dealing with even the most mediocre <UNK> br br as a combat veteran i find the movie insulting
<START> happy go lovely has only two things going for it and those two things are vera <UNK> legs this is a british <UNK> films version of an m g m musical complete with second <UNK> stars i would imagine that vera ellen took this role thinking that it might finally <UNK> her to the status of a major musical star but i'm sorry to say ms <UNK> chance did not pay off br br opening with a horrible scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy the predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin and with the exception of david niven <UNK> romero who is way over the top in his role of a producer and bobby <UNK> who is totally wasted in a nothing role the rest of the cast is totally forgettable br br the choreography is boring but ms ellen gives it her all she was never as famous as most of the other musical stars and she shouldn't be since she couldn't sing and even had a dancing stand in in several of her pictures but when she did dance it was just <UNK> br br it's too bad that this film that could have made her a star did not give her the tools she needed to shine br br 4 out of 10
<START> this is exactly the type of film that <UNK> me the most great cast great director great story potential then they ruin it all with a screenplay that goes nowhere and says nothing while going there there is no depth here whatsoever no depth of characters no depth of plot no depth of surprise suspense or common sense we know what's happening we are told how they plan to fix the problem they fix the problem throw a surprise at us near the end that fails to generate any suspense then they end the film abruptly wasted opportunity br br on the plus side glenn ford leads a cast of uk and one french actors who are all fantastic doing an incredibly impressive job with the one dimensional writing they were given one of the absolute favorites is herbert <UNK> as old charlie who provides some wonderful bits of humor and warmth to a dark and serious film i also thought the film had a great look to it all shadows and fog very film noir in feel br br even though the actors do the best they can and the directing is enjoyable it still just isn't enough for me to recommend spending the time to view the film there are far better glenn ford movies out there the big heat <UNK> affair in <UNK> etc
<START> is just as good as the original very nearly achieves greatness because of <UNK> remarkable ear for music and dialogue <UNK> the self important <UNK> of the hip hop <UNK> the group <UNK> with hats <UNK> are every rap group you ever heard and utterly self <UNK> wardrobe is unbelievable buy the <UNK> soundtrack if you can
<START> mr <UNK> gives a standout performance as usual sadly he has to struggle with an <UNK> script and some nonsensical set pieces br br <UNK> is in die hard mode complete with <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i'm sure he could do better but seems satisfied to <UNK> and <UNK> through his part br br the lovely erika is very <UNK> even though fully <UNK> and shows some signs of getting acting at last br br <UNK> are mainly poor cgi and steals from other movies br br the <UNK> are pitiful worthy of the a team br br not even worth seeing for <UNK> avoid
<START> i have loved this movie since i first saw it in 1979 i'm still amazed at how accurately kurt russell portrays elvis right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face sometimes its scary how much he looks acts and talks like the real elvis thankfully this is being released on dvd so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film i have heard the <UNK> who say that there are some inaccuracies or some things left out but i think that keeping in mind that john carpenter only had about 2 1 2 hours to work with and that this was being shown on television just two years after <UNK> death that he did a fine job with this in fact i haven't seen another elvis movie that even comes close to this one highly recommended
<START> i and a friend rented this movie we both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be <UNK> the movie's plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending we both agreed that the movie could have been <UNK> into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot
<START> spoilers many different comedy series nowadays have at one point or another <UNK> with the idea of obscure independence in an early episode of cartoon family guy the <UNK> family find their home is an independent nation to the united states of america and the story progresses from there way back in 1949 however the ealing studios produced a wonderful little film along the same idea br br after a child's prank the residents of <UNK> discover a small fortune in treasure at the <UNK> it becomes clear that the small area is a small <UNK> of the long lost state of <UNK> <UNK> from london and the rest of great britain the residents of the small street experience the <UNK> and the problems with being an independent state br br based at a time when <UNK> was still in operation this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring featuring performances by stanley <UNK> betty warren philip <UNK> and a young charles <UNK> the film is well <UNK> with some of the finest actors of their generation these actors are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking lines feeling remarkably fresh despite being over 50 years old the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertained br br ealing studios was one of the finest <UNK> of british film ever in existence with films like <UNK> to <UNK> it's not difficult to see why amusing from start to finish the story is always fun and always worth watching
<START> i have the entire <UNK> tarzan series on dvd fully restored <UNK> i never tire of watching them my personal favorite is tarzan and his mate due entirely well almost entirely to maureen <UNK> costume and the occasional flashes of her <UNK> area beneath that leather <UNK> hanging in front before anyone claims that a it wasn't really her or b it wasn't really what it looks like let me say that i have watched it numerous time in high zoom mode and trust me it is her and she is completely naked underneath that costume several times especially during the lion attack at the end careful viewing in slow motion and maximum zoom will reveal that she was <UNK> except for a tiny <UNK> of dark hair covering her <UNK> there is no mistake about that at all as to the swimming scene being a body double in a skin suit yes it is a double but she is not wearing any skin suit or anything else again slow motion and maximum zoom shows everything to those who want to see it now that controversy out of the way let's move on the actual movie i thought the script was really well thought out and written tightly the action sequences were simply great although it is obviously a <UNK> riding the <UNK> <UNK> actually <UNK> the big male lion the use of background shots that were second unit stuff from africa is very well <UNK> with the studio us locations making it sometimes hard to tell which is which don't complain too much though remember that 90 of all films is phony anyway so just relax and enjoy the damned thing with a big bowl of popcorn some cold beer and a fresh pack of <UNK> a sexy and willing girlfriend wife isn't out of line either lol oh one final word about nudity at the very beginning while the white hunters are speaking dialogue keep your eyes on the background extras there are several good shots of nude african girls obviously shot on location behind them one more thing the movie is not racist by the standards of the 1930's until the 1960's that's the way colored people were thought of and portrayed back then <UNK> hadn't even been thought about at that time nor would audiences have accepted any other portrayals of them at the time in history <UNK> actually did use natives carrying <UNK> on their heads and <UNK> character did die a heroic death trying to save the white hunters and jane as a matter of fact it wasn't until gene <UNK> treated the native americans and colored people in his westerns like real human beings that hollywood began to see that it was okay to do so
<START> this film has been on my wish list for ten years and i only recently found it on dvd when my <UNK> <UNK> was given it he watched it at and was thrilled to learn that it was about my generation born in 1930 and <UNK> in 1939 and he wanted to know more about it and me luckily i borrowed it from him and watched it on my own and i cried all through it not only did it capture the emotions the class distinction the <UNK> and the warmth of human relationships of those years as well as the <UNK> spoken and <UNK> but it was accurate i am also a bit of an <UNK> when it comes to <UNK> uniforms <UNK> <UNK> in the right colour white and all the <UNK> of the management of bomb sites and the work of the heavy rescue <UNK> i couldn't fault any of this from my memories and the <UNK> anderson shelter and the <UNK> <UNK> brought it all back the difference between the relatively <UNK> life in the village and war torn london was also <UNK> presented i re lived 1939 40 and my own <UNK> from london with this production i know jack <UNK> work of course and one would expect no more from him than this <UNK> detail but it went far beyond the accurate representation of the facts and touched deep <UNK> about human <UNK> and the only half <UNK> value <UNK> of those years it was certainly one of the great high spots in john <UNK> acting career and of <UNK> direction and deserves to be better known it is a magnificent film and i have already ordered a couple of copies to send to friends
<START> i believe this is the most powerful film hbo pictures has made to date this film should have been released in theaters for the public to view on the big screen it is available on video so make sure you look for it and check it out chris <UNK> did a great job with the direction and the screenplay the performances from stephen rea donald sutherland and <UNK> <UNK> are flawless a masterpiece of the genre
<START> well if you are looking for a great mind control movie this is it no movie has had so many gorgeous women under mind control and naked marie <UNK> as the <UNK> <UNK> is under just about <UNK> she falls asleep and a few times when she isn't one wishes they made more movies like this one
<START> for animation buffs it's a must but even general audiences will enjoy the <UNK> revenge a very early example of <UNK> by the hard working <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> manipulated a cast of <UNK> <UNK> figures to tell this story <UNK> the way for the likes of willis o'brien george pal ray <UNK> and <UNK> of modern digital effect creators br br the <UNK> revenge is only about 10 minutes long but packs in lots of amusing detail as the story follows the <UNK> adventures of two <UNK> from their home to a nightclub a hotel a cinema and eventually a prison cell there are two brief dance numbers at the nightclub performed by a frog and a <UNK> a <UNK> between a beetle and a <UNK> and a large scale <UNK> at the cinema which ends with the <UNK> <UNK> into flames pretty elaborate goings on for <UNK> when even john <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> were just getting started and walt disney was still in grade school br br it's interesting to note too what an impact the <UNK> of a silent movie's title cards can have on the story being told i've seen two versions of this film offered by two video companies and watched them back to back and although the image content itself is almost identical two different sets of <UNK> tell two very different stories and the plot outline someone provided above tells yet a third story which suggests that there's another version out there somewhere the british film <UNK> print which has <UNK> <UNK> tells the story of two sibling <UNK> each secretly married who hide this information from one another in order to <UNK> their late father's fortune the other russian print tells a simpler story of married <UNK> who are each guilty of infidelity in the russian version mr beetle visits his girlfriend at the gay <UNK> nightclub while in the english version brother bill beetle visits his wife at the music hall personally i prefer the straightforward and <UNK> russian story the <UNK> version tries to <UNK> too much plot into what should be a simple tale and some of the <UNK> are a bit awkward br br still in any rendition the <UNK> revenge is a delightful film and would make an ideal lead in to that other great animated work which features <UNK> yellow submarine
<START> i love this film <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> i was born in leigh a town about 7 miles away from <UNK> i moved to <UNK> in 1965 when i was 20 my place of work was daily via little <UNK> through <UNK> sometimes on a bike but then by car when i could afford it the film brings back all the memories of the working class neighbors who were almost always broke but who would always help you if they could fred <UNK> was round the corner from <UNK> st were my <UNK> was if you didn't see the film when first released then you may be forgiven for comparing it to a soap such as <UNK> st well i agree it is a soap but then it was called <UNK> sink drama ' watch this film for the talented cast who shortly afterwards became household names from frequent roles on tv i watch mainly for the shots of the <UNK> and the feel good factor of people being poor but happy
<START> <UNK> <UNK> pan translated as fresh baked japanese bread is the story of a young man named <UNK> <UNK> and his journey to make the perfect japanese bread or <UNK> pan for japan and for the japanese that will be recognized the the whole world br br of course that's just on the outside in reality <UNK> <UNK> pan isn't really about the bread but the reaction that come after eating the bread and the pun that comes with the reaction the series is lovable because of these <UNK> from popular anime titles like <UNK> detective conan and dragon ball to blockbuster movies like the matrix and lord of the rings it's all there br br so what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre like cooking master boy or mr <UNK> well unlike the others who use cooking for world <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pan is purely comedy sure there are times that the story turns to drama or even murder but the comedic atmosphere makes you laugh at them you'll be laughing at their own view of heaven just watch it br br just remember that this is also fiction although some of the bread made here are based on real bread eating the home made japan 2 won't turn you to a super <UNK> or turn your body to rubber
<START> the explosion of tv channels must be <UNK> grateful to the randolph scott western production line because any any moment there must be one of what seems like a hundred randolph scott movies playing on at least one no budget station br br man behind the gun is a typical early 1950's period melodrama with pre wwii production values that relies on a historically <UNK> murder mystery plot <UNK> with action scenes to disguise the <UNK> complete absence of character development and thus lack of suspense in years to come the role of these films would be taken over by tv shows like <UNK> <UNK> etc and these actually did the job better randolph scott looking particularly <UNK> in this is the good guy struggling against the bad guys against whom he will eventually <UNK> there's no more interest in what he goes through emotionally than in what his horse is feeling unless you count wondering whether he'll sort out the initial <UNK> with the female lead by the end the music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the <UNK> than the acting is but it's fine if that <UNK> your boat and i wouldn't <UNK> you for enjoying <UNK> <UNK> either br br <UNK> pedestrian and <UNK> rapidly 3 stars for being competently put together 0 for artistic <UNK>
<START> i enjoy ralph bakshi films <UNK> cool world and the underrated animated lord of the rings and am a frank <UNK> collector and fan i am also a sword and <UNK> fan who loves the worlds of edgar rice <UNK> and robert e howard br br i missed fire and <UNK> theatrical release back in 1983 and have looked forward to seeing it on video or at some revival ever since then therefore the 2005 release was a dream come true for me however i bought it with some <UNK> because i hoped it would not be only worth watching once and then put on the shelf as a <UNK> gathering dust until the day i died fortunately my fears were <UNK> and i was pleasantly impressed with this movie br br as with <UNK> art this is a gritty film that has a <UNK> and sexuality that is hard to find in most fantasy sword and <UNK> films without being cheesy or dirty the art is good and you see glimpses of <UNK> at his best even my young boys loved watching it with me and ask to watch it again and again however my wife has some <UNK> due to the scantily clad princess very <UNK> esquire i don't mind that because it is believable and there is no sex scene br br there is <UNK> <UNK> used but personally i enjoy <UNK> <UNK> it gives more fluid and realistic movements to the characters that is hard to find in animation br br despite some continuity problems i recommend this film to all bakshi <UNK> conan and sword and <UNK> fans enjoy
<START> bette midler is <UNK> in this concert she gives her all every time she is on stage whether we are laughing at her jokes and antics or <UNK> our eyes at the <UNK> of one of her tremendous <UNK> bette midler moves her audience if you can't see it live which is the best way to see bette then this is the next best thing an interesting thing to look at is how incredible her voice has changed and <UNK> over the years but never lost its power her more <UNK> correct version of stay with me never loses anything in spirit from the rose or divine madness here it is just more pure and as heartfelt as ever i will treasure this concert for a very long time
<START> <UNK> is much more of a coming of age story than it is a fight flick and what a relief to have one in an urban school with <UNK> realistic <UNK> and believable use of brooklyn project settings br br it made me realize that virtually all hollywood high school movies are set in <UNK> <UNK> or small towns even the somewhat comparable love and basketball which focused on teen african americans was set in <UNK> while these kids share some of the same <UNK> problems those issues shrink compared to the other struggles of these kids where high school <UNK> could be the major accomplishment of their lives br br the feminist element here is riveting in its originality as you hold your breath to see if she can have a relationship and a victory on her terms a lots of audience sympathy goes to the guy who is challenged to rise to a gender <UNK> expectations situation br br the movie does drag a bit here and there but this is no cheap thrills rocky fight movie as the practices and fights have complex <UNK> and all the relationships especially with fathers and father figures take more center stage than the center ring br br there were lots of interesting music credits listed at the end but i hadn't really noticed the songs br br originally written 10 7 2000
<START> this is the one in which the <UNK> ruth gordon plays an agatha christie type of murder mystery author who locks her nephew by marriage into a safe gordon believes that he murdered her niece and the young fellow dies of <UNK> while gordon is traveling back and forth to new york he manages however to leave behind some clues <UNK> on a couple of black safe <UNK> boxes and an improvised and well hidden note columbo enters the case suspects her at once and <UNK> the mystery by simply using his supernatural mystical <UNK> powers oh and <UNK> hartley is on hand as <UNK> secretary and would be <UNK> hartley is i believe the grand daughter of the psychologist b f <UNK> i'm not sure her <UNK> had anything to do with her attractive belly button which is on display during a belly dance sequence but i've always admired <UNK> anyway br br the murder is well handled it's a good plot and none of the performers or crew fluff anything but the outstanding figure here is ruth gordon only a <UNK> over five feet tall she was over 80 years old and looked it there are moments when she almost <UNK> but she consistently exudes charm her acting is <UNK> you can never be sure when she's being serious or when she's putting columbo and the audience on she's given some good lines too what humor there is comes from gordon columbo doesn't have any of his frequent comic moments br br all in all a nice job by everyone concerned
<START> i read <UNK> book same title as this film when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of <UNK> his own and the people of the amazon with whom he lived and loved to a way of living a decent life his subsequent books were not as powerful but showed his continuing quest his description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60's but his honesty and <UNK> about it were welcome this movie beautifully conveys both the <UNK> and <UNK> of the man but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence which is not a morally positive term in this case that occurs when <UNK> men <UNK> on traditional societies even so <UNK> himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own <UNK>
<START> a 14 year old girl develops her first serious crush on the 17 year old boy that lives near by while simultaneously trying to overcome her feelings of <UNK> in comparison to her older sister that is the simple premise of this beautiful poetic coming of age film from director robert <UNK> <UNK> is famous for previously directing summer of <UNK> in 1971 and to kill a <UNK> in <UNK> two giants of the coming of age genre here he directs <UNK> in the principal roles reese <UNK> in her film debut as the 14 year old girl emily <UNK> as the older sister jason london as court the 17 year old boy reese <UNK> is astonishingly good in her film debut displaying every emotion that a 14 year old girl feels in experiencing young love and hurt never striking a false note <UNK> and london are both equally good as well the film accurately depicts each <UNK> thoughts or feelings in regard to love with heartfelt sensitivity never crossing over into <UNK> excess even once kudos to the <UNK> screenplay from jenny <UNK> this is one of the very few films about young love that is honest and consistent in tone without being emotionally <UNK> or <UNK> the music is wonderfully simple <UNK> the tone and mood from scene to scene but never becoming <UNK> the beautiful cinematography is by famed horror director <UNK> francis who was in his 70's when this was shot tess <UNK> and sam <UNK> play the girls' parents with dead aim accuracy for 1957 caring strict and emotionally simple <UNK> <UNK> is good also as the boy's mother there are feelings to sort out lessons to learn and truths to face in this sweet natured film that packs an emotional <UNK> to date this is robert <UNK> last film this is one of the very best films of 1991 of 4 stars
<START> this movie feels like a film project as though the filmmakers picked out a cross section of society with no experience and got to work characters are kind of <UNK> and naive though despite this amateurish feel the movie is effective it's like a cross section of life with neighborhood kids trying to realize or <UNK> their honest sexual feelings being raised by a grand parent of course from that generation there is shame associated with sexuality this provides for some predictable but well done conflict probably most enjoyable was the way the main character grew a little bit in his romantic relationship realizing a greater depth to sexual feelings a good watch but nothing stirring
<START> i loved this excellent movie farrah fawcett played the part <UNK> and with good heart she plays a woman who is driven to extreme <UNK> to protect herself and her friends after she is attacked by a stranger after being rejected by the police she realizes she is on her own br br then one day when she at home alone the stranger breaks into her home and attacks her again not being about to call the police or get him out she is forced to <UNK> him in the eyes and <UNK> him in her <UNK> br br i think there is a need for a wake up call to the laws of the land they are too easy on these criminals it's time for more harsh <UNK>
<START> i now that these days some people <UNK> see a movie without movie <UNK> so much dogma lars von <UNK> brothers are changed what we expect in a movie perhaps <UNK> is no one more independent non american movie the movie take all movies resources and language to tell us a simple history about love and marriage but much more fully of views <UNK> and let you thinking and i'm sure you can't fell <UNK> any second of a long <UNK> minutes i <UNK> that don't have a single scene longer that 3 o 2 1 2 minutes
<START> jon voight plays a man named joe joe is <UNK> up by a haunting childhood he has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic <UNK> he <UNK> his job as a <UNK> and goes out to become a hustler for wealthy people he meets a <UNK> named ratso dustin hoffman and the two for a relationship they go out and work together in helping each other out they become thieves the two grow remarkably close and soon can't live without each other however there is something very important that ratso hasn't told joe and it could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together this is one of the greatest films ever made it is a heartbreaking and shattering portrait of too very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other their story is devastating to watch but is ultimately important for people to see it's one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street the difference is that this film is from their perspective their lives are shown to us and it's devastating to see the <UNK> in this film treat them like dirt especially if we at one time were one of those people however the film doesn't try to guilt trip you instead it shows you the rough side of the lifestyle of <UNK> it is not a pleasant and <UNK> lifestyle like many hollywood films portray it such as milk money and pretty woman the lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty gritty and ugly life and it's sad that people have <UNK> themselves like the character of joe in this film does what <UNK> me the most about this film was that it came out in 1969 and it has stood the test of time perfectly today's audiences will still find great meaning in this film and will still love it and <UNK> it just as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in 1969 the film was rated x but what i notice about this film is that the sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest realistic and effective way anybody who has had sex before will know how humorous awkward and scary as hell it can be and this film doesn't shy away from any of that the sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be movies that were x rated such as midnight cowboy a clockwork orange <UNK> last tango in paris and fritz the cat all seem remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get away with an r rating today the sex scenes in midnight cowboy will seem quite strong but they certainly aren't sexy they are not graphic but they are realistic and that's what people should keep in mind when they view this film the course language that is used in the film particularly the word <UNK> is used effectively and is not gratuitous the violence is very shocking to watch even today but again it is necessary to the plot to depict the world of a hustler i'm really glad to see that midnight cowboy is not dated and is still just as affecting as it was in 1969 if not more i can't recommend this classic enough and i do hope that it continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten br br pros br br jon voight and dustin hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to watch they have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from usual you'll forget who is playing them within minutes br br beautiful score br br not at all dated or campy like many films of that decade come off as today br br fantastic and fast editing job br br cons br br for mature audiences only br br the opening scenes are well done but they could be just a little stronger
<START> another channel 4 great <UNK> long before it's time compelling acting from phil davis and the rest of the cast sexy intelligent and funny i remember watching it at the time and even then asking around no one had really heard of it but trying to find someone now who can recall it is even harder perhaps channel 4 don't do their job well enough in <UNK> up the enthusiasm needed either that or the general public is too interested in the tv vomit that is big brother i suspect the latter <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> dark place <UNK> channel 4 to release a dvd of that series let's hope the same can happen with north square
<START> if you enjoy films like american pie road trip van wilder avoid this cinematic refuse at all costs it is an <UNK> mean spirited insipid waste of resources that should never have been discussed <UNK> much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting <UNK> easily the worst film i have seen in the past 18 months mind numbingly bad for the entire <UNK> minutes of it's runtime had it been much longer i would not have been able to write this review without using profanity consider yourself warned
<START> being a <UNK> new <UNK> i might be more critical than most in watching city hall but i have to say that before even getting to the story itself i was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of new york city that director harold <UNK> created br br for example there's a reference to <UNK> restaurant in brooklyn where political boss frank <UNK> likes to eat there is or was a <UNK> restaurant on <UNK> street in downtown brooklyn when i lived in new york back in 1996 it was in fact particularly <UNK> by political people in the <UNK> though they did have a couple of other <UNK> br br no surprise because the script was co <UNK> by nicholas <UNK> who still writes both political and organized crime stories he knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film br br a detective played by <UNK> <UNK> goes for an <UNK> meeting with a relative of mob boss anthony <UNK> and things <UNK> and three people wind up dead including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school the story <UNK> and at the end it's reached inside city hall itself br br al pacino plays mayor john <UNK> and john cusack is his deputy mayor a <UNK> <UNK> a state which has a tradition of <UNK> corruption itself he's the <UNK> here and in trying to do damage control cusack finds more than he <UNK> for br br danny aiello plays brooklyn political boss frank <UNK> and for those of you not from new york his character is based on the late <UNK> president of queens donald <UNK> who was also brought down by scandal he's very much the kind of brooklyn politician i knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and <UNK> done for them do aiello in br br city hall was the farewell performance on film for anthony <UNK> one of the most underrated and under appreciated talents ever on the screen no one watches anyone else whenever he's on br br al <UNK> best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself his is a complex part he's a decent enough man but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like new york br br for those who want to know about political life in the big apple city hall is highly recommended
<START> as we all know hollywood enjoys changing historical events around for our enjoyment and <UNK> minutes is one of those <UNK> movies for example the bank robbers never did go back in the bank when they started shooting at the <UNK> yet in the movie we see them go back inside twice another example is the number of <UNK> officers who were shot near the end of the movie this is far from the truth but of course hollywood must have a good bloody ending so they add some more blood and guts some events were combined and many of the lead actors played several different people but this is what hollywood has always done so why complain i guess the only sad part is that i have watched some one hour documentaries about the north hollywood shootout on <UNK> that were far better then this
<START> i find this movie very enjoyable the plot is simple and easily <UNK> the humour is light and clean and because the storyline involving mistaken identity is quite common i find myself looking forward to how this movie flesh this story out turns out to be very nice the performance of the female lead is admirable her portrayal of an innocent naive girl trying to <UNK> some white lies to david's sophisticated role was very charming i also find <UNK> dancing very very well done i find myself drawn to her <UNK> as she <UNK> about the stage effortlessly and <UNK> br br for those who have had enough of profanity filled movies of today you will enjoy this movie thoroughly
<START> i thought this movie was terrible i'm chinese so i thought everything was totally wrong many of the facts were incorrect the only thing right about chinese history in the movie was when <UNK> mother explained to her husband about the <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> i also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake many of the actors and actresses were not very great some of the jokes that were supposedly funny were really stupid i think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get disney has really got to get more information about chinese history if they want to create an <UNK> movie <UNK> was quite accurate watch this movie if you want to waste some time
<START> i was hoping this was going to be good as a fan of timothy <UNK> james bond and although it wasn't his deserved <UNK> bond <UNK> it was a laugh belushi brought some good humour to his part and dalton <UNK> it up nicely but was probably underused his part was liked a <UNK> up version of jack nicholson in a few good men the other brit in it was a bit shocking but <UNK> it was a laugh
<START> i just watched i q again tonight and had forgotten how much i love this movie it is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world i love the <UNK> to <UNK> all throughout from the opening with einstein playing <UNK> <UNK> little star on the <UNK> to him <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> during the iq testing of the ed <UNK> i love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career an especially unique situation for the 1950's the time in which this movie is set i myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children so please don't think i am some <UNK> women's <UNK> it's wonderful how a man who is only a grease monkey is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the message to me is that we are not what we do but who we are is defined by so much more no <UNK> there are so many little gags and one liners that are almost <UNK> if you don't watch and listen carefully br br i did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page in the scene when ed <UNK> is to speak at <UNK> there are 3 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc hanging on the right from the <UNK> <UNK> in the next camera shot there only 2 in the credits on our video it lists tony <UNK> character as bob <UNK> not bob <UNK> as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on imdb br br i highly recommend this movie it may be a piece of fluff in some <UNK> but has lots more substance than many give it credit for not only that what a great cast is assembled here watch it and enjoy
<START> but it's worth watching for boyer lorre and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that were filmed during the war either required <UNK> to american <UNK> as in this gun for hire or the use of american actors in roles where they did not fit bacall fits that part here i kept waiting for her to <UNK> and bring <UNK> to life her tone of voice is simply all wrong for an upper class <UNK> but listen to the dialogue no people don't talk that way except in books but greene was sending a message about an england that needed to wake up to the dangers of the world one other positive note <UNK> range of characters were kept whole while mr <UNK> <UNK> more a <UNK> at least his <UNK> was kept and his final conversation with <UNK> is priceless
<START> i have seen and liked the original film and expected more from a remake than this br br good effects and makeup are good no complaints about the score and visuals they are adequate and the performances were okay tim roth was excellent the other principals were fine and a handful of the supporting supporting actors did very well with extremely limited roles the action scenes were exciting and fun br br bad the escape from the ape city was terrible the characters are going in circles then suddenly <UNK> in the middle of town there are <UNK> to escape plus what escape route leads through everybody's bedroom br br the story was <UNK> down to include as much action as possible i like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect br br finally the ending was completely nonsensical as presented without seeing the inevitable sequel there is no justification for it br br
<START> the <UNK> 1991 the main character of the <UNK> played by eric <UNK> finds himself in a <UNK> center with some others similarly injured and there he must face an harsh new life confined to a wheelchair it's an interesting and promising premise but unfortunately it fails to <UNK> what ensues instead is largely hollywood <UNK> with some interesting moments certainly the cast eric <UNK> william forsythe wesley snipes et al is brilliant and perform well here as one would expect but their talents are wasted the characters are mainly stereotypes of one kind or another and most of them are thoroughly unlikeable the snipes character being the exception i suppose this is some kind of attempt to break through people's ideas about the handicapped being crippled or weak by depicting them for the most part as in your face <UNK> but it makes for an entirely annoying experience admittedly it will show you something of what those with permanent <UNK> go through in a way that is not <UNK> or <UNK> which is useful and a good idea but while the process being depicted can make one a difficult person to get along with and that's worth dealing with it is not part and <UNK> to that that these characters must be to varying degrees despicable they wouldn't have to be <UNK> either surely there's a middle ground somewhere by the film's conclusion the eric <UNK> character has come to accept his status as a handicapped person but since he is such a <UNK> <UNK> monster from the beginning of the film to the end we couldn't care less br br in addition to its character problems the film suffers from that weird syndrome that so many hollywood movies suffer from the syndrome doesn't really have an official name but you might call it inexplicable forgiveness syndrome it goes something like this characters abuse the crap out of each other and then without so much as an <UNK> all is forgiven an especially obnoxious example of this is in the movie the breakfast club in which one character spends most of the film <UNK> bullying everybody within <UNK> as a <UNK> love him in one of the the latest examples <UNK> 3 <UNK> the <UNK> lays waste to a <UNK> of manhattan then <UNK> on <UNK> for what seems like about 15 monotonous minutes before being <UNK> off with what amounts to bye now the most <UNK> example of <UNK> in the <UNK> is a sequence in which after being called the n word by william <UNK> racist biker character and his friends in the previous scene the wesley snipes character <UNK> it up with the same forsythe character in the next scene as if nothing had just happened just a short time hence again without so much as an oh yeah sorry about that business back there where i you know called you the n word it makes me wonder do these people actually watch these movies before they release them or do they just film them with their eyes closed kind of slap them together in the editing room according to scene number and call it a day's work
<START> i was looking forward to seeing this movie after reading a positive review in the new york times in addition i'm also <UNK> so there was more than just a passing interest in the subject matter however after watching it i was extremely disappointed br br the movie's pace was excruciatingly slow and monotonous the director <UNK> on certain scenes for much too long there was no passion or chemistry between the lovers there was barely any dialogue dialogue was sorely needed to compensate for the lack of acting at the end of the movie you didn't feel any compassion for the characters this movie was lacking in everything the script was weak the acting was poor and the editing was non existent the director tried to <UNK> certain noir film styles but failed miserably a good movie is one in which captures your attention maintains it and is successful in <UNK> without you feeling time has passed by this movie felt as though it would never end don't waste your money on this movie
<START> let's face it if you rented a <UNK> sequel of a forgotten 80's gem and expected it to be better than the aforementioned then you are an idiot <UNK> the dead code joins the long running list of unnecessary sequels that the dvd market has filled so easily movies like this don't need spoilers because you already know them br br the plot for this film is as follows nerd meets girl girl likes nerd nerd likes girl nerd gets accidentally involved with top secret government computer nerd and girl go to another country nerd and girl end up being <UNK> by government suits in the other country nerd and girl meet some important old guy that dies at key point in the film nerd and girl are captured the top secret government computer gets crazy nerd is hired to beat top secret government computer nerd beats top secret computer by using the same old top secret computer from the first <UNK> film nerd saves the day nerd gets laid br br the end br br the acting script effects score and cinematography are what you would expect b grade some familiar faces are in here and unless you are a mega fan of <UNK> <UNK> then you should avoid this one granted the movie won't make you insane enough to eat your own <UNK> by seeing it so if you like cheap looking <UNK> sequels then you are right at home br br sadly <UNK> <UNK> was too involved with some masterpiece that he couldn't even do a five second cameo in this one but can you blame him
<START> the first episode i saw of lost made me think i thought what is this some people who crashed and get chased by a giant monster but it's not like that it's far more than that because their is no monster at all and every episode that you see of lost well it's getting better every time a deserted island with an underground <UNK> and especially the connection between the people who crossed paths with each other before they crashed that's the real secret br br this series rules and i can't wait to know what's really going on there i hope that they don't air the last 2 episodes in the theaters this series deserves a 9 out of 10
<START> ok the box looks promising whoopi goldberg standing next to danny glover <UNK> the famous farmer and his wife painting then you pop this baby in the dvd player and all hope is lost in less then five minutes supposed to be a comedy and i must admit i did laugh once about ten minutes before the ending this movie has the following elements a <UNK> and abused next door neighbor a boring legal trial <UNK> talk of <UNK> and death and <UNK> hilarious huh no please if you never listen to anyone's reviews please do here you cannot even force yourself to watch this crap crap i said it crap whoever put there name on this should indeed sue
<START> i so wanted to believe in this movie after the only form of mainstream comedy this country <UNK> is slapstick and stereotypes br br of course it went completely the other way let's be cool and edgy and came out the other side with little to show for it i bet one small seed went nuts for this i know <UNK> did br br none of the main characters have the comedic chops to pull it off even danny k had better timing i'm actually being serious every time they introduced a bit character i kept thinking darn this person should have been the lead br br independent doesn't mean that the camera work needs to be horrible black and white did nothing for this movie actually with such flat dialogue it hurt this even more by bringing the boredom into sharp relief the black and white also wasn't crisp the composition was horrible the use of music was horrible strangely enough i watched little miss sunshine after this movie and the composition on that was superb maybe that's why the <UNK> in this movie stick out in my mind br br i think <UNK> who was funnier than the leads before he even said anything was speaking to this movie and not david see it and you'll understand i bet the guys who <UNK> <UNK> were <UNK> one would think nothing happens there at all i got the feeling it could have been filmed in someone's back garden i know regular guys who have much funnier <UNK> and <UNK> conversations than any of these comics the dude who they hooked up with end was ok though br br guess <UNK> <UNK> gonna stay in the stone age a little longer nice work guys
<START> after all these years of peter <UNK> brilliant <UNK> giving of his soul film after film at last hollywood <UNK> him an oscar recently br br country dance showed up one night late and of course blew me out of my <UNK> <UNK> in my alleged life how does he do it br br york again also is brilliant in this kind of play both psychological <UNK> loaded for bear br br bravo to author director cast and camera crew no wonder the <UNK> lost to these irish <UNK> english <UNK> brutal honesty hurts back in the 70's when i personally believed honesty was pure and absolutely vital to trust i have <UNK> my edgy extremes and will settle for more human warm flaws within myself and others br br forgiveness allows humanity to have a reverse gear and allows us to fix our own bull headed <UNK> and erotic mistakes
<START> no spoilers br br being a david lynch film one could have the idea that it depicts that enigmatic mind of his like the majority of his feature films do but it is a very straight story as the title might hint don't except to be caught in the usual <UNK> void of <UNK> that usually occurs after viewing i e lost highway it is a simple film but it is indeed a great film that is both from a innovative and an entertaining aspect it's innovative because it so not lynch but maybe that is lynch he likes to twist our minds and therefore puts together a film that might seem very mainstream and far from lynch himself being a very <UNK> director he might just make a film like this just to <UNK> his regular audience because he knows what they expect but he doesn't give it to them that would be <UNK> br br the pace of the film is slow i would almost say lawn <UNK> speed don't expect an action orgy but the film is truly entertaining for the ones who go with the flow of the film look carefully for those small details that lynch plot throughout the movie for our entertainment look for the great cinematography that makes this film come to life and listen to <UNK> score and the main theme that really <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> landscapes shown frequently br br farnsworth puts in one of his best performances in this film making him one of the most likeable ol' men ever depicted on film he doesn't have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts his <UNK> just shines right through him and his acting earned him an oscar nomination need i say that his weak health in this film wasn't acted he was <UNK> with cancer and shot himself right after this film was complete that knowledge just puts more emphasis on the film because it becomes more of a homage to farnsworth br br all of the above form a very nice motion picture that is suitable for all kinds of people that like a film the way they are supposed to be done one could ask for <UNK> that aren't that obvious and a bit naive but it doesn't ruin the overall picture being that it is a memorable motion picture 9 10
<START> a well <UNK> movie about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the wife of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> glenn fitzgerald who is deeply unhappy <UNK> brother <UNK> christopher <UNK> sees this and hires her to work in the field in which she's already an <UNK> he also starts an affair with her and then when she spends time with a puerto <UNK> artist he <UNK> her and betrays her to the family which <UNK> her out there's a subplot in which <UNK> dead brother talks to her and apparently takes the form of a magical <UNK> woman but why is not clear much is not clear unfortunately including what is going on with <UNK> why she tells the <UNK> there's a fire inside her and maybe it's not from god and what this means and what the magical <UNK> woman tells her means to an extent the story touches on the plight of women in the ultra <UNK> community and yet <UNK> is not exactly <UNK> nor is the notion of being redeemed by the love of a man of another race very well thought out the title comes from the biblical definition of the worth of a good <UNK> yet it's the bastard <UNK> who quotes it to <UNK> <UNK> struggles with the part she's supposed to be a jew from the mid west and sometimes her accent is flat and at other times it's taken on the characteristic sounds of brooklyn she's at her best when she's being tough and taking charge but ultimately the movie's a mess
<START> this is not the video <UNK> but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in britain it is 75 a rehash of the boogeyman and would have been banned for the same reason whatever that was br br i was initially confused as i thought that annie kelly <UNK> may have been a different <UNK> but she was someone trouble by psychic visions of a boogeyman similar to the one in the first film fans will immediately note that they are not the same person br br after seeing a murder in a bathroom and also seeing the address as well annie her psychiatrist and a <UNK> psychology student who greatly resembles the guy on the cheap romance novels and <UNK> commercials head to the house and sure enough it's the same bathroom 24 hours later a murder happens just as she described of course we have no idea who this <UNK> woman is or why she was murdered br br then the movie shift to a <UNK> of the boogeyman story with some extra footage that we did not see in the original notably the boogeyman is shown unlike the original sadly some of the good scenes were cut but 90 of it is there why <UNK> this film did they find the footage in the trash what was the purpose br br we'll never know and despite the psychologist telling annie she is <UNK> we all know the <UNK> will never die
<START> when i first watched this we borrowed it from our local library about a year ago and watched it about 3 times we've just watched it again and i liked it more than i did the last time i'd watched it br br the film is mainly about two dogs called charlie and itchy voiced by dom <UNK> and i love dom <UNK> charlie is half a gangster and half a <UNK> which i like itchy is his sidekick charlie is killed by his friend not and sent to heaven when charlie comes back to life it is the start of an amazing adventure br br the five main reasons why i'm absolutely crazy about this film one i love the characters except carface my favourite three are charlie itchy and a little girl called anne marie who comes slightly later two i love the period of history in which this film is set it is set during the <UNK> in the united states three the don <UNK> animation as usual is superb the backgrounds are good too four there is a strange excitement in this film that keeps me on the edge of my seat five the songs in this are lovely my favourite song starts with i need brazil the <UNK> the thrill br br so watch this lovely film when you can you won't be disappointed
<START> starring an unknown cast which seem likely to remain that way this film is yet another cheap slasher flick which <UNK> me how this was released i have no problem with horrors and slasher flicks in particular in fact they are my favourites but when they are done this bad it really does take the monkey and its no wonder the genre has such a hard time the story is as clichéd and without imagination as possible with a bunch of people in a cabin out in the woods being <UNK> and <UNK> up by this zombie ghost guy its not the story that sucks the most its the atrocious acting and <UNK> home made directing quality and an awful soundtrack not to mention laughable effects and some incredibly lazy film making these morons are outside in clear daylight yet we are meant to believe it's night what the hell was the director thinking with this move what he had only one day to film all this in he was scared of the dark is hilarious seeing a cop walking around in pure daylight with a torch acting as if its pitch black though br br i guess the positive side for the actors is they look like people who work in the local supermarket so at least they could possibly escape from this film without ever being noticed im sure one of the teens plays <UNK> down the local pub but she's 40 45 br br anyway good for a laugh but just another waste of film and time
<START> when i saw the elaborate dvd box for this and the dreadful red queen <UNK> i felt certain i was in for a big disappointment but surprise surprise i loved it convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles let alone take in the ridiculous explanation these <UNK> apart however the film is a dream fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful bruno <UNK> score he may not be <UNK> but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so really enjoyable with lots of colour plenty of <UNK> some gory kills and minimal police <UNK> super
<START> to overcome the death of his wife an old man does what anyone in his position would naturally do at least in a peter <UNK> movie he and his son <UNK> their home with eight and a half one has no legs women and <UNK> on a sexual odyssey this being a <UNK> film there is lots of pretentious and uninteresting <UNK> and of course there is unnecessary male nudity in fact the father and son share a bed sleeping in the nude gross besides who wants to see an old guy full frontal for those who are not into the <UNK> erotic scene one of the women likes to do the nasty with horses there is no story just a random collection of dull scenes
<START> i caught this cuban film at at an <UNK> film club it was shown shortly after the <UNK> <UNK> silly <UNK> cartoon where the <UNK> of <UNK> is <UNK> with the <UNK> of jazz what with the recently deceased <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> through <UNK> in this old cinema ballroom and a cuban flag hanging from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the scene was set for a <UNK> celebration of engaged filmmaking and <UNK> <UNK> at the <UNK> of <UNK> burton but then the film started and the <UNK> <UNK> paint gradually became more interesting than the shoddy mess on screen br br the storyline of <UNK> <UNK> promises much carla is a bored <UNK> <UNK> at a cuban post office her only escape from an altogether <UNK> existence is to <UNK> letters and rewrite them <UNK> basic <UNK> <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> of breathless emotion cue numerous shots of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with joy grief pity terror and the like br br the problem is that the simplicity of the narrative is marred by endless <UNK> into film school <UNK> latino caricature marx brothers slapstick and even during a particularly <UNK> editing trick the celluloid scratching of a <UNK> <UNK> onto a character's face br br <UNK> characters abound <UNK> the boss at the post office is a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> her boss eyed <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> points fingers <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> and romantic interest reveals hidden writing talent when carla <UNK> for miami a chase scene in oh so hilarious fast forward is thrown in for good measure all this would be fine in a <UNK> and <UNK> comic strip but in a black and white zero fx flick with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> attempts to <UNK> the <UNK> somewhere between the <UNK> heroine <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and the <UNK> as great <UNK> theme of <UNK> <UNK> like <UNK> its protagonist is an eccentric single white female who <UNK> impending <UNK> by trying to bring magic into the lives of strangers and like <UNK> <UNK> the film does not <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> of poetry and a <UNK> on a <UNK> takes a romantic lead unfortunately <UNK> <UNK> fails to capture the <UNK> and <UNK> of either film br br there are two things that might merit watching this film in a late night tv <UNK> the first is the opening <UNK> shot of carla on a <UNK> <UNK> floor which cuts to the <UNK> puzzle she is working on the second is to see <UNK> <UNK> as a <UNK> example our post <UNK> <UNK> social club obsession with cuban artistic <UNK> can often <UNK> us into accepting any <UNK> that features a <UNK> on the soundtrack this film should not have <UNK> a global release films such as waiting list and <UNK> cover similar <UNK> territory far more successfully
<START> this film is probably the worst film that i have ever seen i'm studying french at college and thus understood all the dialog so the language <UNK> wasn't an issue i must say it is really hard to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the movie there is only one professional actor in the cast and i'm guessing no professional directors or writers br br although i have rated it 1 out of 10 it probably doesn't merit such a poor rating this is merely a <UNK> effort of <UNK> its current overall rating of 7 3 to something more realistic perhaps 4 3 would be a more accurate rating because the film is a true non event 100 minutes or so in length that you will never get back br br the real shame is that i am sure some college student is <UNK> his nut making a film twice as good and half the length however if you want to join the <UNK> which seems to be rolling around imdb you might as well go ahead give lost in translation a 10 as well
<START> this is the columbo that got directed by steven spielberg at an early point in his career it's nothing sensational but some small hint of great things to come for spielberg can be seen in this movie the movie is basically in the same style as most of <UNK> <UNK> movies and tv works so that means that some characters tend to show some <UNK> and no i'm not just talking about the columbo character alone the kind of character <UNK> which perhaps can be best seen in the 1975 spielberg movie jaws but other than some small hints of typical early spielberg elements you can't call this movie the work of and fine example of a rising director star not that its bad of course it isn't but as i said earlier it also isn't anything too sensational br br this movie began really well and very promising but after it's fine opening in which as always the murder occurred the movie became sort of more slow and also dull to watch dull because it's mostly a columbo movie by the book that doesn't have real memorable moments in it not dull because it's a boring movie to watch br br the murder itself was quite ingenious and the concept of having a crime story writer murdering his writing partner showed some great and interesting potential the story however didn't really explored all of its possibilities at least that's the feeling this movie left me with br br the movie was still a good one to watch nevertheless thanks to the character of jack cassidy who thinks he's smarter then columbo due to his mystery crime writing experience and tries to give him all kinds of possible hints leading away from himself but of course columbo knows better and he is his number one suspect from the first moment on but he as usual plays the game along br br the movie does have a good overall style and uses some fine camera position and editing funny to see that also most of this was all mostly consistent with spielberg's later work especially some of the camera angles br br a fine and perfectly watchable columbo movie but don't let the name of spielberg attached to it rise your expectations for it too highly br br 7 10
<START> i should have known when i looked at the box in the video store and saw lisa <UNK> to me she's the female ernie hudson a k a le kiss of death for any movie its almost guaranteed the movie will be bad e g <UNK> if hudson is in it with the exception of the <UNK> films which were intentionally campy and bad despite my instincts and the fact that i just saw civil brand yet another cinematic tour de force starring lisa <UNK> i rented it anyway after all i ignored my hudson instinct on oz and ended up watching a very quality series so i figured i'd give this movie a chance br br if you are a lover of bad movies this is a definite must see this has got to be the most unintentionally funny movie i've seen in a <UNK> time the plot is fairly straightforward <UNK> monica <UNK> sister is killed by a band of <UNK> led by bobby brown and like many an action movie before this she <UNK> on her guns one last time and <UNK> to avenge her sisters death to do this she <UNK> the titular gang of <UNK> supposedly based on a true story of a female gang and they go out and exact revenge and along the way there's some subplot or something or other about some gold that might be buried in the town one nice thing i will say about this movie is that from what i could tell the stars did their own riding and they looked great <UNK> br br the funniest <UNK> unintentionally funny scenes look for when they introduce <UNK> <UNK> character or when <UNK> character <UNK> her <UNK> not to <UNK> on her guns <UNK> with a <UNK> <UNK> cry to the heavens or <UNK> <UNK> character joking with lisa <UNK> character or <UNK> <UNK> character being killed or <UNK> <UNK> character convincing lisa <UNK> character to <UNK> the gang or the asian chick or macy <UNK> character talking bout the debt is paid etc with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> and bobby <UNK> left eye i can't even remember the names of the other characters <UNK> i was laughing so hard when they were introduced br br if the director had gone for parody and broad comedy this would have been a great movie unfortunately he tries to take it seriously seemingly without first taking exposition sound design in his defense hip hop is <UNK> difficult to work into a period piece set design script writing nor period historical research was it me or were these the <UNK> people with the <UNK> teeth in the old west seriously usually when i see a movie that's not so good i ask myself could you have done any better this is the first time in a long time where the answer is an <UNK> yes
<START> anthony <UNK> has adapted his play via satellite and directed the best comedic film to come out of new zealand for a long time <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a drop out she hasn't achieved much in her latter years and has grown <UNK> of her family since her father's <UNK> confession her twin sister carol also portrayed by <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> in the media <UNK> as she represents new zealand in swimming at the <UNK> a middle aged <UNK> and desperate director brian <UNK> and his good natured cameraman who is also <UNK> one night stand from the night previous paul karl urban film the <UNK> family's <UNK> moment watching carol swim to victory this wouldn't be so bad but <UNK> family is the epitome of embarrassing first of all there is the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> donna <UNK> she makes fairy <UNK> and cocktail <UNK> for the all important film crew and refuses to change the way she is her oldest daughter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is desperate to be something more than common she has a nice home with bedroom walls painted <UNK> <UNK> expensive tastes and a nasty <UNK> attitude to match she is also <UNK> 40 and <UNK> for a child her husband ken tim <UNK> is an <UNK> and forces himself on jobs that don't need doing as well as doing jobs that need to be done ie <UNK> the middle daughter <UNK> jodie <UNK> who won best supporting actress at new zealand film awards for this portrayal is a knocked up <UNK> who has a dubious history with ken both older sisters clash the mother is in a state ken is as bad a <UNK> tim taylor carol is <UNK> her olympic desire and <UNK> is aware all of this is to be <UNK> on national tv why shouldn't she be embarrassed it is great to see some famous new zealand faces perform in the suburban comedy that has witty lines to spare i loved the <UNK> between <UNK> and <UNK> one is like an adult <UNK> my <UNK> clock is <UNK> away the other a <UNK> tramp who has what her sister desires a <UNK> in the <UNK> climax of the film is quite sentimental and is nicely done the performances are a treat and the film works perfectly a great way to spend an hour and a half br br
<START> this is undeniably the scariest game i've ever played it's not the average shoot everything that moves kind of <UNK> which i usually don't care much for but the acceptable <UNK> interesting weapons and magic great surround <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and above all incredible atmosphere i love the <UNK> which <UNK> you at certain places in the games to see or hear events that happened there in the past the only game i've had to take regular breaks after a few minutes of playing just because of the intensity of the atmosphere i'm a great horror fan <UNK> of clive <UNK> stories and movies and <UNK> in a horror story like this makes me <UNK> for more games that <UNK> atmosphere and a more involving story 9 10 1 because i'm no <UNK> fan and perhaps the game was a bit short
<START> joan fontaine is a damsel in distress in this <UNK> musical starring fred astaire george burns and <UNK> allen the plot what there is of it is about a british woman fontaine in love with an american who is mistaken for astaire a musical comedy star br br the film directed by george stevens contains some wonderful gershwin music including nice work if you can get it and a <UNK> day the best scene is the stiff upper lip number which takes place in a fun house br br <UNK> singing voice sounds more <UNK> in this film than it does in others and he has a couple of excellent dance numbers burns plays his over the top <UNK> and allen is <UNK> secretary she's hilarious the problem as others have pointed out is fontaine who has to dance with astaire at the end of the film stevens could easily have used a double because he shows the dance in a long shot and it takes place among the trees i would have thought it was a double except the dancing was so lousy br br definitely worth seeing despite its flaws
<START> ok so i don't watch too many horror movies and the reason is films like <UNK> <UNK> i caught this on a surprisingly feature filled dvd and it scared me silly in fact the only extra i think the dvd was missing was a pair of new pants br br however the next day i was telling someone about it when i realised i'd only really seen about 10 of it the rest of the time i'd been watching the pizza on my coffee table nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if i actually covered my eyes the few times i did brave watching the screen i jumped so hard that i decided not to look up again br br the film making is solid and the characters' situation was really compelling the simplicity of the film is what really captured my jump button it's merely a <UNK> a cabin and a <UNK> jail and a lot of darkness most surprising to me was the fact that while this was clearly not a multi million dollar production the make up effects really looked like it was also it's obvious this is a film made by someone with a great love of film making the sound design and the music really made use of my surround system like many hollywood movies have never done i noticed on line that this film won the la <UNK> a really major achievement and i guess that the festival had seen the <UNK> clear talent and probably a great deal more of this movie than i managed to br br turn up the sound turn off the lights and if you want to keep your girlfriend order a pizza
<START> this is an ok film but lacks any real depth either emotionally or in terms of story telling br br the story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none also no real suspense br br washington is believable in the lead but he is sleep walking through it there is no scope to <UNK> any acting <UNK> for him or the supporting cast br br the story simply falls a little flat even having never heard of the title character the ending was obvious but unlike other films about such <UNK> this one has no emotional impact you don't really care about him and the motivations of those on the outside helping seem more academic than concerned for his <UNK> br br there is an attempt to <UNK> some emotion using the boy outside who hero <UNK> carter but this seems forced br br it's an ok film but instantly forgettable
<START> <UNK> the <UNK> lives on the <UNK> of french society in a life without meaning purpose or direction br br i watched this because of all the stellar reviews but i'm afraid i must have missed something the character of <UNK> has little or no personality while <UNK> through life being rude to people getting high and <UNK> nothing to anyone's life she's not interesting or exciting she's just useless br br i've seen and known enough people like that there is no secret meaning to what they're doing they are just lazy <UNK> i wouldn't want <UNK> anywhere near me as she tends to steal anything that isn't nailed down and leave her friends in the <UNK> sure she's enigmatic because there isn't anything to her lots of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i've seen are enigmatic i wouldn't want to see a film about them either br br possibly there is something there that i totally missed otherwise i'm assuming that all the reviews are from people who assume anything done by a french female director is high art
<START> while the premise behind the house where evil <UNK> may be intriguing the execution is downright pathetic i'm not even sure where to begin as i've got so many problems with this movie i suppose i'll just number a few of them br br 1 the acting  when you see that edward albert doug <UNK> and susan george and her teeth are the stars of your movie you know you're in trouble not that it matters much to me but these are hardly a list names susan george may have been in a couple of movies i enjoy but i've never considered her the greatest actress i've ever seen and in this movie her acting is embarrassing as for the other two the less said the better br br 2 the ghosts  the ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them reminded me quite a bit of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disney world and they are about as frightening and why did they have to be so obvious subtlety is not a characteristic of the house where evil <UNK> br br 3 the plot  how predictable can one movie be the outcome of this movie is painfully obvious once you meet the three main characters if you couldn't see where this movie was headed after about 15 minutes you need to see more movies br br 4 the convenient priest  what are the chances that the haunted house you buy just happens to be across the street from a group of japanese monks not to mention that one of them knows the history of your house and comes over knocks on the door and asks if you need help <UNK> evil spirits absurd is a word that comes to mind br br 5 everything else  it's very difficult for me to think of any <UNK> to write about i suppose i'll give it a point for the opening scene and a point for the <UNK> architecture that's a sure sign of a winner  noting the architecture as a highlight of any film doesn't say much about the actual movie br br i'll stop you should be able to get the idea from what i've already mentioned and i haven't even mentioned the annoying little girl or the invasion of the <UNK> or a <UNK> of other problems be warned this thing is horrible
<START> <UNK> boy this was a real trial to get through the dvd case has tom <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> on it and that is the only reason that anybody would buy it he looks about forty on the box however the movie was made in 1982 so he still has his <UNK> buddies <UNK> and of course is about forty pounds lighter the plot concerns a <UNK> and dragons like game that hanks and his three friends play and hanks ends up thinking the whole thing is real chris <UNK> is a boy genius named jay jay and the best thing about the movie is that he wears a succession of funny hats <UNK> look he has a yellow <UNK> on with a <UNK> now he's dressed like a wwi pilot this was a truly awful movie but in a bad way a bunch of vets pop up mostly as parents of the kids there's anne i'm honey west <UNK> francis and louise <UNK> who actually looks kind of hot murray hamilton the mayor from jaws has a <UNK> roll as a cop wendy <UNK> is the love interest for hanks and some blonde guy i have never seen before or since there is some <UNK> music here and there and absolutely no tension or sense of danger or excitement there is a monster that only hanks can see because he's you know nuts the monster is played by the late great kevin peter hall he of predator fame a friend of mine got this out of the ol' <UNK> bin at <UNK> and advised me to chuck it in the trash without even looking at it so naturally i had to see if it was as bad as all that it was the night before i watched apollo 13 so after that this movie was a bit of a shock do yourself a favor and leave it in the bin oh yeah after hanks almost jumps from one of the world trade center towers because of his <UNK> he goes home to <UNK> and is visited by his friends hanks mother a drunken vera miles says he is coming along nicely now but when they walk down to the lake to visit him in his <UNK> outfit he is <UNK> than ever the end
<START> this has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made the plot looked intriguing like that of passenger <UNK> but with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better the plot has been worked out in the worst possible way just a few of the awful moments in the movie a flight attendant is standing in the opened <UNK> of a flying <UNK> and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at <UNK> feet thats impossible even for <UNK> pilots with thousands of hour experience when on the <UNK> perfectly straight of course she is <UNK> to pull on the <UNK> huh come on <UNK> are there to ensure lift at low <UNK> when on the <UNK> you use thrust reverse on the <UNK> and give maximum power i can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie but then my <UNK> would become the size of the english <UNK> this is a movie you want to miss take my word for it
<START> poor ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to italy tired of the hollywood <UNK> treatment first it was suffering the <UNK> of a <UNK> island in <UNK> an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less <UNK> actress and now it's europa <UNK> another tedious exercise in <UNK> sentiment br br nor does the story do much for alexander knox in another <UNK> role as her long suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the <UNK> death of their young son at least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than <UNK> br br bergman is still attractive here but moving toward a more <UNK> appearance as a rich society woman she's never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son despite attempts by a kindly male friend sometimes i think i'm going out of my mind she tells her husband a <UNK> statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace but it does give us a sense of where the story is going br br bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post war rome but being a social worker with poor children doesn't improve her emotional health and from <UNK> the plot takes a turn for the worse br br the film's overall effect is that it's not <UNK> interesting to make into a project for a major star like bergman the film loses pace <UNK> through the story as bergman becomes more and more <UNK> and her husband suspects that she's two timing him the story goes downhill from there after she <UNK> a street walker through her <UNK> illness the final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylum br br ingrid suffers <UNK> through it all over <UNK> for the loss of her son but it's no use not one of her best flicks to put it mildly br br trivia note if she wanted neo realism with mental illness she might have been better off accepting the lead in the snake pit when it was offered to her by director <UNK> <UNK> it would have done more for her career than europa <UNK> br br <UNK> up another bleak <UNK> of <UNK> and bergman
<START> im going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you this movie is awesome from beginning to end it is filled with genuine thrills the fight scenes are fantastic the chase scenes are enthralling and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained but that is only because everything that <UNK> it damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor daring you not to believe him in this role he is this role a welcome addition to the series in david <UNK> hope i spelled that close to right as a seedy cia agent out to kill bourne this is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way some things toward the end are just a <UNK> preposterous thus <UNK> a 10 rating the ending is left open for sequels and i sure hope that they consider doing more of these for none have been bad excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy br br p s the shaky <UNK> did not hurt any of the action but i still think we could do without it the good news is you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action
<START> this movie is horrible but you have to see it because of that i'm not here to discuss the entire film just the greatest chase scene ever when eddie <UNK> milk on tim he gets chased down the <UNK> eddie puts obstacles in the <UNK> way with hilarious consequences like a <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> player buy the dvd and watch it slow the best <UNK> is a knocked over <UNK> bucket which one jock jumps over but proceeds to slide on the ground out a door but when he <UNK> he picks up speed thus <UNK> physics mainly <UNK> yet what lies behind the door is supreme the <UNK> <UNK> case in any school ever which this jock proceeds to clear in the air in reality he probably would die of a broken neck not only does he defy all concepts of reality he makes the funniest noise ever made in that situation go and buy this one trust me this scene is worth your 6 bucks
<START> hello dave burning paradise is a film for anyone who likes jackie chan and indiana jones the films main protagonist is most definitely the bastard son of these two strange fathers as for the other characters well they are familiar <UNK> of similar action film stereotypes where this film is original is in the <UNK> of the traditional hong kong movie style with the hollywood action adventure sadly this has not been true of the films he has made in hollywood
<START> okay i <UNK> to set aside the fact that in selling <UNK> as real the movie was basically lying to me from the get go i <UNK> that hell i don't believe in vampires but i still liked dracula so i could live with this br br however even with that accepted the movie is just not very good it's competently made and acted but it doesn't really capture you at all there are several jump moments and i just looked at them and thought yeah i didn't expect that without actually jumping in the slightest br br also the resolution doesn't make sense if the force behind this is capable of doing the things it seems to be then why the hell does it need to use a <UNK> plus the end <UNK> was absurd they obviously put it there as part of the give the movie credibility by claiming it's all real thing but for that to work it really needs to be at the start but they can't put it at the start because then they give the plot away sticking it in at the end just made it stick out like a sore thumb
<START> an excellent example of cowboy noir as it's been called in which unemployed michael nicolas cage loses out on a job because he insists on being honest he's got a bum leg with really nothing else he can do he decides that for once he's going to lie when he walks into a bar and the owner wayne the late great j t walsh mistakes him for a hit man whom wayne has hired to do in his sexy young wife suzanne lara flynn boyle in fine form michael plays along and accepts <UNK> money then he goes to suzanne and informs her of her <UNK> intentions and accepts her money to get rid of wayne if that didn't <UNK> things enough the real hit man <UNK> from dallas dennis hopper in a perfect role for him shows up and michael is in even more trouble than before br br red rock west gets a lot out of the locations director john <UNK> who co wrote the script with his brother rick was smart in realizing the potential of a story set in a truly isolated small town that may have seen better days and in which the residents could be involved in any manner of schemes it's also an amusing idea of the kind of trouble an honest person could get into if they decided to abandon their principles and give in to any level of temptation it's an <UNK> dark and twist laden story with an assortment of main characters that are if not corrupt have at least been morally <UNK> like michael the lighting by cinematographer marc <UNK> is superb in its <UNK> even the climax set in a graveyard lends a nice morbid quality to the whole thing even if the writing isn't particularly logical or credible the film has a nice way of intriguing the viewer and just drawing them right in br br cage does a good job in the lead but his co stars have a grand old time sinking their teeth into their <UNK> and greed motivated characters hopper boyle and walsh are all fun to watch in these parts timothy <UNK> and dan <UNK> are fine as <UNK> <UNK> in one especially good twist walsh is also the local sheriff and there's an entertaining cameo role for country western star dwight <UNK> who also <UNK> the film with an enjoyable end credits tune br br it's quite a good little film worth checking out it moves forward at an impressive pace and if nothing else is certainly never boring br br 8 10
<START> i have watched this movie three times the last time i kept skipping around confusing scenes to find resolution for the plot perhaps the plot is not intended to hang together <UNK> or perhaps these rough spots are in the plot because <UNK> recall of distant events is rather <UNK> br br take the young ann grant claire danes here is a young woman who has attended an <UNK> college with the <UNK> of a rich family she must have had help to afford this very expensive education but never seems to have any family ties at all she never seems to have any relatives she can turn to when the consequences of one of her disastrous decisions take effect br br ann shares an evening of passion with her great love harris <UNK> patrick wilson then when harris <UNK> <UNK> after the tragic death of her brother buddy ann suddenly finds him repulsive and is disgusted with her own behavior i must have missed something significant here <UNK> behavior seems totally inexplicable ann <UNK> her relationship with harris and eventually marries one of the <UNK> at <UNK> wedding despite <UNK> <UNK> of harris she continues to hold deep feelings for him on her <UNK> br br it was obvious from his behavior that harris was deeply smitten with ann and would have gladly married her a scene showing their chance meeting years after <UNK> wedding showed that harris still had deep feelings for ann br br the film showed a pattern for <UNK> romantic relationships she always had a falling out with her men and she rejected them this pattern held with harris and two husbands in contrast <UNK> married a man she did not love and she remained with her husband until he died perhaps <UNK> was able to build a relationship because she refused to let her marriage fail br br then came the too convenient <UNK> of <UNK> ross at <UNK> <UNK> apparently <UNK> nurse was able to <UNK> enough information from <UNK> last few <UNK> moments to identify and contact <UNK> none of this communication appeared on the film br br i kept wondering about the house ann was living in during her final days how did she afford to buy such a house on the <UNK> <UNK> of her singing career ann always seemed one step ahead of financial disaster while raising her two daughters br br on another level i enjoyed the film's setting and music immensely the <UNK> mansion was just so <UNK> beautiful claire danes was <UNK> as the young ann grant she is really quite a talented singer i much prefer her natural brunette to the bottle blonde look she had in the film extras if only those <UNK> cgi <UNK> would go away i could raise the movie a whole point in my vote
<START> the movie was a long <UNK> release which where a bit disappointing because of the <UNK> i had set up when looking at it again i must say it is actually pretty ok first of all is it very true to the original history of course not completely and is as such only made to keep the right for the movie <UNK> history as a child is shown and is very true to the original the acting is perhaps not the best around and the plot is a bit thin but when you compare it to the 1966 <UNK> movie is way better just because it is not trying to be a musical generally would i only recommend it to fans of modesty blaise or to someone who by catch it on the tv
<START> the <UNK> the drama the better the film of sister rivalry this little gem was mainly promoted as a comedy upon its release in sweden so i'm glad to find that wasn't the whole case funny bits on small town <UNK> are there to enjoy surely but the drama takes center stage as the story progresses and not just family drama it also raises poignant questions on <UNK> differences of <UNK> lifestyle choices br br great character ensemble with many superb and moving dramatic scenes that score credibility points and they're not just <UNK> but hold everything in place it just makes me assume that if <UNK> bergman had made this the drama would suit him the international attention probably would have been immediate br br 7 out of 10 from <UNK>
<START> i claim no matter how hard i seek i'll never find a better movie version of othello if you love kenneth branagh's magnificent masterpieces much <UNK> about nothing 1993 and hamlet 1996 as much as i do i'm dead certain you'll also find oliver <UNK> othello irresistible laurence fishburne has been in a various splendid roles during his career he was quite terrific in boys n the hood 1991 i've always considered his amusing role of furious styles as his very greatest achievement that was of course way before i saw this br br he plays the part of othello and he is probably in the most challenging role of his whole career but he does a brilliant fantastic job <UNK> <UNK> is absolutely charming <UNK> and kenneth branagh is just simply phenomenal in a most fascinating role of the story's crooked manipulate villain <UNK> marvelous othello is part of the absolute elite among shakespeare's ingenious works it deals with his favorite topics <UNK> envy <UNK> and jealousy this movie adaptation is certainly one of the finest films i've seen that's based on william shakespeare's plays
<START> well there you have it another <UNK> on my account two actually first of all even though i like to think of myself that i know a little something about 70's euro exploitation and its most prolific <UNK> i never heard about joseph w <UNK> before here's a guy who made over <UNK> <UNK> and cult laden exploitation movies and i haven't seen a single one how why what happened here secondly and even worse just when you think to have found a new source for obscure cult movies that director's most famous and supposed masterpiece turns out to be an <UNK> dull and irritating film admittedly lesbian vampire movies form a pretty insignificant sub genre as a whole but some of them bath in ominous atmosphere and curious <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or harry <UNK> daughters of darkness joseph <UNK> film has nothing to offer except <UNK> amounts of gratuitous nudity and even that becomes boring rather quickly the events take place in a secluded old castle hidden deep in the german mountains where five centuries ago lived a <UNK> and <UNK> literally <UNK> her loyal <UNK> still throw naked dance parties in the <UNK> <UNK> which are lit by penis shaped <UNK> and hope to <UNK> the <UNK> any time soon now suddenly don't even ask how the castle is full of young and sexy female guests so even more erotic <UNK> ensue sounds delicious and entertaining enough but the devil's <UNK> contains a massive number of sequences where literally nothing happens and where the cast <UNK> ignorant facial expressions are simply <UNK> <UNK> isn't capable of creating suspense or building a gothic atmosphere or maybe he just didn't bother to and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> themselves to standing in front the camera topless and pull a really pathetic face please do yourself a favor no matter how desperately you <UNK> to see all lurid lesbian vampire movies of the 70's this one isn't worth a penny even the <UNK> of jess franco and jean <UNK> are pure art compared to this dud
<START> if there was a scale below 1 it would get a 10 following in the footsteps of <UNK> the acting if there was such a thing was atrocious the plot in <UNK> and <UNK> russo was <UNK> sweet in her role enough to make a person <UNK> ten thumbs down for a dumb movie saving grace kudos for era <UNK>
<START> despite a tight narrative <UNK> <UNK> election feels at times like it was once a longer picture with many characters and plot <UNK> abandoned or ultimately <UNK> some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel election 2 harmony is a virtue but it's still a <UNK> enthralling thriller about a <UNK> <UNK> election that <UNK> the usual <UNK> and explosions though not the violence in favour of constantly shifting <UNK> that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call it's also a film where the most ruthless character isn't always the most threatening one as the chilling ending makes only too clear one can imagine a lifetime of psychological <UNK> being necessary for all the trauma that one <UNK> on one unfortunate <UNK> br br simon <UNK> all too often a <UNK> actor but always at his best under <UNK> direction has possibly never been better in the lead not least because tony <UNK> much more <UNK> performance makes his <UNK> more the powerful
<START> the idea of making a miniseries about the berlin <UNK> seemed to me as one of the more interesting german post war movies it is a theme that has not been explored much as yet however the makers of this series stuffed it with clichés it starts already with the dvd cover of the movie which is a direct copy of the cover of <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gets to hear that her husband who is a doctor <UNK> <UNK> has died in russia and after the war she's struggling to survive she finds a job at the american base gets to work for the coolest and highest <UNK> officer <UNK> <UNK> in town falls in love with <UNK> gets pregnant and all of a sudden her husband turns up again come on we've seen this once too often <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> play their role quite well <UNK> <UNK> however never really seems to convince for some reason it always seems she's somewhat too late in giving the right emotional reaction to the scenes it just didn't work for me br br the action scenes with the planes and the air lift we're sometimes exciting more often not nasty things always seemed to happen to the same pilot br br unless you're a big fan of wwii movies i suggest you spend your money on something else chocolate ice cream brings a lot more satisfaction br br 4 out 10
<START> i wouldn't say this is a bad movie in fact it's pretty typical of the type of film that the poverty row studios were releasing at the time filmed for <UNK> bela lugosi is very effective in his role as the somewhat demented doctor scientist <UNK> as a respected member of the community in this movie bela and his henchmen have the nasty habit of stealing young brides and after their demise <UNK> <UNK> wife with a serum taken from their bodies in order to keep her young lugosi is more than up to the task in making this an enjoyable film however the movie suffers from the ultra wooden acting of co stars <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> coffin coffin nice name for a guy in a horror flick is especially bad in this case i've seen him in numerous movies and tv shows and he is always the same stiff wooden and utterly unconvincing miss <UNK> is only slightly better but she too lacks the acting talent to make her role believable still the viewer can enjoy the great lugosi act out yet another <UNK> scheme only to be <UNK> in the end despite the poor acting by some the corpse <UNK> is an enjoyable movie for all to see
<START> there's been a <UNK> of recent surfing movies that i seem to <UNK> run across without advance warning i caught this treasure on digital cable this week and what a pleasant surprise it was the focus is on the <UNK> of big wave surfing from the 60's greg <UNK> to our current <UNK> hamilton from <UNK> bay to <UNK> to jaws hell i could watch a movie just about <UNK> hamilton one of this <UNK> great <UNK> so the rest is just <UNK> there's loads of good surfing mixed in with interviews of past and present surfing stars in pleasant relaxed and <UNK> fashion of all the surfing movies i've seen this tells the big wave story the best and i think it's my favorite enjoy
<START> admirably odd though mean spirited comedy drama about a strange young man who hopes to fly like a bird through the <UNK> <UNK> robert altman directed quasi comedy with eccentric characters is so <UNK> with <UNK> that it starts to <UNK> early on from the weight some of the cinematography is <UNK> shelley duvall is a <UNK> in her debut as a tour guide and sally <UNK> looks every inch the <UNK> as bud <UNK> vision of a mother bird imagine altman and producer lou <UNK> explaining that role to her in the lead bud <UNK> is once again after harold <UNK> a true original not off putting like say michael j <UNK> <UNK> manages to be geeky wacky and <UNK> a tough act to pull off unfortunately this is one of altman's <UNK> he can put together a cast and a <UNK> like no one else but let him get fired up with some misguided inspiration and he <UNK> <UNK> from
<START> i saw this movie when it first came out it was an official selection for the <UNK> valley international film festival and i voted for it for best picture br br <UNK> <UNK> is hot as the psychotic but complex amanda this is not your ordinary psycho movie lots of interesting and original <UNK> on the genre sort of a fatal attraction for the younger set with some great blues music mixed in as the object of <UNK> affection is married to an up and coming blues singer who has less time for her husband as her career takes off br br
<START> was this based on a comic book a video game a drawing by a 3 year old br br there is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all not the characters not the dialog not the plot not the action nothing we have high tech international terrorists criminals who <UNK> like pre school kids <UNK> man of steel type <UNK> towards ice cold weather dialog so dumb that it's sometimes almost hilarious and so on even the <UNK> that the bad guys use is dumb tango tango a film that entertains through some suspense good action sequences and a nice snowy <UNK> setting oh yes and the unintentional humour br br the film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a <UNK> time then comes a sweat inducing failed rescue part which should make anyone with fear of heights problems want to pull their hair out and then we have some more bad dialog and after that some more great action this is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell br br <UNK> melodramatic exchange with turner when they meet after a long time is so <UNK> so clichéd so fake and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self <UNK> viewer soon after this display of awful dialog writing we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot <UNK> of an airplane the entire action is one big absurdity but it's mindless fun at its best although the rest of the action is exciting and fun the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film after the landing our master criminals seek for a guide and end up with stallone and <UNK> they send stallone to <UNK> the first case of money but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it they take most of his clothes off so he can freeze and they won't give him the equipment he needs so he can fall off do these gangsters want their money fetched or not very silly apparently they don't trust stallone but surely they know that they can always black mail him by using <UNK> as a hostage nevertheless our gangsters make <UNK> climb difficult if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are <UNK> there be any doubts and for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are they <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> in a truly evil manner everyone convinced good you'd better be otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children just to make sure that the <UNK> of the bad guys is crystal clear to everyone br br the old guy who flies the <UNK> how the hell did he fall for the trap firstly he must have been warned by the mtv <UNK> about the criminals and secondly he must have heard <UNK> and <UNK> voices on the <UNK> <UNK> a whole bunch of idiotic verbal <UNK> take place with <UNK> having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines get off my back <UNK> i haven't even started climbing on your back or <UNK> to stallone we had a deal but now we only have each other and as for <UNK> gang of murderers these guys never seem to want to kill immediately they are very creative about it they <UNK> pretend that they are playing football with your body and so on br br stallone co wrote this thing i have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it i'd hate to think the script is this bad because of a low i q
<START> this version of bleak house is the best adaptation of a classic novel known to me the representation of the court of <UNK> as a <UNK> in the drama is magnificent the acting is marvellous from the sinister <UNK> to the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> miss <UNK> and the two young lovers but it is the <UNK> web of <UNK> that holds the whole thing together and the cinematography is superb what mistake did the bbc make about <UNK> that meant that this version could not be seen in the uk on either video or dvd for many years i tried to find out from them but faced a stone wall in the end i got a dvd copy from canada
<START> this is a sad movie about this woman who thought her ex who she loved so much was probably dead but really his scientist dad had just put a spell on him to turn him into this really cute shark guy kind of like in beauty and the beast it could probably use a ballroom dance scene and maybe some singing <UNK> but there are some pretty gross plants instead they make this one girl really itchy so she lets herself get eaten by the shark guy instead of scratching through the whole movie the scientist guy is a good dad who tries to reunite his <UNK> shark son with the woman he was engaged to he even <UNK> for them to have private time for s e x but the woman in this is a really shallow <UNK> and thinks the shark guy is an ugly <UNK> monster and wants nothing to do with him she gave up on love just because he was a shark i thought it was pretty sad how all she had to do was kiss him and he'd turn back to normal and they'd live happily ever after but it's not that kind of movie
<START> in my opinion the best movie ever i love when people ask me what this film is about i usually smile and say life they <UNK> and probably never give it another thought the fact that everyone from every background can relate to some part of this movie makes it all that much more amazing <UNK> a must see for everyone
<START> easily the worst movie i have ever seen in my life direction none story pathetic screenplay that will be a good idea there is a lot of gratuitous graphics all of pathetic quality <UNK> your sanity dont ever see this movie
<START> somewhat funny and well paced action thriller that has jamie foxx as a hapless fast talking <UNK> who is chosen by an overly demanding u s <UNK> agent david morse to be released on the streets of new york to find a <UNK> computer thief <UNK> doug <UNK> who stole forty two million dollars from the <UNK> and left two guards shot dead br br bait marks the <UNK> feature for <UNK> <UNK> the replacement killers and he handles the task fairly well even though it doesn't top his first movie what the two films have in common is the action sequences which are flat out excellent br br foxx is pretty good here although his character is annoying in the beginning but throughout the film i began to catch on <UNK> is marvelous as the mastermind who can be ruthless as john <UNK> and patient as the late laurence olivier was in marathon man morse is okay as the agent who comes up with the ingenious plan to get whoever did it at all cost
<START> this <UNK> production has it's fans but to <UNK> the classic bad review of <UNK> <UNK> ' <UNK> dick is like a painting only slower br br this is because the philosophical grounds for a movie production are never to make a great film rather it's to substitute the lack of a strong <UNK> idea in this case for a books <UNK> to film with a list of hopelessly <UNK> <UNK> but dazzling <UNK> in an effort to trick viewers into thinking they've seen greatness as viewers critics are apt to fall for this oscars follow feeding the whole dumb <UNK> br br i don't share in the pleasure all these reviewers found <UNK> dick is stunningly <UNK> actors <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> about <UNK> <UNK> dick the ocean <UNK> dick <UNK> dick all things that can't respond and not one of which is absorbing in the slightest it's dramatically <UNK> it doesn't build in narrative terms <UNK> dick as a movie is little more than a <UNK> conclusion in search of an actual story after half an hour i was <UNK> oh terrific another <UNK> another 4 minute <UNK> br br in the failed effort to involve you it's a pretty campy overacting showcase a lot of grey hair here <UNK> is supposed to be a golden god br br one knows one is looking at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than trying to <UNK> the feel of someone else's paintings palette or <UNK> <UNK> a classic as huston does here paintings and books are nice but they're a different <UNK> a movie like this fails to grasp that an honestly enjoyable piece of crap village of the damned is better in most respects than an <UNK> piece of culture this is the eat your <UNK> school of film making br br one <UNK> the work that must have been done to make the movie but not the narrative only a few segments <UNK> <UNK> research are interesting the recording of <UNK> as a means of <UNK> work various sea efforts and the technology of <UNK> and that doesn't call for a two plus hour movie
<START> i don't know where to start the acting the special effects and the writing are all about as bad as you can possibly imagine i can't believe that the production staff reached a point where they said our job is done time for it's release i'm just glad the first two in the series never made it as far as the uk i would actually recommend watching this film just so you can appreciate how well made most films are br br i don't know how any of the other imdb users could find it scary when the terrifying dinosaurs <UNK> down corridors with rubber arms <UNK> around
<START> suffice it to say that this <UNK> b has nothing to save it not an interesting plot or even one <UNK> decent actor josh leonard of blair witch fame does little to help matters do yourself a favor and leave this one on the shelf at your local video store
<START> for anyone who's judged others at first meeting here is the perfect <UNK> on depth of character the grumpy old lady has a soft thoughtful heart and needs new friends the <UNK> unsure <UNK> dame who makes inappropriate uncomfortable comments sees deep into your soul and has pure love for all the cold <UNK> proper neglected wife has passion <UNK> that could <UNK> over at any minute given the right setting the perfect beauty rich sweet <UNK> pursued by <UNK> wants peace quiet and love without <UNK> br br by taking the time to look beyond the surface you will find <UNK> in everyday life from the least expected sources all it takes is patience and a touch of <UNK>
<START> pictures that usually <UNK> a hero have meaning as an example bonnie and clyde <UNK> the dynamic bank robbers and you actually felt sympathy for them despite their evil deeds why they were two people caught up in the depression when people were desperate to survive br br this film has absolutely no substance the viggo <UNK> character soon emerges as a folk hero why he <UNK> along an <UNK> highway on the way to the hospital where his stricken wife has been taking no one bothers to understand why he is trying to flee everyone even worse when the realization becomes apparent that he is not a red neck terrorist no one in government wants to help him as they try to save their rear ends br br jason <UNK> co stars as a radio <UNK> who builds upon the story in support of our hero br br the ending is absolutely unbelievable
<START> this was actually my favorite series of scooby doo when i was younger i thought each episode had more of an edge to it and the villains had a lot of creative thought put into them and even very scary and believable as well some of the best episodes were i left my neck in san francisco twenty thousand screams under the sea the <UNK> the bat and the ugly and when you wish upon a star creature if you have never seen these episodes please do this series was a bit of a mixed bag though as there were other episodes which didn't seem to have the same kind of edge to them such as rocky mountain <UNK> and the <UNK> of scooby chief as like the series before it it was very well put together interesting storyline and brilliantly drawn as everyone says though it would have been so much better without <UNK> doo the character was tiresome and distracting to the story that was being told
<START> i remember watching the bsg pilot i can describe that night exactly i remember what chair i sat in that show was magic it came alive i enjoyed the first two years of bsg i enjoyed parts of the third year even and i watched every episode of the fourth year totally <UNK> in great hopes that it would somehow turn around well it didn't br br i watched the caprica pilot and was enthralled there was hope for something good here then i started watching the regular episodes and they are getting more and more boring br br it's too obvious too predictable it reminds me of the <UNK> political correctness of his last failed show <UNK> br br much of his line work on <UNK> was good when he focused on bsg in an organized way it was good this was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first bsg series when they <UNK> from that after meeting up with <UNK> cain and the <UNK> it all went to pot it was like he wrote the rest of the show without knowing where he was going br br maybe it will improve maybe it was just a few weak initial episodes but i am very very nervous
<START> when i first tuned in on this morning news i thought wow finally some entertainment it was slightly amusing for a week or so but we have to face it these news <UNK> if one can even call them that have way too much playing around time br br at first i thought <UNK> was a breathe of fresh air but seriously this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her she is very <UNK> she keeps on <UNK> steve when he starts <UNK> the viewers about a certain news report it's just really become annoying to the point that i can't watch it anymore br br <UNK> is not a good journalist hell she's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity hence she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she's supposed to be <UNK> she's not very professional and quite possibly <UNK> her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully <UNK> journalist and that's all i can say about her br br also <UNK> this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world the government the us or something that will benefit and or serve the <UNK> best interest they're too focus on <UNK> that everything they talk about comes off as a commercial product on the other hand their field <UNK> are interestingly tolerable br br i believe good day la is for young teenagers and celebrities and it is definitely not for people who actually care about the news br br side note i'd really rather watch <UNK> however they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes they're still a bit dull though oh well i'll stick to <UNK> today <UNK> good morning america is also okay as long as diane <UNK> doesn't become way too serious
<START> this was the worst movie i have ever seen and i've seen a lot of bad movies first of i'm from kansas this movie does not have a shred of truth in it at all its like they took btk name and made up the rest on top of that it looks like someone was like i've only got 20 bucks here take it and make a movie and oh yeah don't worry about <UNK> btk at all just make up something seriously pure <UNK> no one should ever see this movie the <UNK> <UNK> scenes and making his victims eat stuff and describing animal slaughter btk did none of these things but the movie does so for the love of god never see this god awful movie the made for tv ones are way better and way more accurate
<START> bad bad bad bad bad what else can i say kate jackson must have been desperate to direct may be she should go back to acting on second thought she was a bad actress to who would put money in to producing something this bad i like anti christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the odd scare but this one is just bad bad bad the acting by the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera the special effects if you can call them that where laughable i would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion you would see the <UNK> the blood shoots out of we had to turn the disc off after only 30 minutes this so called movies original <UNK> should be destroyed all <UNK> and tapes destroyed and all the people associated with the making of the movie have to pay back money to the people that rented the movie then those people should never be allowed to act direct or film any thing but their own home movies
<START> i just saw this movie for the first time ever and i liked it her dancing was very entertaining i read somewhere that she got the part in this movie because she knew how to dance the scenery was great too <UNK> is such a talented woman and beautiful we laughed at the silly kissing scenes but that is what is great about old movies i grew up with her on the <UNK> and i am enjoying watching her in her earlier movies they may not all be the best out there but still worth watching to see her act and sing i am slowly <UNK> all her movies and watching them as i receive them i have a large collection of her <UNK>
<START> i don't think i need to tell you the story for it has been told for years and years so i will just share my feelings i first saw cinderella was when i was five years old from then on i was a disney child in a good way the animation now seems childish and old fashioned but that is part of its charm now now in the age of high school musical and computer generated images it seems like people have forgotten the genius and magical essence of early disney movies thankfully i was born before that so i was introduced to this classic and it seems no matter how old i get i turn back into that five year old watching it on vhs which is the true magic of disney
<START> i just finished a marathon of this series and it became <UNK> to watch as it progressed from the <UNK> of the historical elements to <UNK> awful accent in later episodes the show just <UNK> the further it goes if you are looking for some low quality production <UNK> ww2 fluff then i could recommend season 1 but avoid anything after that it <UNK> into being one step from a soap opera with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility br br the old b w film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the <UNK> name attached to it and even that is not what one could hope for
<START> shall we dance a light hearted flick from japan tells of an <UNK> <UNK> and family man who is attracted to a dance studio by a beautiful woman he <UNK> from the train during his daily <UNK> what he finds in the studio are lessons in dancing and most of all himself funny poignant and utterly charming <UNK> is an award winning film well worth a look by more mature viewers b
<START> whether you watch the regular version of this monstrosity or the mst3k version you can only be impressed by the utter <UNK> that went into this production the filmmakers insult the viewer's intelligence from one end to the other and obviously couldn't care less that they are doing so br br everything about it is rock bottom cheap even the 1950s car in the flashback sequence to that era looks like it was <UNK> out of a <UNK> br br the hobgoblins are as you probably know realized with badly crafted hand puppets and stuffed toys when a person is supposed to be attacked by them it's clear the toy is being held by the victim to his or her own body when the <UNK> <UNK> away from the two security guards this is shown or rather not shown by the camera aiming up at the guards as they look down and turn their heads as if watching the hobgoblins <UNK> past it's reminiscent of the scene in the film <UNK> where two people are standing in the ruins of a future world <UNK> the <UNK> and we aren't shown any of it budget constraints <UNK> with utter incompetence generally mean you won't have anything worth showing so why try the sets were utterly laughable club <UNK> was an obvious diner the house appears to have been a <UNK> house probably for rent or sale which the production company got hold of for an hour or two to do the shoot the <UNK> is something i would have been ashamed to build when i was a model making 10 year old br br the motivations of the characters make no sense kevin gets <UNK> by his worthless <UNK> of a girlfriend because he hasn't made her proud of him i'm sure this was intended to make their <UNK> oh so touching at the end but any guy with real self respect would have told her to go to hell and left her nick is supposedly back from 2 months of army training yeah nice <UNK> <UNK> nick and seems bent on proving that our country is being <UNK> by sadistic moronic animals who are sex <UNK> kyle is a phone sex freak in red shorts who dreams of a night with a <UNK> clad <UNK> type but he's so <UNK> that he's more likely gay than not one of the girls is a <UNK> and the other is a sleaze br br and the hobgoblins at the end they all head back to the vault where they've lived for 30 years why who knows who cares watch this film and be amazed at how primitive film making in our modern age can be when you have an idiotic script incompetent direction actors who are so bad they'd be rejected from a high school theater production and sets worthy of edward d wood jr
<START> this is one of the movies of <UNK> <UNK> who gave great yet distinct movies to hindi movie <UNK> such as jewel thief and guide the story is short if you ask me what is the story plot is simple a brother seeks for his lost sister sister has joined the hippies who smoke from pot and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> yet the movie portrays few of the significant events that the world experienced in 70's hippie culture their <UNK> to drugs freedom escaping duty family and <UNK> anything new such as eastern which was new for whites religion they have been handled perfectly <UNK> gave her best and <UNK> as usual was remarkable songs are the best used unlike they are abused for the sake of having songs in this movie they have not been spoiled one perfect example is <UNK> o <UNK> ram <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> each word in the song is very philosophical and meaningful the end is tragic but that is not the essence of the movie overall <UNK> who does believe in making different movies has been successful in showing what he wanted to show here a must see to experience hippie culture and beautiful <UNK> of 70's
<START> i remember when the golden child was released in 1986 it was universally <UNK> by the critics and i m talking <UNK> so badly that it more or less ended the <UNK> career of eddie murphy so i guess this movie has something going for it br br it gets off to a bad start where <UNK> monks <UNK> in front of a child with a blank expression on his face bad guys enter the temple br br child sits with blank expression br br bad guys chop up the monks br br child sits with blank expression br br bad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with go on guess you do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a <UNK> at michael jackson s wonderland ranch he d still give the same blank expression this movie would be better titled the wooden child br br the title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980s a pop soundtrack features heavily obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated not only that but it <UNK> completely with the somewhat bloody opening in fact that s the main problem and boy it s a serious one with this movie the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together i blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too did anyone know before shooting <UNK> what type of movie this was going to be it s part fantasy part martial arts part buddy movie part comedy and it s all crap
<START> alan <UNK> plays real life sports illustrated writer george <UNK> who was once invited to join the detroit lions football team as an <UNK> member rather wan <UNK> drama curiously <UNK> with fantasy director alex march takes an interesting <UNK> on this material shooting it in a quasi documentary fashion with macho commentary and yet giving the tale a touch of <UNK> <UNK> still by bringing out the cinematic <UNK> in this set up he turns the main narrative into a <UNK> <UNK> smug <UNK> performance is another <UNK> though the supporting cast is filled with real life pro <UNK> and <UNK> lauren <UNK> as <UNK> girlfriend <UNK> that for a fantasy 1 2 from
<START> one of the all time great science fiction works as <UNK> and thought provoking as blade runner or even <UNK> own brazil willis gives his best performance here but he's <UNK> by <UNK> incredibly frenetic turn that's unlike anything he's done before or since even <UNK> isn't out of her league here though the story is very layered and offers quite a lot to think about the climactic scene is beautifully magnificent and the last lines fit perfectly the scenes in the mental hospital are creepy and yet so funny in their own way lots of dark humour on display here fantastic production design and suitably bizarre cinematography in my top ten
<START> she is such an extraordinary singer who cares about anything else that final scene is one of the best moments in all of show <UNK> bar none i'm glad she kept the camera on herself for ten minutes she deserves that iconic status such is the power of the voice br br i first saw this film when i was five and it had a huge impact on me i see it today and yes i can see some of the flaws like esther wanting to leave the <UNK> right as her award is being announced br br but some of the other user comments are just plain false i mean where is the gratuitous nudity maybe we saw different films br br <UNK> singing ability is monumental and if she has a big ego fine br br she's earned it
<START> oh where are you going my little one little one br br turn around and you're two turn around and you're four br br i remember these shows when they were first broadcast on <UNK> i remember sitting there <UNK> by <UNK> van <UNK> explanations of rocket science i watched as history science and humor were all <UNK> in an engrossing story of possibilities br br that was fifty years ago and the shows are back in the disney <UNK> series and what a treasure they are i watched them last night and tonight with my 8 year old daughter who at first would not even come in the room but later changed her mind when she saw they were partly animated as she watched i watched her and by the end she was nearly as <UNK> as i had been br br turn around and you're a young wife with babes of your own br br sure some of the <UNK> about reaching the moon were wrong but there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate and the overall presentation is still impressive i found myself thinking my daughter's teacher might want to show them to her class not only as a 50 year old <UNK> but also as fun and easy to understand lessons in history br br turn around turn around turn around and again you're wondering how much has really changed in 50 years
<START> pet <UNK> 1989 9 10 the <UNK> family have just moved into the small town of <UNK> the family consists of a father louis a mother rachel a brother gage and a daughter ellen they are <UNK> with kindness by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> and could basically tell you about the entire history of <UNK> br br behind the <UNK> new house there is a path leading to a pet cemetery spelled pet sematary when ellen wants to go up to see it <UNK> <UNK> takes the family on a trip that is the start of hell for the <UNK> family br br when rachel and the kids are gone <UNK> cat church dies <UNK> feels that ellen isn't ready for the death of her cat so he suggests louis follow him further up the path past the pet cemetery br br <UNK> tells louis of this burial ground once used by <UNK> indians louis <UNK> church without <UNK> help a couple of days later church returns alive but from hell br br this movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me aside from the exorcist the greatest performance would ever be <UNK> <UNK> sister with spinal <UNK> or victor <UNK> a ghost who tries to help the <UNK> from making the mistake of bringing back things from the dead br br the music in this movie plays an <UNK> part it is at the same time sad and mysterious it goes along with the movie wonderfully br br 9 10
<START> simply awful slasher <UNK> from the i know what you did last summer type of fodder has beautiful wealthy college students spending spring break in a florida <UNK> being murdered one by one a misfire in every category imaginable from properly built suspense to the executed death sequences nothing is handled properly and the characters leave little more than caricatures you root to see <UNK> as quick as possible del <UNK> the curse of the living corpse i eat your skin of all people executive produced co wrote and stars as a priest in a pivotal role whose relationship to the killer i guess means something to why he's psychotic the revelation of the killer is <UNK> handled and <UNK> probably not surprising a soul who watches it there are a lot of attempted jump scares with one character popping out to <UNK> their friend which couldn't even <UNK> a few cheap thrills because they are so <UNK> in such a tepid way most of the attacks occur off screen with bleeding throat cuts or <UNK> representing the only real display of violence the <UNK> finale where the killer goes on and on with the actor desperately trying to make his villain as diabolical and demented as possible is embarrassing and tense less there's not one single positive to <UNK> from this clichéd and dull exercise with the pretty cast making little effort to rise past their one dimensional roles and for pity sake they could've at least allowed us to see joey lawrence get decapitated or something for <UNK> the misery of sitting through this junk heap for 90 <UNK> minutes br br <UNK> barton as the heroine final girl beth morgan who the killer seems to be obsessed with couldn't be more vacuous and uninteresting oh she was in <UNK> and takes <UNK> for her nightmares such intriguing exposition <UNK> allen cast against type as a very <UNK> friend of the group who happens to disappear from the film first setting up the idea that he's the first victim has a tough hill to climb with his role so <UNK> he eventually stumbles rolling <UNK> with no end in sight jeff <UNK> needing some cash i guess has the <UNK> fbi agent role whose daughter's murder <UNK> him to seek out the killer leading him to florida jack <UNK> has his usual a hole role as a smart mouth florida police chief who is often nose to nose with <UNK> agent br br oh the answer to the <UNK> question not really because once you get the answer you will wonder why you bothered with this anyway
<START> my how the mighty have fallen kim basinger is a great actress but she was definitely <UNK> when she took this role this movie is bad for one reason in particular <UNK> in logic its looks like one of those movies that would have been passable with all its plot holes if it had came out in the 80s and 90s but in 2008 it just looks real stupid this is the worst thriller i've ever seen and i've seen the bone collector and twisted br br the story details della kim basinger is just getting from buying gifts in a mall an is <UNK> by a gang of thugs that end up killing a cop that came to her aid from then on she is chased by these idiotic <UNK> through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a <UNK> full of tools br br so many things are wrong with this movie as i said this movie leaps over logic at every turn and with the exception of kim basinger the acting is made for tv bad hell this pseudo thriller is made for tv bad the way she kills each of these politically correct thugs 1 <UNK> 1 hispanic 1 asian and 1 african american all coming together to stalk a <UNK> woman don't you just love america is laughable to a fault the way she killed the hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically the sex scene with the main <UNK> was so out in left field that it make you shake your head in shame i only recommend this to lovers of bad films and no one else anybody else especially kim basinger fans would do well not to own this flick you don't want see an actress you respect in a film this bad now do you of course not you were warned
<START> spoilers br br from the very moment i saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10 00 news i wanted to see it i don't remember who it was or which local <UNK> <UNK> carried the review but the critic was very <UNK> that this film was way too sleazy for the average church going <UNK> they showed a <UNK> from the scene where john glover is about to kidnap ann <UNK> when she's swimming in the pool <UNK> character is <UNK> her on how nice her body is and so forth using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out i was hooked there was one problem though i was only 13 years old at the time and i had to wait a year until it came out on cable let's just say it was worth the wait br br if ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine this movie is it to call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement the film centers around a successful businessman who is <UNK> by three small time <UNK> after an affair with a young woman roy <UNK> who is as effective as ever plays the poor guy who just wanted a little <UNK> and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains john <UNK> character is one of the most memorable <UNK> of all time he's sleazy funny at times and always on the brink of doing something crazy then there's robert <UNK> nice name by the way character leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme he is a <UNK> <UNK> coward who runs a <UNK> show place with live nude models then you have clarence williams iii as bobby shy a brooding <UNK> who everyone is afraid of with good reason who could forget the wake up call he gives vanity with the giant teddy bear br br after dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he's up against <UNK> turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation that is until glover goes after his wife the conflict is played out brutally with virtually the entire cast getting shot raped or blown up br br i don't know why i love this movie so much it really should creep me out but it doesn't maybe it's because these characters are all interesting and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try it's scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like <UNK> running around out in l a looking for trouble just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle hey sport have a nice day br br this film has plenty of <UNK> cool cars great dialog like the line in my opening statement and decent acting plenty of cameos by real life porno stars look for ron jeremy <UNK> around in a hot <UNK> with two chicks in a party scene at <UNK> place br br another thing i must add how hot are the women in this film wow travolta did right by marrying kelly preston <UNK> we also see vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again christian and ann <UNK> what else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential american beauty br br 9 of 10 stars br br so <UNK> the <UNK> br br added <UNK> 14 2008 rip roy <UNK>
<START> a comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little british effort the divorce of lady x 1938 it marks the first pairing of laurence olivier and <UNK> <UNK> before that little film about <UNK> passion on the 19th century english <UNK> and while olivier and <UNK> are not particularly well suited to screwball comedy it all flows along nicely <UNK> is leslie a young woman who ends up in <UNK> divorce lawyer <UNK> olivier hotel <UNK> by way of a nasty english fog <UNK> travel she does everything possible to <UNK> him but in the crazy way films go he falls for her and she falls for him but a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when <UNK> lady x that's all she leaves oliver in a note is thought by olivier to be a married woman to make matters worse and more amusing lord mere ralph richardson goes to olivier wanting a divorce from his wife whom dear larry thinks must be <UNK> there is some nice battle of the <UNK> dialogue and fun exploration of sexual politics you can see that olivier is not too confident with the comedy but in true olivier he's a <UNK> professional and delivers and he handles the screwball twists and turns maybe not with ease but with gusto <UNK> was no great shakes as an actress but she was usually competent enough and despite their <UNK> off screen dislike of her worked well with olivier this was filmed in early <UNK> that looks very primitive today everyone looks even <UNK> than michael jackson but perhaps the print needs cleaning up
<START> this is one excellent sammo hung movie actually this is a great piece of hong kong action cinema the story tells the story of <UNK> drivers in <UNK> looking for love and getting mixed up w a vicious <UNK> the performances are excellent and the characters are all likable and well defined the story is involving and has enough romance drama comedy and suspense to keep one watching between fight scenes sammo hung proves here that he's probably the best fight choreographer in the business the action is simply amazing <UNK> the fight w <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the finale billy <UNK> and sammo hung are amazing a must see for any fan of action
<START> almost golden the jessica <UNK> story br br aspect ratio 1 33 1 br br sound format <UNK> br br bland soap opera <UNK> of the rise and fall of america's first female tv news anchor with a <UNK> script and direction and a better cast this might have passed <UNK> but the flimsy story really wasn't worth the effort a good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go typically strong production values in the tv movie <UNK> belt manner but it's all as superficial as old fluff and just as engaging
<START> oh it really really is i've seen films that i disliked more due to whatever reason but never have i seen a film that just fails in every single aspect of film making it even fails to fail at film making in a way the <UNK> in new york could be said to do it's not the film i like the least but it is the very worst film i've ever seen br br the acting is the first thing that strikes you i've never seen a worse acted film outside of pornography in fact i've plenty of pornographic films that are acted a damn site better than this it really is awful br br technically it's terrible the camera work is amateurish the editing is nonsensical i presume they couldn't afford proper sound equipment and this meant that every scene in a car and there's a lot of them has them driving at about three miles per hour and every scene set outside by the same <UNK> of woods and there's a lot of them too is actually dubbed from a studio again <UNK> more to the bad porn vibe br br the plot is nonsensical as many have pointed out i'll defend vampires walking in daylight by the fact that despite it being <UNK> by <UNK> this was never originally an <UNK> part of the vampire <UNK> br br speaking of vampire <UNK> the writer had evidently read <UNK> or at very least seen the vampire lovers i'm not sure how i feel about this <UNK> from impressed that a movie this dire has at least some aspirations to a gothic novel i'm very fond of or annoyed by its at best <UNK> references and at worst total <UNK> of source material at very least 'the <UNK> is an insult to peter cushing though br br it gets two stars however merely because i can't bring myself to vote one star for a film that has or at least <UNK> to have both vampires and zombies in it incidentally i watched <UNK> another film that <UNK> has vampires and zombies in it on the same day as this and despite being a rather flawed film itself really comes out a masterpiece compared to this br br so in the end this is not a film so bad it's good or so bad it's in any way enjoyable even drunk it's just a mess and worth no one's time watching
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> 'the sea is <UNK> was <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to film his adaptation of his <UNK> novelist <UNK> <UNK> story into a screenplay he intended to film was his final mark he left on a brilliant career director <UNK> <UNK> pays homage to both kurosawa and <UNK> in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to image br br set in 19th century japan the story explores the lives of the women of a geisha house whose sole purpose in life is to earn money by <UNK> men the house is run by an older couple who are <UNK> and the <UNK> are an enchanting group of women who know their trade and take pride in their careers each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> supports her family who live in a <UNK> village <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has customers both good and evil whom she manages to sustain with her stories of her higher <UNK> <UNK> befriends an <UNK> samurai falls in love with the gentle fellow only to find that he must not marry out of his <UNK> and leaves his pleasures with <UNK> to marry his promised <UNK> <UNK> heart <UNK> easily but is always supported emotionally and physically <UNK> by <UNK> and the other <UNK> br br a handsome samurai <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> enters <UNK> life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her <UNK> is <UNK> by problems deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her and <UNK> with a rich but abusive <UNK> all the while the sea is watching and as a <UNK> destroys the geisha house and street <UNK> and <UNK> sit <UNK> the roof waiting for the promised rescue by <UNK> the manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice love and devotion the sea is watching and will find protection for true love br br the photography by <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> beautiful night scenes with glowing <UNK> and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and <UNK> the acting is a bit strained for <UNK> art but the characters are well created and keep the story credible the one distraction which is definitely not something kurosawa would have <UNK> is the tacky western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real japanese music on authentic <UNK> <UNK> the track but in the end there is enough of <UNK> influence to <UNK> this film with his brand of <UNK> wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema grady <UNK>
<START> i am curious yellow is a <UNK> and pretentious steaming pile it doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level as for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic <UNK> 17 that isn't true i've seen r rated films with male nudity granted they only offer some fleeting views but where are the r rated films with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> nowhere because they don't exist the same goes for those crappy cable shows <UNK> swinging in the <UNK> but not a <UNK> in sight and those pretentious indie movies like the brown bunny in which we're treated to the site of vincent <UNK> <UNK> johnson but not a trace of pink visible on chloe <UNK> before crying or <UNK> double standard in matters of nudity the mentally <UNK> should take into account one <UNK> obvious <UNK> difference between men and women there are no <UNK> on display when actresses appears nude and the same cannot be said for a man in fact you generally won't see female <UNK> in an american film in anything short of porn or explicit <UNK> this alleged double standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms <UNK> with the <UNK> of women's bodies
<START> i thought that zombie flesh <UNK> 2 was quite a good horror film when a <UNK> body infected with a stolen chemical is <UNK> by the us military the corpse is then <UNK> releasing the virus into the atmosphere over a small island soon the infected locals turn into flesh hungry zombies and a group of soldiers on leave must team up with a group of tourists and board themselves up in a abandoned hotel as they try to fight off the aggressive living dead i did not find this film to be as good as the original film zombie flesh <UNK> but it was still an ok horror film with some good action i did not think that it was one of the best in the series 4 10
<START> this is a lot of silliness about a woman from london who marries a tea <UNK> from <UNK> whom she barely knows it's full of cliches and the liz taylor character is not believable it has a marvelous set some exotic location footage it shows taylor at the height of her beauty she looks stunning
<START> i have read the other comment about this movie and usually i try not to be harsh in my criticisms because i try to be a nice person however this movie is one of the worst movies that i have ever seen and thats <UNK> a lot of bad usa network plus <UNK> nights whoever thought of this movie needs to be prevented from ever making another one this film disgusted me in a way that no other film ever i really think these people are insane just save your time and do not watch this <UNK> please i wish that i had the acting is horrible the plot what plot is stupid and <UNK> and insane i really do not think this should have been made into a movie but that is my opinion and i am trying to save you from wasting your time
<START> if you want to watch something that is for <UNK> and <UNK> so to say then this is the film to pick i am a sucker for <UNK> <UNK> but my husband is not always so keen what a guy anyway i managed to get him to watch it because i told him it was about sport and you know what he loved it br br drew barrymore is very funny and her leading man sorry but can't remember his name is equally as good when i watched the film it was called 'the perfect <UNK> but i think the title was changed for the uk as it is based on the book fever pitch and there was already a film made about football with that title the same film but the uk version <UNK> br br anyway all of the reviews on here will tell you more details if you need them buy girls take it from me get your <UNK> boyfriend in front of the television on a saturday night and you will both laugh and cry together a real gem
<START> if the term itself were not <UNK> and <UNK> meaningless one might well refer to ned kelly as an australian western for the people down under ned kelly was apparently a folk hero <UNK> akin to robin hood jesse james bonnie and clyde and butch cassidy and the sundance kid the <UNK> of irish immigrants kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was <UNK> accused of shooting an australian law officer a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison to get back at the government for this <UNK> kelly his brother dan and two other companions became notorious bank robbers winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where irish immigrants were often treated with <UNK> and disdain by those who ran the country br br perhaps because we've encountered this gentleman <UNK> scenario so many times in the past ned kelly feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the <UNK> stereotypes and clichés on its way to the inevitable showdown ned is the typical heart of gold <UNK> who kills only when he is forced to and even then only with the deepest regret he also has the pulse of the common folk as when in the middle of a bank robbery he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers after one of his gang has so <UNK> <UNK> it what movie on this particular subject hasn't featured a scene like that it's acts of <UNK> <UNK> like this of course that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers that be and the status <UNK> geoffrey rush plays the typical <UNK> law <UNK> who feels a personal stake in bringing down this <UNK> <UNK> who keeps getting away with <UNK> the establishment there's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers so turned on is she by the romantic <UNK> do of the criminal lifestyle and the film is <UNK> with one hackneyed scene like this after another br br heath ledger fails to <UNK> himself in the title role providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging it doesn't help that he has been forced to provide a <UNK> voice over narration that <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> of both the character and the film br br ned kelly might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in australian history but as an entertainment it's just the same old story told with different accents
<START> what a poor image of professional police officers is displayed on the television in the watching of this alleged reality show one can only hope that the actual reasonable suspicion that leads to <UNK> cause that leads to the <UNK> of the circumstances involved to make a stop then the pat down of the outside of one's <UNK> then to be able to <UNK> why the officer went into someone's pocket and <UNK> <UNK> was cut out of the scenes because if it wasn't the arrest in most places are going to be tossed should they even get passed a <UNK> a report of a warrant over the radio does not <UNK> the actual existence of the warrant unless the person <UNK> has the original warrant in hand if the <UNK> is reading from a computer <UNK> it is good enough for an arrest but it does not necessarily mean the warrant is still in effect since i haven't seen a <UNK> <UNK> from cbs i may have missed it cbs could be in trouble
<START> ok i will sum up this movie a bunch of <UNK> british women have some disease that basically is turning them into zombies the whole movie consists of these women talking smoking and rarely going out for meat or humans to eat i swear i had to make myself watch this movie ugh
