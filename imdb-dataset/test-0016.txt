<START> the story of <UNK> todd evokes memories of the work of classic writers like charles dickens and more contemporary writers like edward gory as a musical it naturally becomes more like the musical les <UNK> both deal with the grim effects of poverty in the industrial revolution and the breakdown of organized society but this musical is different from les <UNK> in one very important aspect stephen <UNK> the <UNK> who can adapt to any style to be sure he's had his <UNK> and failures but one thing about his shows you can always count on they will be something unique who would have thought someone would write a musical about a <UNK> who <UNK> people's throats and makes them into meat <UNK> <UNK> did and he did it <UNK> the entire show is set in a factory to suggest the ever present <UNK> effects of the misery of those at the bottom of society and this serves the needs of the show perfectly the <UNK> and are moved throughout to suggest streets and <UNK> and bridges techniques are borrowed from <UNK> and with the visual <UNK> and set changes then to top it all off cast the great angela lansbury as the <UNK> practical and humorous mrs <UNK> and george with his operatic <UNK> voice as the murderous todd and you've got yourself a stellar musical vehicle the rest of the cast moves smoothly through the clich√©s of the love story perfectly except for <UNK> and who sound a bit too forced if the <UNK> and from the broadway show could be here it would be perfect acts while he sings more than <UNK> on the album and the accents don't sound as forced here through it all <UNK> score never fails to <UNK> the dark seriousness of the story as i said he can adapt to any style in <UNK> he <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> style of <UNK> in pacific <UNK> he captures the subtle art of asian music into the woods knocks off the <UNK> bar disney style songs and <UNK> covers a history of american music here however he does wonders in making his score distinctly english from <UNK> songs to operatic <UNK> and <UNK> to society <UNK> to gilbert sullivan style <UNK> and yet still the show remains deadly serious even though it <UNK> more laughs than any musical comedy in it still is a grim warning on the <UNK> of taking revenge here is where this movie makes a mistake in cutting the <UNK> solo in which he himself out of guilt for his crimes without it the judge is just a conventional villain and this movie's point is that there are no straight villains both todd and the judge learn too late the horrors of having to accept responsibility for their actions and todd loses everything in his obsession this is well brought out by the chilling <UNK> of the grim yet <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> todd ending the show with todd and <UNK> rising from the grave to tell us that the end is the same in a world full of vengeance <UNK> only vengeance attend the tale of <UNK> todd he served a dark and a vengeful god to seek revenge may lead to hell but everyone does it and seldom as well as <UNK> as <UNK> todd the demon <UNK> of fleet street
<START> documentaries in which sons and daughters seek to understand a parent and by the process their own lives are not that <UNK> also not <UNK> are results that reflect lack of talent a failure of <UNK> an abundance of <UNK> and perhaps an <UNK> quest for <UNK> <UNK> revenge for countless past hurts real and <UNK> what is unusual is a brilliant fair and engrossing portrait of a fascinating parent and my architect a son's journey is that rare achievement br br louis <UNK> <UNK> to this country as a child his face <UNK> and brutally <UNK> by an accident he and his parents settled in philadelphia where the talented <UNK> loved art and music soon he became <UNK> of buildings and decided only an career would answer his creative abilities br br <UNK> became an architect but as this film shows it took a long time before he attracted the attention of the leaders in his field one architect suggests that he was a victim of the yellow <UNK> that anti <UNK> that along with bias against women was long a <UNK> aspect of the american profession of architecture br br when he did achieve notice he was seen clearly accurately as a self assured <UNK> prophet <UNK> <UNK> demands that his vision and only his vision be realized that was the reason that while he drew wonderful plans for many buildings he built but a few the interview with an aged gentleman who fired <UNK> in philadelphia because of his <UNK> dream of a transformed urban center where people left their cars on the <UNK> and walked into the city is hilarious br br <UNK> was a born teacher and some of the extensive <UNK> footage here shows him with students his voice steady but passionate their <UNK> <UNK> and intense br br many <UNK> were interviewed by director writer and project <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the only son some are world famous i m <UNK> robert a m stone frank and the still active philip johnson their comments paint a vivid picture of this idealistic but in the end <UNK> <UNK> designer of buildings that <UNK> the <UNK> and grand buildings of past centuries into designs for the present <UNK> buildings are shown among the most impressive being the <UNK> research <UNK> in la <UNK> to me his style has a neo romantic air <UNK> by too much blank space that <UNK> rather than <UNK> human interaction br br but <UNK> son was after more than the story of his father the architect for many years louis <UNK> had three families a wife with whom he had a daughter and two long term relationships one of which produced a daughter the other the son <UNK> visited his son at the mother's home often but at the end of an evening mother and son would drive <UNK> back to the marital home <UNK> clearly wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships but he doesn't appear to be <UNK> by what was certainly a strange affair for a little boy br br when <UNK> was a young boy louis <UNK> died of a massive heart attack in the men's room of new <UNK> <UNK> station after returning from india where he had pitched one of his massive projects another one that was never built at that point his philadelphia firm was at least 500 000 in debt and had he lived a trip to the federal <UNK> court was probably in the <UNK> br br <UNK> left several monumental <UNK> of which the government building in <UNK> is clearly the biggest a <UNK> local architect <UNK> <UNK> for having created a building where democracy may and hopefully will <UNK> br br fellow architect <UNK> that there might have been something fitting in <UNK> suffering a mortal heart attack in a train station given his <UNK> <UNK> i disagree it's sadly ironic that <UNK> should die in the <UNK> replacement for one of america's true <UNK> gems the old <UNK> station <UNK> to make way for a <UNK> replacement with no character and no <UNK> of <UNK> memory br br there are a number of emotional moments filmed during the younger <UNK> journey including with his half sisters and his mother but they're genuine and moving not <UNK> and staged historians of architecture will always study <UNK> his son found reasons to remember him as a flawed but very <UNK> and ultimately private man br br 9 10
<START> this is one of the most enjoyable teen movies i have ever seen and that i wished was released to video it was released the same year as another great comedy in which tim <UNK> played a role animal house which is probably why it was overlooked br br one of the most memorable parts of this film would definitely be the soundtrack which could have and should have been a <UNK> label release the soundtrack features a lesser known 70's act named high whose song we are the future played a <UNK> role in the movie's prom scene i remember <UNK> the <UNK> album out as a kid mainly because of the look of the girls and not necessarily for their musical talents br br the closing song is one of the best <UNK> i have ever heard and i can still hear it in my head i wish i knew the <UNK> name so that i could look for it somewhere in <UNK> br br if you liked films such as over the edge and rich kids i think this is one that you will enjoy as well
<START> tom <UNK> plays an <UNK> son to <UNK> pop don <UNK> and weary mom anne jackson making up for his <UNK> one <UNK> and taking them in after <UNK> has burned down his mobile home meanwhile job is <UNK> by the f b i his <UNK> are frozen his wife and kids leave him and his obnoxious sister and her <UNK> have come to stay <UNK> painted comedy of <UNK> is as out of touch with reality as <UNK> <UNK> old <UNK> perhaps a serious first draft with scenes such as <UNK> walking out into traffic with two <UNK> was <UNK> into a <UNK> second or third version with <UNK> getting <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and eventually losing a toe and a <UNK> either way it's a painful experience and sudden dedication to his father makes little sense he around and <UNK> in pain but <UNK> his heart of <UNK> this movie is <UNK> from
<START> a wonderful family movie a beautiful horse movie 75 entertainment <UNK> buddy kelly <UNK> are very interesting and lovable characters the horses are real <UNK> br br has the horse racing as a backdrop for showing how luck is sometimes nothing but some good <UNK> shows how kids can do stupid things for stupid reasons shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons the very realistically portrayed characters <UNK> the unrealistic theme of the film into something everyone can relate to br br andrew <UNK> puts in a wonderful performance as buddy the sensible elder brother somewhat reminded me of <UNK> quinn eyes speech delivery facial appearance br br <UNK> makes you fall in love with the character because of the <UNK> sarah blue is also nicely portrayed by <UNK> smith lloyd the father is played by walter matthau and he is the character br br though there is room for improvement in the movie its a very enjoyable feel good movie
<START> the best thing one can say about the film traffic is that it brought attention to the superior british mini series as many people have noted the current film suffers from the story to <UNK> the short attention span of and the turn around time of the theater owners who measure a film's success by the <UNK> food sales br br i first recorded this mini series in 1990 when it was shown on public tv and have watched it many times the whole documentary style series has a strong element of tragedy and doom about it as the characters are all moving toward their eventual fate the strongest of the three tales is that of the <UNK> family forced into the city to find a way to keep body and soul together after the <UNK> crop is burned by the army in a staged show of force put on for the benefit of western politicians the <UNK> of the family are similar to that of the <UNK> <UNK> family in city of joy eventually the farmer finds work but he <UNK> his pride and honesty br br the <UNK> segment of the film has a particular relevance to today with the fight against the supporters of al and gives some understanding of the support for such movements among the <UNK> poor of <UNK> and afghanistan who rarely receive any of the money going into those countries the film makes a point that the <UNK> see barely 25 of the aid which is supposed to encourage them to grow other <UNK> br br with the american inability to see anything other than in terms of black and white good guys v bad guys it is interesting to see another view where there is no black and white only shades of grey br br possible spoiler ahead the only problem i had with the story was that rather than things continuing as they did before as they would in real life being a work of fiction they had to wrap it up with the bad guys getting what was coming to them other than that this was a fine piece of work of the kind we see all too rarely the cast was outstanding and the german and <UNK> locations helped give the film a different feel what a change it made seeing germans as something other than the villains in a wwii film
<START> just like all of mel <UNK> other comedies men in <UNK> is hilarious but in seeing this as an outrageous comedy i think many fail to realize that the reason the movie is so funny is that the characters themselves are acted so well <UNK> is the well spoken former british noble lewis is an <UNK> annoyed king i hope it's worth all the <UNK> is a fantastic godfather roger <UNK> is a worried and cynical sheriff the actors and actresses are so loyal to their parts that the jokes flow forth with ease yes we've seen this kind of comedy before but the only comedy to achieve better character development in my opinion is the big <UNK> very very funny
<START> doug <UNK> has starred in a few of these british produced genre adventures and this one has got to be the worst of the lot i know the land that time forgot has its critics but please at least that movie featured location filming and relatively good production values that's the problem with this movie the production values go way beyond so bad they're good <UNK> territory and become so bad i think i'll go and see what's on the other channels br br one case in point is the first scene featuring the <UNK> cushing and <UNK> <UNK> a monster it's painfully obvious the monster is an average sized man dressed up as a rubber monster being made to look over twenty foot tall via overblown back projection it becomes even more painfully obvious that our heroes are trying to escape the monster by running on the spot have i mentioned that this is one of the more convincing set pieces no really this looks like it was filmed in <UNK> living room with the spare change left over from that year's doctor who budget even former doctor who peter cushing is bland and what should have been an amusing line you can't me i'm british is delivered in a very flat way a very similar line is spoken by cushing in horror express in a script devoid of characterisation plotting and memorable dialogue it's not just the fact that the dialogue is <UNK> it's also <UNK> and rare since the monsters don't speak wouldn't it have been better having the chief bad guys <UNK> like in <UNK> of atlantis so that they could explain the plot does anyone here know what the plot actually is br br a very tedious british movie that even the twin talents of caroline <UNK> can not save the whole mood of the movie is summed up by the final sequence featuring two <UNK> cops
<START> the most enjoyable pet movie since scooby doo and garfield the story revolves around a 23 year old <UNK> named brian foster whose systems at his <UNK> company seems to keep failing brian is also dating the <UNK> daughter named <UNK> but brian secretly invented a robotic dog named <UNK> <UNK> after his own dog <UNK> but <UNK> is no <UNK> dog he is as fast as a <UNK> he has x ray vision can leap about 6 feet and has a strength of 20 men the new invention <UNK> his boss and makes his business a success but when the company rivals hear about <UNK> they try to find a way to capture him can <UNK> <UNK> them before its too late this movie is a classic for all ages
<START> a trio sit at a restaurant table and stare into space later they lean on a <UNK> and stare across the channel at england a man works a <UNK> <UNK> in his garden only his head and upper <UNK> visible on the screen a man and a woman watch another man <UNK> against a stone wall each of these silent shots lasts for roughly one full minute absolutely no information is <UNK> that could not be given to us in about one quarter of the time the editor must have been half asleep i know i was br br the movie open with a startling shot of the raw <UNK> of an obviously dead body one's <UNK> rises but then the policeman <UNK> a few words with a <UNK> couple and begins to tag along after them and the case is forgotten for the next half hour while and his friends trade unfunny insults with each other and with strangers eventually the thread of the case is picked up again but proceeds slowly almost <UNK> following the <UNK> pattern already established br br sometimes in movies like this the location shooting provides a kind of atmosphere that <UNK> for the <UNK> of the story but not here the houses of the french village are attached to one another in long <UNK> the house <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> directly with no steps the <UNK> show virtually no decoration and are pretty much <UNK> the flat are <UNK> what might have been one of the more interesting episodes a visit to a stone <UNK> on the coast <UNK> the trio until they begin behaving like and are asked to leave br br the acting is minimal nobody seems particularly anxious to say anything no jokes are made nothing amusing happens the policeman has a face almost as interesting as randy <UNK> the babe a tall <UNK> blonde looks like the kind of shot <UNK> on <UNK> that the east germans used to field at the olympic games br br i sat through more than an hour of it before giving it up maybe i'll take a crack at it some other time unless i've missed something or unless it turns into some deranged monty python routine towards the end i don't think you'll get much out of renting it
<START> eric <UNK> <UNK> janet it should have been almost impossible to go wrong of course it has some funny moments the scene in the <UNK> when <UNK> echoes <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ghastly werewolf line i can't help myself is hilarious but ultimately the plot script and direction are flat as a <UNK> and as tired as a 90 year old nun after <UNK> <UNK> mary s when i was a child carry on films filled this <UNK> slightly better which is a really sad <UNK> of a film with such a promising cast
<START> all the people who voted a <UNK> 1 on this movie this is all i have to say you guys have not <UNK> enough to enjoy cinema of this kind it takes a certain amount of dedication to reach that level of appreciation and that is the segment of people this movie was aimed at not you average movie goers by any chance back to the movie this one was a gem all right and definitely an inclusion in the bollywood hall of fame i'd give it an all time rank of no 2 <UNK> only by <UNK> legendary this movie had an impeccable story line and created a beautiful blend between a fantasy and sci fi <UNK> <UNK> would have in fact been ashamed of the balance created between the parallel stories and now do i really need to mention the stellar cast and even stellar er that is a word from now performances from them a special mention goes to mr for the best debut ever in any movie on this earth every actor in this movie had been very carefully chosen and the role were <UNK> made for them and for their age too i must add still looks like she's 18 and wow man with that figure i would have raped her too are you wondering where did this rape thing come in suddenly yes a rape is what the premises of this movie is based on and that is so not like your average bollywood type movies if you are an <UNK> or an <UNK> by any chance this movie is again a must for you because this movie can <UNK> your faith i don't think it'd even be going too far saying that this movie can cure cancer only the people who need it the most fail to appreciate its power charm and <UNK> beauty so unfortunate br br only flaw in this movie in your dreams baby this was flawless br br only minor complain the director failed to star <UNK> da as well br br i won't ruin it for you any further just go and watch it today and if you like it here are some more recommendation from me <UNK> the old <UNK> brothers horror movies <UNK> the tiger and <UNK>
<START> barbara stanwyck probably didn't think of it but it is a relief to see her in a more becoming dark <UNK> if it wasn't a wig than the one she had to wear in double <UNK> the year before that film while the premiere film noir and an all around great film gave her a great role but oh that hair here she is more <UNK> and certainly no femme fatal but she is certainly a 40's woman she has gotten used to life without men since most of them are off at war and as a successful martha stewart like <UNK> she writes a <UNK> <UNK> in which she describes her country home as the camera pans over what it really is we meet her boss sydney <UNK> who has no idea that she is living a lie and when he pushes his way in for a christmas away at her supposed <UNK> home she has to come up with a husband <UNK> <UNK> and baby before we can say <UNK> <UNK> hungarian chef s z steps in to help and ends up in a pie one on one with irish <UNK> <UNK> it's not it's irish <UNK> simply takes the <UNK> <UNK> most of it in and says now it's totally changing what she has prepared for lunch then when it comes to the he <UNK> and she <UNK> for years a few friends of mine and i will use that line every time <UNK> come up in a conversation i don't flip i scoop she won't even flip just one for <UNK> saying i've never <UNK> in me life <UNK> can get on the nerves when she <UNK> over and over in some films but here she is delightfully lovable and her pairing with is very charming br br it is obvious in the romance department that <UNK> <UNK> is not barbara <UNK> cup of tea especially when she meets handsome dennis morgan who is a bit <UNK> when bathing the baby which eats soap causing stanwyck to get a bit <UNK> he should suspect something instantly but doesn't but it doesn't matter the film is so charming with the country setting filled with snow an abundance of <UNK> <UNK> and a dog running towards them as the <UNK> comes up living in new york city after 25 years in los angeles after growing up in a small town on the western side of new york state made me miss this kind of christmas while central park is beautiful after a first snow and the christmas tree at <UNK> center is too there is something about looking out at a snow covered field of trees and catch an occasional glimpse of deer <UNK> or other wild life br br this is a great holiday film that can also bring on the christmas spirit out of season and makes a great pairing with another barbara stanwyck country christmas film remember the night an underrated gem add on the big city christmas of meet john <UNK> and you've found perhaps one of the <UNK> stars of holiday films around
<START> why <UNK> petty was cast as tank girl i'll never know her acting performance is lack <UNK> her voice is grating it's almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie is br br there are several modern pop references in the film which i found to be very strange given that the movie was supposed to take place far in the future it wouldn't have been hard to make this premise interesting either some better writing would have helped loads br br <UNK> <UNK> makes an appearance in it as a mild mannered <UNK> geek i think they should have probably switched roles br br i'll never know why anyone would like this movie unless they were a petty fan br br try not to see this movie total waste of time
<START> an under appreciated unseen gem <UNK> does a remarkable job of <UNK> in poignant heartbreaking fashion the tension that <UNK> between a son who's been to hell and back and his parents who can't begin to understand the emotional <UNK> left behind it's not unlike born on the fourth of july in that it deals with a <UNK> emotional and mental breakdown after serving in vietnam but while that one focused more on the politics of post vietnam anti war speeches etc this one deals with a much more personal topic family one man's struggle to return to <UNK> after a life <UNK> experience and his parents' failure to see the change that has occurred br br <UNK> delivers a <UNK> performance as jeremy <UNK> you can sense the pain and frustration <UNK> beneath surface there to match him inch for inch is his real life father martin sheen it's a trip watching these two act off of each other as you get the sense that they're constantly trying to one up one another it's like the presence of each other inspired the pair to do their best and their performances triumph because of it br br recommended to anyone who <UNK> solid acting writing and directing and to any vietnam war buff br br 8 10
<START> i'm writing this note as a chess player as well as as a movie viewer i watched the 1997 <UNK> deep blue games on the internet i know something about the issues that were raised other chess players will come along and want to know whether this movie is worth seeing buying and i'm talking largely to them however i'll try not to ignore those who aren't into chess br br this movie is about the 1997 match between <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> built computer deep blue however the first image you see in the movie is not of <UNK> or of the computer but of the this is an <UNK> which was built in europe at the turn of the 18th 19th century and played winning chess against all <UNK> i put the word <UNK> in quotes because it was as everyone now knows a fake there was a man inside it br br if you don't like seeing the then you won't be able to stand the movie because the has as much screen time as <UNK> maybe more both in modern footage and in b w footage from some old movie the <UNK> of the every few seconds <UNK> charge that deep blue had human assistance that it was to some degree a fake computer that <UNK> cheated that there was a man inside it working behind the scenes to help it win not only does <UNK> believe this but the filmmakers seem to believe it too and so this is not really much of a movie about chess games or about programming chess computers it is a propaganda piece about a big corporation supposedly <UNK> a helpless <UNK> really it is a lot like a negative campaign ad as it is chock full of ominous music and <UNK> camera work and spooky sound effects and <UNK> we never found out what was behind that locked door and the ever present br br now most people in the chess community are pretty much convinced that <UNK> did not cheat and that this was paranoia at work to start with in order for a human to help deep blue beat <UNK> it would seem that you would need a human who was better than deep blue and better than <UNK> since there was no such person the whole idea is a bit suspect from the start furthermore by the time this movie was made there were computer programs that could run on your pc that could beat strong <UNK> today much more than in 1997 we take it for granted that a computer can do things you might not expect and we are less likely to take it as a monumental human tragedy that a computer beat a guy in chess and in fact the bottom line is that <UNK> beat himself with two bad mistakes including <UNK> game 2 in a drawn position br br as for the chess games you actually see very little of them there are a few comments from masters and <UNK> that tell briefly how they went but really you don't get to see hardly any of the <UNK> or tactics at all naturally as a chess player i take this as a major <UNK> but i think that non players are being cheated too imagine a baseball movie for example where you don't hardly get to see any of the game just a <UNK> telling you that in game four the white sox defeated the <UNK> with such and such a score nobody would make a movie like that but here for example we are told that <UNK> made a bad <UNK> in the opening of the <UNK> game 6 but we aren't shown the position on the screen or told why it was a <UNK> or what he should have done instead or anything we just see a few seconds of <UNK> holding his head in his hands and then more atmospheric sound effects and camera work br br since i saw this on dvd let me warn chess players about the dvd as well the jacket promises you that the extras include the games with analysis is this <UNK> analysis which people like us might find interesting no it is the <UNK> computer voice <UNK> analysis from some version of that tells you when a piece is attacked and a <UNK> gets isolated and that you are in the <UNK> defense main line br br someone might then come along and say well clearly this movie is meant to <UNK> the match for the non player and so it's unfair to be <UNK> with it but actually it doesn't do a very good job of reaching out to the non player either it <UNK> over some points that a true <UNK> would really want to have explained for example it says that <UNK> could have gotten <UNK> check in the second game but it doesn't explain what that is or show what it would have looked like on the board which would have been interesting it flashes back to the <UNK> matches but doesn't explain why there were two of them or who organized them etc i didn't need this information myself but i'm familiar with it if you don't already have chess experience there are places where you are going to be confused and this is just a <UNK> in the film br br ultimately i can't recommend the movie which like the itself is not what it <UNK> to be a documentary but more of a stage illusion
<START> <UNK> edge was one of the most disturbing films of 1986 and for a year that also saw blue <UNK> you know thats saying something viewed today its lost little of its power and remains much better than the overrated kids the previews for kids played it up to be an expose of the <UNK> of the <UNK> youth in reality it was little more than an exploitation film based mostly around shock value <UNK> edge was promoted as a teen exploitation flick but was in <UNK> much better the only times it goes from being disturbing to <UNK> is the constant image of the dead nude body outside of that the film is thought provoking and for all its minor flaws quite realistic br br keanu reeves known for being a particularly wooden performer gives his best performance as a burned out teenager <UNK> <UNK> is equally sympathetic and likable dennis hopper on the comeback trail with this blue <UNK> and <UNK> gives a great performance as the creepy yet pathetic hippie generation <UNK> <UNK> glover while always entertaining to watch seems a bit out of place as the manic <UNK> and leader of the group the best performance however is definitely daniel <UNK> as the murderer john <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> its a shame he didn't become a bigger star as hes a much better actor than reeves br br the film is overall fantastic and daring don't mistake this for another lame john hughes clich√©d high school flick such as the breakfast club this is a shocking piece of <UNK> that <UNK> with the viewer fans of this movie are advised to check out a canadian film from 1981 called out of the blue directed by dennis hopper its another shockingly bleak examination of the generation gap and despite its obscurity may have been an influence on <UNK> edge 7 10
<START> a bunch of medical student <UNK> get together in their spare time to hook each other to the <UNK> <UNK> and die then they stand around counting the time before brain death and then start <UNK> and heart <UNK> and bring each other back to life the fact that julia roberts was in this movie should say it all is like group ghost everyone wants to see their dead relatives and visit their old dead buddies so what better way to do it than have a bunch of medical students kill you for five minutes and then bring you back to life the rest of the movie has the predictable relationship issues plus the predictable gee maybe if we keep killing each other one of these days one of us will stay dead <UNK> this movie should have been called brain dead the fact that the characters were depicted as being medical students made me wonder if they had gone to a foreign <UNK> school to get their degrees the only thing that kept this film from being a total laugh was that they did not just stick their fingers into <UNK> <UNK> in order to die this film would have been a great three stooges comedy movie
<START> i saw the movie in original italian it must be said that the acting and interpretation is most heavily <UNK> by the tv generated trend to speak in a severely <UNK> voice not moving lips <UNK> tones as emerged in the that's real life productions and let's raise our audience with a few tears screen <UNK> the late <UNK> <UNK> towers upon the other characters for intensity clarity of expression and intellectual honesty the movie has some good hints but as in another comment before mine it lacks a <UNK> point and <UNK> away in many plot lets of lesser and lesser relevance another trend dragged in from the tv productions well known to italians a few drops in style could be <UNK> to the public such as the drag charm and <UNK> of cooking plus sensual of <UNK> see <UNK> <UNK> lunch etc and the <UNK> are definitely more truthful seems that <UNK> has learned the tune of italy in the early <UNK> and is <UNK> along i'll give him a last chance though
<START> as a huge fan of horror i had given up on the vampire sub genre due to the fact that in most vampire flicks the vampire has become feminine and non threatening <UNK> and basically weak this was the attitude i brought to a viewing of midnight and i am happy to say that the vampires in this film at least have the <UNK> to kill old ladies and sacrifice babies <UNK> <UNK> one of my favorite actors of all time was born to play the charming vampire with savage intensity br br another thing that interested me is that the central location is the hotel that is cool because and i went back to my high school copy to look this up in dracula the pass is where jonathan <UNK> must pass to get to <UNK> castle br br finally my hats off to whoever made the decision to make the creature a real effect and not a darn cgi that's the one thing great about many low budget movies they cannot afford the garbage computer effects that plague many hollywood <UNK> br br bottom line this is better than underworld for sure especially if you are a vampire <UNK> cheers <UNK>
<START> two page boys working at a radio network go from trying to solve murders to performing in black face in between work shifts jack <UNK> and sidney miller star in this <UNK> from 1945 lots of fast talking everybody yells at everybody and the two page boys call the police detective marty played by ralph <UNK> it's a real at <UNK> minutes and it has the feel of being adapted from a play since it mostly takes place in a radio station <UNK> we don't really care about any of the characters which is probably why its hardly ever shown no big deal this was phil second film as director we're not given any clues as to who might be knocking people off so we just kind of follow the police detective and the page boys as they all try to solve the mystery first i'll say no more so as not to give away any spoilers
<START> to the eight people who found the previous fierce people comments by me and helpful as well as to any future site <UNK> who see them before their authors <UNK> them these negative <UNK> are not only shorter than the site <UNK> <UNK> but they are entirely bogus incorrect and <UNK> for instance dad is in a coma not dead <UNK> and <UNK> even visit him in the hospital furthermore it was estate deer <UNK> not <UNK> who knocked up the maid etc etc so if you have add which makes you incapable of focusing on the <UNK> details please keep your condition to yourself by not pretending to be <UNK> or ebert otherwise include a <UNK> with your comments
<START> <UNK> is an odd and at times humorous low budget horror flick along the lines of or a less intelligent version of 'the good <UNK> br br set in a small <UNK> town three babies are born at the height of an <UNK> where <UNK> <UNK> means they are somehow born without emotions ten years later our three little <UNK> take themselves on a killing spree doing away with parents siblings teachers and anyone else who <UNK> them only one teenage girl knows the truth to be able to stop them there is no explanation for why babies across the world born at the same time aren't equally as twisted but there you go br br for a slasher film it's very tame in terms of violence and gore which i suppose highlights the problem of casting child characters as the killers as there is only so much you can expose the young actors to instead it's amusing and a little disturbing seeing three ten year olds plotting murders and carrying out their plans using guns knives and <UNK> the main reason why it doesn't <UNK> into being totally ridiculous is because the child actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they <UNK> play the little <UNK> in front of adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truth br br <UNK> is rather mediocre as a horror flick with few scares and little blood but because it has the shock factor of having kids as the killers it is a bit unique in that way one to watch if there's nothing else on
<START> i saw this film when it was released to the minor cinemas in the uk some 50 years ago and the memory remains of a great musical score and the tragedy of the storyline i saw it again on video recently the sound track was poor and the picture grainy but it is one of two films that i saw again the next day the other being gladiator the music theme is intensely tragic and from the outset one knows that it <UNK> failure or death certainly one of george sanders best performances as a man working the black market to get pay back for what he lost in the war but nemesis waits patricia <UNK> plays a <UNK> from eastern europe eaten with despair he is attracted to her <UNK> wants to help her and then falls in love with her but she is too proud and hurt to accept help their love destroys him and the girl and the doctor herbert marshall who brought the nemesis the storyline is of complex <UNK> <UNK> where <UNK> characters are not who they appear to be this is as a film which the critics and <UNK> at the box office but for the adolescent who saw it and the retired gentleman who saw it again it is one of the greatest films taking into account its age whose story is more akin to an opera
<START> <UNK> twelve is probably better than <UNK> eleven i know most people would disagree but i actually liked it more after three years it was good seeing the gang return the reason behind the heist is a bit more inspired the second time around i see why they stole from <UNK> andy garcia in the last film this film they have a bit more motivation the second time around <UNK> twelve is more entertaining and <UNK> than <UNK> eleven with a funny cameo by <UNK> grace saying i just walked in that new dennis quaid movie and other things i think <UNK> twelve is probably the best in the series br br the plot a year or so after <UNK> twelve terry <UNK> the guy they robbed in the last film is back and says that if <UNK> eleven doesn't pay him back the money they stole he's going to call the cops so danny ocean and the gang go to europe where rusty meets his old cop girlfriend isabelle after she meets him again she begins to follow them around also the gang learns that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are br br with many funny scenes like when tess julia roberts goes to europe and pretends to be julia roberts <UNK> twelve is a pretty clever film it's <UNK> funnier and more entertaining than <UNK> eleven

<START> fat girls is among the worst films within the indie gay genre br br the premise is promising an average looking gay teen is trapped in a <UNK> small <UNK> town his only <UNK> spirits are the other village <UNK> <UNK> the class <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> immigrant from cuba and the sensitive drama teacher so far interesting in theory this plot line creates a decent setup for an appealing coming of age story with a built in audience the thousands of gay men who grew up in small towns across america and experienced this adolescent anxiety first hand <UNK> with a dose of self <UNK> humor br br unfortunately rather than a nuanced <UNK> ash christian approaches his <UNK> subject matter with a poorly executed attempt at irony and dark humor the result is a cast of unlikeable derivative two dimensional characters which the viewer cannot but help feel indifferent toward sabrina <UNK> is a quasi <UNK> bitter <UNK> she is such a <UNK> unsympathetic person there is little doubt as to the reason for her <UNK> condition the chemistry between her and rodney christian <UNK> zero this may have been bad casting but is more likely due to a screenplay which is simply consequently one is left wondering when there is such a non existent bond what could possibly warrant their near constant <UNK> throughout the story br br <UNK> <UNK> boyfriend <UNK> de jesus and <UNK> mother judy are among the most exaggerated of the clich√©d stock characters ripped off from dozens of other films <UNK> is the horny immigrant nerd lifted directly from every raunchy adolescent comedy ever made within the realm of tv or film judy is the born again obsessed with jesus talk and big hair just when you thought the <UNK> faye thing had been done to death christian <UNK> a scene where <UNK> <UNK> is running with her tears is there anyone in the <UNK> world that can possibly think this tired old stereotype gag is still funny after seeing it ad <UNK> for 20 years br br in addition to the failed attempts at <UNK> humor there are many puzzling story inconsistencies rodney considers himself a fat ugly loser however he simultaneously manages to participate in casual and regular <UNK> <UNK> with the <UNK> school jock hunk ted miller although these <UNK> are devoid of emotional <UNK> most gay teens filled with raging <UNK> just like their <UNK> <UNK> would find this to be a rather <UNK> <UNK> given the more common alternative of <UNK> <UNK> br br rodney finds an object for his affection in bobby an exotic transplant from england against all believable odds the <UNK> not only happens to land in this tiny <UNK> hamlet but is conveniently openly gay to boot like sabrina bobby is an icy angry smart <UNK> and the viewer is left head scratching as to his <UNK> appeal br br much to his delight rodney is invited by his new crush to the town gay bar where bobby claims to be the dj upon arrival the boyfriend to be promptly leaves rodney solo and heads off to another area of the bar for a quick encounter with a rather handsome young man this is yet one more of the ridiculously inexplicable plot elements since <UNK> feeling as an <UNK> are supposedly derived largely from his lonely existence in a <UNK> town as tiny as the town is they have openly gay students at the high school a secretly <UNK> football captain lesbian <UNK> a gay teacher and it has a gay bar downtown by attractive men no less apparently the place is not so <UNK> after all br br ten years earlier todd edge of <UNK> covered nearly the same material with a much more creative honest touching and humorous film
<START> i saw this movie when i was very young it is my all time favorite i had been unable to obtain a copy until recently and viewing it brought back so many fond memories i loved sidney portrayal of he his character with such strength and courage pearl <UNK> part although small was not unlike many of our own family members my favorite songs were and still are <UNK> you is my women don't let him handle me and of course <UNK> according to the <UNK> if i'm <UNK> them correctly i'm unable to post where i was able to obtain my copy sorry that is why i <UNK> so that i might be able to share this info before <UNK> the <UNK> are not posted br br phone numbers mail <UNK> <UNK> price or <UNK> <UNK> information
<START> like the above poster i got burned on the title thinking i was getting the other <UNK> this movie is everything the above poster said and worse br br poor camera lousy acting and just plain horrid storyline br br there was very little here that was even worth watching how this movie even got released is beyond me br br make sure the movie you buy is the one you want and not this one br br the movie i bought was labeled <UNK> and not <UNK> <UNK> which is what it actually is this is the only way they sold this movie at all br br peace out
<START> this is a very enjoyable <UNK> glamorous musical from the 40's <UNK> made rita hayworth <UNK> the dark haired latin <UNK> <UNK> into a <UNK> <UNK> all american star it confirmed gene kelly's amazing talent as a dancer singer actor and choreographer it <UNK> the <UNK> and colour of the musical genre br br rita hayworth is great as rusty parker it is her picture and her presence is always at the <UNK> her singing is dubbed but her dancing is absolutely brilliant and she combines very well with kelly i think that rita was highly underrated as an actress she plays every scene superbly here gene choreographed the dance sequences he was basically given almost complete creative freedom here and his <UNK> dance number is amazing such artistry the stand out tunes are <UNK> way for <UNK> <UNK> me to the and of course <UNK> ago and far <UNK> the plot is rather thin yet it does have a moral it's about the <UNK> of quick fame and fast money and how any happiness with only these factors will ultimately be doomed this will cheer you up lift you up to your feet and make you laugh br br that said <UNK> is not the greatest musical ever produced it has a number of flaws that must be addressed one can say that a little bit of phil <UNK> goes a long way his character gets tedious rather quickly however i was impressed with his dancing ability and how he was able to keep up with gene and rita another major problem is that too many songs are just not that great the <UNK> number looks fantastic but i'm not a fan of the lyrics or the singing <UNK> is a huge <UNK> i think it's one of the worst numbers i've heard in a 40's 50's musical yet it stinks the grandmother sub plot borders on being ridiculous but that's only my opinion others may like these elements br br still apart from it's faults it's a very very good film much better than most of the product <UNK> out today the dancing and singing is sublime the production values are excellent and it's mood is <UNK> br br 8 10
<START> john <UNK> is a great comedian and <UNK> every time this has been on hbo i've had to stop and watch it john tells the story of how he grew up probably some fact and fiction and adds hilarious stories in the midst if you like john's comedy i would have to say this is probably his comedy at his best
<START> i am fifteen years old and have seen thirty three of sinatra's films not counting videos of tv shows and documentaries and have been <UNK> by only two of them the clouds roll by and the miracle of the <UNK> don't really count however considering that in the first all he does is sing a magnificent ol' man river and in the latter he's not half bad only the picture is pathetic my favorite records radio shows tv shows and movies concerning sinatra change virtually every day everything taking on a different <UNK> at each viewing and occasionally seeming the best thing he ever did and occasionally the worst until the cycle comes around again but there are a couple things that are beyond comparison when it comes to movies the man with the golden arm heads that list everybody who knows anything about sinatra knows he thought this was his best ever performance he was oscar nominated it was the first serious look at drug addiction etc etc the jazz score is unforgettable kim <UNK> likable despite a ludicrous accent <UNK> parker is annoying and <UNK> too dramatic the turtle like arnold is amusing the first time but more embarrassing every time out and darren <UNK> makes a wonderfully slimy drug dealer the sets are unconvincing at first glance it seems a peculiar mixed bag tossed together by the great otto preminger with an off center charm br br then you come to sinatra like everything else in his life other than music reports of his acting are <UNK> divided in half directors like fred <UNK> frank <UNK> billy wilder stanley kramer martin scorsese peter bogdanovich and otto preminger all agreed that had sinatra worked as hard on his films as he did on singing he'd have been among the greatest actors in the world if not the greatest <UNK> bogart even said this guy has the most natural acting talent i've ever seen not bad for a man who never took an acting lesson in his life was at the same time producing the <UNK> that would make him the greatest singer of the 20th century and did almost all his scenes in one take br br in direct conflict with all of this are those other reviews and <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> about what a lousy actor was this mr sinatra and how many bad movies he made the question will never be answered to everyone's satisfaction because controversy was among sinatra's greatest <UNK> and both arguments were in a sense playing into his hand in any case at this time in this role sinatra is magnificent a reviewer said in the late fifties sinatra may not be the greatest actor in the world but there is none more fascinating to watch no matter what sinatra is doing in a film it's hard to take your eyes off him this of course is a charisma that i've only seen in a handful of other people orson welles richard burton marlon brando <UNK> <UNK> perhaps james cagney there's no real definition for it and it often makes it hard to figure out whether you're really enjoying a performance or just <UNK> but that quality on display here is what makes the movie sinatra is downright riveting real intense <UNK> decades and thousands of paper doll pop stars with something called quality like it or not this is a one man show with a few character actors hanging around in the background he covers every emotion with remarkable subtlety from sweet lonely <UNK> with kim novak to the terrifying shock of frank sinatra frank sinatra <UNK> and screaming in the agony of cold turkey sinatra was right this is his best performance no question br br i was eight when frank sinatra died i wasn't around for all the years of bobby <UNK> and aweigh <UNK> mr <UNK> <UNK> and here to eternity albums with <UNK> <UNK> and lovers kennedy vegas ring a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> and reagan and <UNK> from madison square garden to south africa to the white house to the <UNK> i can't say i like sinatra because i heard him at the paramount or because i hear september of my years the usual excuses and my excuse when i was eleven i watched a movie called on the town
<START> i saw this movie years ago and i never forgot it the theme is very <UNK> it was on tcm this morning and i am wondering why this wonderful film is not on vhs or dvd i have searched <UNK> for this movie but cannot find it i believe that if enough people request it the movie will ultimately be put on dvd it <UNK> me that such a stunning performance from quinn and such a powerful plot is not yet available to the public the fact that ethnic <UNK> exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must see for teachers and students alike this film is a great teaching tool from the past yet in many ways as contemporary as crash from previous comments i can see that this film as made deep impressions on everyone again too bad it is not available for sale
<START> <UNK> the magic the terror the slight boredom br br that <UNK> is for acquired tastes goes without saying you don't just happen to watch it unless your friends are real art house movie buffs you must dig the weird the macabre the bizarre you must dig cool flicks and you must dig to find <UNK> br br <UNK> is one of the most visually dazzling and <UNK> films ever known to man the visual part is something to behold something no one can prepare you for but since the film is devoid of any type of dialogue the visual part is pretty much the only part <UNK> is a visual film the created for the film are magical and groundbreaking but still the sight of it br br god commits suicide in a particularly gory scene then from his corpse rises mother earth who <UNK> herself with god's <UNK> and gives birth to flesh on bone a retarded child she then <UNK> him and he gets tortured by <UNK> like creatures mother comes back to save him but she and her son get murdered by the horrible creatures br br the film is about the <UNK> of life and about the fact that we come to this planet to suffer and to die and that when something dies something else is born etc <UNK> br br the film's no 1 quality is of course the visuals the setting those haunting images this other <UNK> quality after you're done watching you feel like an alien it's that mesmerizing br br when people say it should last instead of <UNK> they're right no they're not it could last it's just that everything happens to such a slow pace in fact the plot summary i provided is all that happens in the film like no kidding still it's i don't know glorious br br like a flame burning away the darkness
<START> are you kidding me the music was so loud in this show i could often not even hear the dialog and the music was nothing great anyone know what <UNK> mother said when he walked in the door and the <UNK> cloud looked pretty close to have so little instant <UNK> anyone research the effects of nuclear <UNK> before writing this one i felt like a bunch of sit com actors were sent on location and didn't know what to do with dramatic dialog and what does a kansas teen know about shopping in <UNK> couldn't we have had a better line here was bored to tears and only kept awake by the jarring <UNK> of the over mixed way to loud music
<START> the claude <UNK> movie is a pretty good moment of cinema one of the most touching films about family and loneliness and surely the best interpretation of french actor jean paul <UNK>
<START> after watching stop loss i find myself against disappointed in hollywood for making such a stinker gone are the days of glory of the films of the 1940's that made one proud to be an american fighting the <UNK> that desires conquest abroad and death at home what we are left with is <UNK> <UNK> at the mouth of <UNK> anti bush <UNK> the story tells of three young men who return home from the war one <UNK> into out of control madness culminating in his death the main protagonist <UNK> his country at a time of war and destroys his best friends relationship with his fianc√© at the same time the third truly is the hero of the story <UNK> to continue the fight that was brought to our <UNK> nearly eight years ago what makes this movie bad is not the acting but the premise behind it we are lead to believe that <UNK> soldiers are in fact <UNK> of our country <UNK> is akin to <UNK> in a time of war and the main protagonist <UNK> with it throughout the movie this <UNK> is designed to <UNK> the audience's reaction to the central act of the movie we are not supposed to find fault with king since he wears <UNK> but his actions don't just merit it but cry out for it he is not an anti hero in order to accept the movie the audience must accept the correctness of <UNK> because the story paints king as nothing else short of a hero i cannot accept that since it is like asking me to call the sky yellow on a clear blue day furthermore <UNK> for the real hero is <UNK> upon the man who re <UNK> and continues to serve his country i would only recommend this stinker to someone who needs convincing of the <UNK> of hollywood as it is a clear example of it no wonder it <UNK> poorly in the box office
<START> the <UNK> was written and directed by brendan <UNK> in what appears to be an attempt to pull the mysteries of the charles <UNK> novels into a contemporary story but that attempt is <UNK> by <UNK> to use the two periods of time format in which the is <UNK> despite a cast of well known actors trying their best to pull off this direct to dvd movie the end product is a long tedious amateurish mess that can only be considered as entertainment if viewers are fans of the cast as remembered from other films br br mike sullivan <UNK> jones is a journalist confined to <UNK> on dog racing events while he dreams of important <UNK> <UNK> a series of similar murders happens to include an old friend of <UNK> <UNK> vera day who runs a pub on the banks of the <UNK> having just discovered an old valuable <UNK> <UNK> by charles dickens and has a heart of gold giving <UNK> away to such pathetic creatures as an old tramp <UNK> derek <UNK> <UNK> murder <UNK> mike to the role of detective <UNK> and with the help of <UNK> kate julie cox he begins to tie the investigation to clues he finds in reading the dickens <UNK> <UNK> the flow of this rather simplistic story is the use of flashbacks to <UNK> time as dickens again derek <UNK> <UNK> a rather personal story of peculiar murders the parallel between stories and the cross casting among actors may have worked in <UNK> hands but the <UNK> of this kind of venture escapes writer director brendan <UNK> he draws his story to a close at long last with a tired ending br br in addition to jones <UNK> cox and day the film somehow attracted the attention of vanessa redgrave jason <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and mel smith their <UNK> are minimal but happily distracting this is a flimsy bit of <UNK> leaving the viewer wondering how films of this quality ever find funding grady <UNK>
<START> two <UNK> <UNK> are traveling through the amazon river <UNK> on their latest assignment while trying to capture the <UNK> of the area on film our <UNK> cross paths with a game hunter who is stalking the animals for another reason looking to eliminate the witnesses to his illegal activities the hunter decides according to the dvd <UNK> synopsis br br handsome guide peter brown as jim takes pretty blonde <UNK> as terry greene and her good looking brother tom as art greene into the <UNK> jungle to admire the view and take <UNK> pictures after they hook up with hunky big game hunter william smith as psychological <UNK> surface br br a pivotal scene with mr brown in the <UNK> of a tree and sharing a cigarette with mr is nicely staged the <UNK> direction <UNK> in the later fight between brown and mr smith and it is effective early sex romp adds nothing to the story it could have been cut to take advantage of what seems like <UNK> between the brown and characters an attraction between brown and ms <UNK> could have been played up also br br the music including jim <UNK> love all things that love the sun is fine but the film needs to be re <UNK> to cut out animals which do not appear on screen and there is far too much superfluous footage on display <UNK> is a case where less would have been more
<START> <UNK> <UNK> puppet master only with scary parts was the most recent korean horror flick i had the pleasure of watching with the title of in asia this movie struck me immediately when i saw it reviewed online with images that made me think of puppet master <UNK> play and other toy doll based horror flicks in the past but for some reason i didn't think boy this will be tacky i imagined it would be creepy and fun horror done well almost br br the movie starts slowly but i like that so it was fine the score almost like i found with was beautiful and very much reminded me of classic horror scores of the past i wont give much away but the story was strong in this one and i would highly recommend it to any fan of asian horror it isn't extreme it isn't to be taken with <UNK> seriousness but it is really good
<START> <UNK> is sent in his cage on a train by his old lady owner in the same <UNK> car also in a cage is <UNK> br br in no time <UNK> has grabbed <UNK> but a comes back and <UNK> the <UNK> as he calls him back in his cage he puts <UNK> in a <UNK> place up high and tells the cat now remember no tricks <UNK> puts his <UNK> on and looks innocent yeah right br br i found the funniest stuff however didn't involve <UNK> versus <UNK> but the dog that is in another cage next to <UNK> the cat gets <UNK> with him and pays a big price in an extremely funny manner <UNK> just doesn't learn but that's one reason we love him i know a number of imdb reviewers don't like <UNK> but i like both main characters they both crack me up br br also the train and the passing scenery is beautifully illustrated in here really nice visuals
<START> the end of <UNK> is a very useful film it's also important and provocative there seems to be no middle ground with either the film or its main source of entertainment the anti <UNK> <UNK> james howard br br while i am not a big fan of the new my criticism of it is because of its small vision in the case of new peter another talking head you finally hear what's somewhat obvious in and amongst the special added out takes just doesn't understand peak oil br br i've used this as a teaching tool in <UNK> classes to get at the importance of land as a factor of production a fact long <UNK> by <UNK> and also as a vehicle for <UNK> about peak oil our <UNK> land use global warming our threatened food production public <UNK> our <UNK> future br br move over south park made by <UNK> from toronto for 25 000 and released in may 2004 this video sold over 24 000 copies by october 2005 one major dvd rental <UNK> recently ordered almost 400 more copies br br the end of <UNK> sales were actually climbing 1 1 2 years after its release and it has also been available on one of the major online video services since september 2005 br br a sequel escape from <UNK> is in the works with a possible release by august 2006
<START> over the last few months i have seen a lot of reviews for the italian job many of them negative the <UNK> of almost all of these <UNK> criticisms is that for all its <UNK> <UNK> and high budget technology the film doesn't have much substance where it counts look people it's just a fun movie this is the type of picture where you're supposed to sit back relax and just enjoy the steady moving pace of the film like <UNK> eleven 2001 you can concentrate on the characters and the plot at the same time without having to do much thinking lucky for some of us granted ocean is a better movie but who cares the plot may have some holes there's a huge one about 3 4 of the way through the action may not be as gratuitous as the trailers made it out to be and some of the dialogue may seem pointless and cheesy but again who really cares cool characters mini <UNK> big explosions <UNK> <UNK> what more do you want i think it's time to drop the fake roger ebert meets gene act and enjoy yourself for once oh and another thing whatever you do don't compare it to the original because to <UNK> what f gary gray has told the press a million times this is not a remake my advice if you're interested in <UNK> picking your way through a good <UNK> fun flick don't even bother seeing the italian job but if you don't have a severe <UNK> complex and or want to see ed norton get <UNK> by a bunch of go ahead the bottom line my fellow <UNK> is <UNK> up and have fun <UNK>
<START> okay if you <UNK> the production value the ugly outfits and the big hair this adaptation is still far inferior to the 90's version first ann playing anne elliot is literally ten years too old to play this role and her acting leaves much to be desired amanda root playing the same role in the 90's version can express more in her big brown eyes than can with her entire face in a four hour production anne is turned into a <UNK> whining boring character and what was with the scene during the long where she stops to <UNK> off poetry <UNK> and <UNK> looked so much alike that the only time i could tell them apart was when they stood next to each other <UNK> was <UNK> and <UNK> never was there a more obnoxious character it was ridiculous to think that <UNK> was supposed to be interested in her she is supposed to be high spirited and pretty and charming not stupid and silly with her ridiculous laugh that's like nails on a <UNK> when she starts to <UNK> to to to ' i started yelling shut up shut up shut up ' the best part of the movie was when <UNK> falls those three feet at the <UNK> because i knew i wouldn't have to see her anymore in the movie speaking of the fall at the <UNK> scene it was the poorly acted badly directed and edited scene of the entire film how does a person fall three feet down land on her feet and still be knocked unconscious br br on the plus size the character of elizabeth was much closer to the book than in the 90's version they also put in many more scenes with anne and <UNK> at the end br br i'll admit i have bought this movie even though i knew how sub par it was but i'm a huge austen fan so i'll buy any movie adapted from one of her novels watch this move if you're <UNK> curious or to appreciate the 90's version even more br br the bottom line is this version may follow the letter of the novel but the 90's version follows the spirit
<START> this is good movie that is flawed in many ways with low production martha <UNK> herself said she only had <UNK> 000 dollars to work with this is a movie that i loved growing up in the <UNK> i remember friends and i having the nostalgia trip on this movie 10 years ago great things about this movie great cast with hungry actors and a hungry director bad points of this movie to small of a budget calling for way too much <UNK> if martha <UNK> had been given more money and time on this movie then the results would of been even better they should have taken the story from an early <UNK> <UNK> and not from a 15 17 year old high school stand point most of the actors actresses were in their early to mid <UNK> trying to play 15 17 year olds come on the music is extremely memorable and the two <UNK> get played all the time in my car the best scenes in this film take place in seedy hollywood <UNK> by nicolas <UNK> character i gave this film a high rating of 9 10 for five reasons nicholas <UNK> <UNK> on the spot acting the camera work and angles are excellent given the budget they had and only being able to have one take of each scene the music and <UNK> are captured perfectly and forever again the music is incredible and carries the story along from scene to scene and finally martha <UNK> could turn a weak script unknown actors and a very very low budget and 20 days of shooting the entire movie into such a good and memorable movie is astounding
<START> this was without a doubt the worst movie i have ever see yet once i started it was just like the really bad car wreck on the side of the road you can't help yourself you just have to look my eyes the acting was awful the production was awful the filming was awful awful awful awful i was glad the priest got chopped would have loved to have done it myself because of his poor acting i mean suck acting to the <UNK> power i would have <UNK> if chris had just <UNK> the lot of them before turning it on himself and what was with that freaking wig from hell on his head i sincerely hope no one got paid i mean if getting paid were to be considered here they should be paid to never attempt another film project again everyone that was involved never never again that was just a huge piece of garbage that i am embarrassed to say i just had to keep watching until the very end don't watch it it's about an hour and a half of your life you will never get back and then you'll have to spend time <UNK> on this website so you can write a comment like i am doing now which you must do as a <UNK> in order to survive the of having viewed this film and i use the term film loosely here
<START> don't be fooled by the plot out line as it is described on the cover at least the swedish version the story on this seems rather interesting with <UNK> hints nothing can be further from the truth this is the absolute most sad movie experience i've ever had it is plain and right awful and should not be sold or rented to anyone if you still think the plot seems intriguing reflect on this <UNK> can move run and kill people as can also any other electric <UNK> it can throw things at you haunt you and run after you please do not watch this movie it is a disgrace for the horror genre
<START> let's see this movie is many things to different people to <UNK> as shown by the comments it can be ok or dreadful or boring to other folks it can be something different first off if you do not speak <UNK> i do you will understand half of what is going on as subtitles are dreadful and even the title is translated <UNK> <UNK> would probably be translated as <UNK> in uk english br br why did i not like it because it is a tarantino style movie it simply takes a very harsh reality and throws it back at you as brutally as possible i however am not american and thus i am not particularly fond of this <UNK> because all it does is show that the director has really nothing new to say technical <UNK> camera work is brilliant script not that unoriginal do not rescue this movie from the bottom where it belongs should you wish to see a <UNK> movie then go for any of the <UNK> movie who match talent and directorial skill with very good actresses and actors br br this director ought to review his intention and <UNK> none was <UNK> and thus this film failed by not watching it you won't miss much
<START> man i remember this show with nostalgic i really <UNK> because he wasn't the conventional hero he was more than a futuristic texas cowboy the man had the <UNK> of a bear the vision of a walk and the <UNK> of a i can't remember that one br br the action sequences were great i remember that would always use his <UNK> named translated to spanish anytime he was in big troubles br br this was a quality action cartoon i loved the characters the dialogs the music and of course the opening credits sequence long live to him a cult classic in my opinion and a must see
<START> the 3 stars are for phillip seymour hoffman nothing else and no one else in this movie deserves even a wee <UNK> of a star well ok amy adams deserves a wee <UNK> but the doesn't seem to be working so i'll stick with 3 tom hanks nothing julia roberts nothing mike <UNK> do you see a trend yet aaron <UNK> not a chance br br i could rant on for several <UNK> about the way charlie <UNK> war <UNK> over history morality <UNK> and so on but i don't think any such rant could <UNK> the <UNK> of aaron fans the rest of you beware spend your movie money elsewhere br br still if you're looking for a <UNK> comment here's mine you can put hot <UNK> <UNK> on a pile of garbage but it changes nothing garbage is garbage and so is charlie <UNK> war
<START> karen and her boyfriend jerry move into their new los angeles apartment they discover an old <UNK> bed that karen takes a liking to unfortunately it has a really sinister history involving kinky sex murders <UNK> tries to be a creepy supernatural tale but fails miserably the action is slow the acting is nothing special and there is no suspense whatsoever even the sex scenes are lame the climax is pretty gory and violent so fans of splatter should be pleased however the first hour of <UNK> is deadly dull and offers some tired horror movie conventions and cheap scares definitely one to avoid my rating 4 out of 10 and that's being generous watch re animator or castle freak instead
<START> i would recommend this for anyone who is an admirer of the late john cassavetes and for those who have never known of cassavetes it is an excellent film i really don't have the time to go into the details of why this is my opinion but if you're looking for something <UNK> with lots of scenes to <UNK> over then this one is for you the cinematography is perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of the film as well as the story itself this review does not do the film justice it is an experience one must view for themselves lots of character very genuine
<START> this is one of the worst films i've ever seen don't watch it even if your life depends on it br br this laurel and hardy film is when they <UNK> an island become <UNK> and are set to be hung an incredibly boring film that is no where near funny br br this was the last laurel and hardy film and what a very low note to end such a superb career the 40's films weren't great this film was made in 1950 if you want to remember laurel and hardy remember them in their prime the 1930's the short talking films are better than the feature length films my favourite is me and my pal another reason this film is awful is because it's dubbed the actor opens there mouth and the words come out three days later crap but let's end on a high note laurel and hardy have been in my opinion the best double act ever
<START> slaughter trail is a b western with some grand <UNK> but it's come down in hollywood history for a most <UNK> reason br br watching this film with it's musical score which can only be described as overbearing i have a feeling what howard hughes was trying to do is <UNK> a singing cowboy for rko films they already had tim holt who was as reliable a b picture cowboy hero there ever was but he was not a singer i guess hughes saw what money herbert j <UNK> was <UNK> in with roy rogers over at republic and decided he'd get one as well br br so terry who was a very good performer and much better song writer got <UNK> and sang some of his material which was not his best and worse looked like they were <UNK> into the picture but worse than that there's this annoying chorus which sang a lot of the story and frankly overwhelmed the actors extras even the horses needless to say terry never got to be a singing cowboy but he did write such classics as the bare <UNK> and dean <UNK> great hit memories are made of this br br the plot concerns an inside woman on a <UNK> jewel robbery that's right the <UNK> who are gig young <UNK> <UNK> and ken plant virginia grey in the coach as a passenger which they receive word is carrying some valuable <UNK> br br it's a great act grey and young pull off young takes her away from the coach to presumably a fate worse than death and they do properly act out the scene within <UNK> of the passengers but what he does is slip her the <UNK> last place the authorities might look if she doesn't run off with it br br but when they flee the robbery it's on tired horses so they stop at a cabin to take some replacement <UNK> and shoot three <UNK> who object that puts the <UNK> back on the <UNK> didn't help that one of the <UNK> was chief <UNK> <UNK> brother br br that's the situation that captain brian <UNK> at the <UNK> has to deal with when the coach and the <UNK> arrive there for protection how it all works out is predictable but in a <UNK> sort of <UNK> way br br in fact that's the problem with slaughter trail it's a simple no <UNK> b western that got <UNK> up into something almost grotesque br br but the real reason slaughter trail entered into history is that this film apparently marks the official beginning of the <UNK> originally howard <UNK> was to play part and may have in fact completed his scenes when howard hughes officially fired him for communist <UNK> his scenes were completely re shot with brian <UNK> in the lead br br considering what a fiasco this film turned into i'm not sure whether <UNK> or <UNK> ought to have <UNK> hughes or kicked him in his private <UNK>
<START> i have seen this film at least 100 times and i am still excited by it the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat plus i still think bryan brown is the tops brilliant film
<START> this is one of my all time favourites all the actors do a great job comparing this movie to lawrence of <UNK> does no justice to both movies the wind and the lion levels a much lower budget with fantastic actors portraying heartwarming characters in a heartwarming atmosphere action and beautiful pictures are provided as well which all together <UNK> a favourite movie to me
<START> a young man named danny has run away from home and meets a drifter named who agrees to tag along with danny and watch out for him and his money they end up in a small town where they meet carrie a shy naive girl working in her father's diner starts seeing carrie but he plans on leaving soon because he's a drifter see he's no good understand meanwhile the town creep jesse played by a perfectly casted jack <UNK> keeps showing up at the diner and bothering carrie danny keeps inadvertently picking up <UNK> left and right because he's loaded with money ¬ñ he has almost a hundred dollars whom has to constantly chase away there are a lot of <UNK> gay overtones between danny and in this flick eventually and danny decide to leave town but trouble is a <UNK> due to jesse the creep br br my review of the movie itself a terrible dated troubled youth flick from the <UNK> br br my review of the mst3k version of the movie i've got to say that this is one of the best episodes of mst3k ever the <UNK> is dead on all the time except for the somewhat downbeat ending this movie is easy material for joel and the <UNK> especially <UNK> constant screw ups that has to rescue him from the host segments are pretty good too especially the segment with the train song ' hopefully <UNK> releases this episode to home video one day
<START> in world war ii a badly burned <UNK> known only as the english patient is found in the african desert and is transported to italy where he joins a <UNK> of medical troops and others at an abandoned monastery among them are <UNK> juliette <UNK> a canadian nurse whose lovers generally meet unpleasant ends <UNK> andrews and hardy kevin <UNK> two <UNK> experts who search the monastery for bombs and david <UNK> willem dafoe a canadian soldier of fortune who knows the identity of the english patient and has a score to settle br br through flashbacks we learn the story of the patient he is ralph <UNK> a hungarian <UNK> who in the late <UNK> falls in with a group of british including geoffrey <UNK> colin <UNK> and his wife <UNK> <UNK> scott thomas while <UNK> the <UNK> of north africa after <UNK> leaves them on government business <UNK> and <UNK> fall in love with each other in the desert resulting in an affair that naturally has a less than happy ending br br if one is able to overlook the illogical parts of the story line such as why would a patient found in africa be sent to what is essentially the front line of the war in italy then you can appreciate the english patient as a <UNK> to the intelligent layered sweeping epics of david lean in the '60s much more than titanic or other epic romances of late this movie puts one in mind of doctor <UNK> and gone with the wind an epic love story set against a huge historical backdrop you shouldn't expect a war film though there are some striking if all too brief scenes of violence that stand out more than the romantic sections as is usually the case <UNK> by a sadistic ss officer <UNK> <UNK> in particular br br the movie is very ambiguous in regards to pretty much everything the central question of the film is how far are you willing to go for love as critics of the movie are fast to point out is on the surface a far from likable character he has an affair with a married woman and betrays his country by giving <UNK> and intelligence to the germans causing the death of his friend julian and the torture of <UNK> and actually killing a british soldier who has him under arrest at one point the fact that is in many ways <UNK> is kind of the point he's in love with <UNK> and sees the world <UNK> in terms of his love that loyalty to country or anything else for that matter is secondary as says he hates <UNK> being owned the two engage in a rather bold love affair <UNK> within ear shot of hundreds of people at a christmas party and it's clear that <UNK> is more drawn to the mysterious exciting than the <UNK> boring geoffrey br br the 1944 subplot is somewhat shaky and seems superfluous the romance between <UNK> and hannah is never completely believable and i feel the film could have done without it but those sequences do add an interesting <UNK> of mystery and complexity to the film so i won't complain too much br br like the epics mentioned above the film is able to convey time and place through simple devices like crowd scenes <UNK> placed posters and military presence we do not need to <UNK> on the fact that it's 1938 in <UNK> but it's helpful to know the direction of anthony and the desert cinematography by john are absolutely gorgeous the sand <UNK> sand <UNK> and haunting <UNK> of the desert are captured in beautiful detail gabriel score is haunting and atmospheric br br the acting is generally solid <UNK> gives a very layered performance as a character who is mysterious complex and haunted the difference between the of 1938 and 1944 are remarkable one exciting and somewhat <UNK> the other haunted and <UNK> kirsten scott thomas is effective as <UNK> the female <UNK> looking for adventure and colin <UNK> gives one of his best performances as geoffrey who realizes early on that he's no competition for the exciting willem dafoe does nice work as <UNK> the <UNK> hunted thief turned spy driven by revenge <UNK> <UNK> gives a performance reminiscent of jose <UNK> in lawrence of <UNK> and a similar character too very brief but more memorable then some of the major characters some of the 1944 actors are <UNK> juliette is nothing special while andrews is good but <UNK> kevin <UNK> as <UNK> ill <UNK> partner does what he can with a rather role br br the english patient is not a perfect movie by any means but the attacks on it by much of the movie going public are not deserved at all maybe it's a show of how film sensibilities have changed since the era of the <UNK> and <UNK> or maybe people were expecting something simple to understand complex to fault brilliantly directed and shot the english patient is a wonderful modern day epic br br 8 10
<START> the artist daniel king chris john and his mate laura peters lara <UNK> are invited to move to an old house in <UNK> in great britain by his childhood wealthy friend natasha <UNK> carol natasha has a crush on daniel who is an ambiguous man regarding his sentimental life while alone in the house weird things happen and laura is <UNK> and scared when laura meets the old insane priest gabriel norton brian blessed on the road she is advised to immediately leave the house since evil lived there but the couple stays and has to face tragic consequences br br what a messy screenplay and awful and cheesy movie this devil's <UNK> is the cinematography and the camera work is not totally bad but the amateurish performances of chris john and carol and direction of james <UNK> together with the terrible story ridiculous situations and dialogs make this movie one of the worse i have ever seen in the genre i have occasionally seen in youtube a couple of shorts from cinema college that are better and better than the pointless and dreadful devil's <UNK> in the end it is not a horror movie but a horror of movie my vote is three br br title brazil a do <UNK> the devil's <UNK>
<START> this was indeed an amazing adaption i missed the first episode so i unfortunately missed out on the bonding between the characters and the smooth flow of the storyline but as soon i watched the second and then the third <UNK> i was just blown away i ordered the dvd less than a week later and unable to wait for it to come i went straight out and brought the book from the moment i opened it i was hooked i just couldn't put it down i decided to finish the whole book before i dare watch the dvd at all i preferred the book because it got inside the characters minds you could understand totally where they were coming from and what there role was within the story they missed a lot out of the adaption which was disappointing as the book is a master piece and i think they could have done it superbly if they had been able to stretch it over a longer period of time but considering only being able to be <UNK> into a 3 hour <UNK> i think it was done excellent it followed the main twisted storyline brilliantly and the actors which were <UNK> as the main characters where amazing the love making scene was pure beautiful it was so tender and loving and just showed how natural homosexual love can be i was totally blown away with both the book and the tv adaption i loved both of sarah waters previous novels and also found the <UNK> the <UNK> adaption quite enjoyable but when i read and watched i knew none of her previous novels adaption could beat it sarah waters has indeed <UNK> herself this time i recommend that you watch this adaption if <UNK> the <UNK> wasn't your thing then don't let it put you off this one is a whole new ball game it is a beautiful yet dark twisted story about love greed and betrayal br br a must see
<START> i went into this film thinking i wasn't going to like it but hoping to be surprised but this much like the film ended up being bleak and hopeless but don't get me wrong delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion the acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a <UNK> of oscar <UNK> for law kidman and <UNK> even though <UNK> few scenes may be the most powerful in the film the locations are beautiful and has an eye for a good shot br br however for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to and his adaptation the film is so utterly bleak it makes for what i consider to be a <UNK> bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film i didn't have the time to emotionally <UNK> or hadn't <UNK> from a previous blow and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care not to mention predictable overall the cold mountain almost left me too <UNK> to even think back on the good aspects of the film as all i remember is death which may have been an original <UNK> but ends up being the focus instead of the characters
<START> wow its been quite a while since i've watched anything so mysterious in the way it is portrayed br br a detective story uses old fashioned black and white images to portray a private investigator who dresses in an old fashioned <UNK> coat and hat the theme of this animation is reminiscent of that of sam which was briefly mentioned by ash br br sick of <UNK> on cheating house wives because of his <UNK> ash was offered a chance to track down a computer <UNK> which he thought was a worthwhile chance for a four figure sum he could not turn down and the rest is history br br the ending was a little bit bland but still okay for those out there who like old fashion stories this is the one for you
<START> this was a great movie i would compare it to the movie the game you get to the end of the flick and cant move your brain has been removed and <UNK> not <UNK> and put back in your head dont plan anything after this movie you will need time to think about what just happened br br dont come to this movie expecting the matrix style multi millions spent on special effects this movies special effects come from the actors they keep you involved no they suck you in and dont let go for the entire duration of the movie great acting great plot very enjoyable film i cant say enough also very original plot plenty of twists and ideas that i would have never thought of the ending is abrupt and leaves you hanging wondering was that real is this really the end good ending not saying that it is bad just leaves you wondering and a little <UNK> br br great movie for those who like action like a good plot dont get up for a bathroom break on this movie you will come back lost and like mind games because thats exactly in a nutshell what this is
<START> robot holocaust is about the <UNK> most pathetic attempt at making a post apocalyptic movie that i've seen and i thought the italians were the masters of wretched mad max <UNK> some of those movies like escape 2000 are positively brilliant in comparison with this piece of poo the plot is nonsensical ¬ñ even with a narrator setting up every scene and boy does it drag scene after scene with nothing of any interest happening the special effects and i use the word special loosely consist of <UNK> puppets yes that's right ¬ñ <UNK> puppets the acting is abysmal is in the running for worst performance i've ever seen sure she's french or german or whatever ¬ñ but man is she bad i cannot think of a single positive thing to say about the movie so i'll stop there because ten sentences on this junk is about ten too many br br however and fortunately for me i saw the mst3k version of robot holocaust some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this mst3k episode a winner for a season one episode the <UNK> come fast and furious and hit their mark just about every time on my mst3k rating scale i give this episode a 4 5 ¬ñ seek it out
<START> let me start out by saying that i am a huge fan of <UNK> hoffman and have read steal this book and steal this <UNK> test also am a even bigger jerry <UNK> fan but his movie was a pile of rubbish that made a very pg version of <UNK> hoffman the director took no chances into making <UNK> hoffman interesting in this movie they <UNK> albert as a f ing cartoon devoid of <UNK> the man was a at <UNK> for ok they did a horrid casting job for anita hoffman did a horrible job casting for the jerry <UNK> character i just guess the movie <UNK> fit the news flashes that i have seen of <UNK> or the books that he wrote the movie just didnt fit and upset me oh yeah and <UNK> is the absolute worst voice over i have ever heard of richard <UNK> this is one of the few movies that i have ever rented that i could not sit all the way through because i have a passion for <UNK> hoffman and his band of and this movie was just plain badly done and it hurt me that now when people see a movie about the they will see a terrible adaptation and not get a true sense of reality instead they get a <UNK> of crap br br
<START> this is a pitiful movie what makes it even more pitiful is the time effort and money put into a super predictable script and action br br it's about some kind of monsters by the way and some kind of insects don't expect an explanation of the plot there is none that might work if there was something of interest or characters we could care about there isn't everything that happens to any person is as predictable as the other movies sci fi channel does br br don't try to understand what some of the characters are saying they speak <UNK> especially the annoying lead woman whose accent is a sort of thick british that is harder to understand than any old british movie you may have seen she's <UNK> br br a lot of money is spent on some great sets and scenery and that is the major crime of this movie because it just isn't worth it
<START> diane lane is beautiful and sexy and <UNK> is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and that's being generous the story line is <UNK> onto a <UNK> and remains thoroughly <UNK> br br set in let's say a <UNK> of <UNK> the plot would be deemed ridiculous all that saves the movie are the <UNK> countryside and occasional scenes set in <UNK> and and a film of the while the sun sinks slowly in the west variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the <UNK> locales in all the world
<START> hilarious sellers at his funniest a shame you can't get this on video or even see it on tv anymore i'd love to get a good copy somewhere maybe it's tied up in court on some legal issue but a truly <UNK> hospital farce with sellers as crooked <UNK>
<START> madonna gets into action again and she fails again who's that girl was released just one year after the huge flop of <UNK> surprise and two after the successful cult movie desperately seeking susan she chose to act in it to forget the flop of the previous movie not <UNK> that this latter could be a flop too the movie received a bad acceptance by american critic and audience while in europe it was a success madonna states that some people don't want that she's successful both as a pop star and a movie star the soundtrack album in which she sings four tracks sells well and the title track single was hit all over the world as like as the world tour the truth madonna failed as an actress 'cause the script was quite weak not so bad especially for those who like the 80's it's such a <UNK> trash colorful and <UNK> action movie at the end it's very funny to watch it
<START> <UNK> seen this at the fantasy <UNK> in <UNK> and left the cinema halfway through this movie with a bunch of other people so maybe <UNK> not the right one to comment on it but i think the fact of leaving s c is reason enough to do so s c is a different film people who need a coherent narration characters or a <UNK> <UNK> find anything in this one it¬¥s supposed to be an experimental film relying on the power of images but these images have no power they are so forced in their intention of simply <UNK> people out that they have nothing else to say the <UNK> of the off narrator is simply boring the visuals are cheap ok the effects are good but if <UNK> the only thing why care film wants to be shocking and thought provoking instead it is boring and annoying in its non creativity note not every movie without a story is art and there is absolutely no creativity in breaking <UNK> anymore especially not if everything is executed as bad as in s c <UNK> suggest director <UNK> should either visit a psychiatrist or a <UNK> before he mistakes crap for art again note i never want to see a baby getting <UNK> during birth again
<START> possibly the worst film within the genre in existence it was announced as a comedy but is simply <UNK> pathetic i don't think anyone could have achieved anything more terrible and irritating if they were specifically <UNK> to it is toilet humour at its very <UNK> i would avoid even watching the trailer i only went to see it because it was announced that if you like monty python you are bound to love this whoever wrote that was either biased or seriously deranged i am still <UNK> how one can honestly believe such a statement rarely do i leave the cinema really it takes a lot of effort for a film to have that effect on me this one did it in just 30 minutes
<START> why can't there be better tv movies made i was at a loose end today and watched this film on a satellite channel in the uk what a terrible waste of my time it was poor sets poor acting oh my god what a terrible <UNK> <UNK> that woman can even <UNK> a <UNK> of water too br br i really wish that people would make tv movies using better effects better or at least more believable plots far better acting killer <UNK> is well up there with poor acting a few bits of ham couldn't act any worse br br 1 final thing i really agree with the comment about the dog but i believe it would of already in real life
<START> this movie has got to be about one of the worst i have ever seen the humor was crude hardly funny and been heard a million times before the start was noting special and it got worse and worse as it went on i got about halfway through and couldn't stand to watch any more of it luckily i was only watching it on tv so it didn't cost anything but i seriously recommend you do not waste you time or your money br br nothing in the movie was new the characters were not at all developed i actually think it would have been better as a little kids movie in that it was full of stupid unrealistic funny events occurring thats like what happens in home alone or something not to imply home alone was in any way as terrible as this
<START> even though this was set up to be a showcase for some <UNK> and <UNK> vampires the turning could have <UNK> beyond that because it doesn't even <UNK> to be a good vampire movie fails to deliver any punch that it may have been attempting to br br using the idea of an <UNK> year old <UNK> vampire was interesting but the story about <UNK> she <UNK> brought into existence and now must wipe out actually reminds me of <UNK> and his plight in <UNK> and that isn't a good thing when it come to a vampire flick br br stephanie <UNK> is attractive and serves as the good vampire very well but her lack of any accent <UNK> when you realize that she's an <UNK> year old vampire added to that when she tells connor he's a young soul she doesn't deliver the line with much of the weight you would expect from an old soul attractive but not believable br br meredith monroe was more believable in her role but for a <UNK> creek <UNK> you would think she would have more screen time the question of whether amanda <UNK> and turns is the most compelling reason to continue watching this movie and you never get it you get a <UNK> of it but you never actually get any type of development out of the characters for that plot device it's a cheap way to play your audience folks br br if you want something that is a good vampire movie go find <UNK> dracula and if you want a sexy vampire movie you have dozens of flicks from hammer with a lot more strength than this one in the end if you want good or sexy this isn't the place this is just forgettable
<START> after reading so many glowing reports of <UNK> serve them all my <UNK> i went out and bought it for christmas a waste of money i'm afraid i was looking forward to something in the same league as and some of the few other great productions from british television but this is decidedly not among them br br the characters are all too good to be true <UNK> in a very predictable plot and with the most trite and eye rolling script i've heard in years yes it has its moments but they are very thin on the ground the lead actor is interesting mostly because of his uncanny resemblance to anthony andrews sebastian in only dark but his <UNK> talents are wasted on a character who is <UNK> self important and <UNK> his is attributed to the effects of his experiences in the <UNK> during <UNK> he does the early episodes centered around his nervous condition better than he does playing the the <UNK> clean <UNK> do <UNK> later on br br the women are completely unbelievable as in un real his first wife is annoyingly <UNK> and <UNK> the girlfriend the perfect sophisticated slut and the last lady a <UNK> <UNK> of political <UNK> the most interesting characters are <UNK> alan and one of the other masters named i forget the actor's name br br the high minded <UNK> of the script is typical andrew davies screen writer in his early years and becomes tiresome within the first two episodes this mini series is 11 episodes long by episode 4 i just wanted to get through the <UNK> thing br br the music is equally tedious limited mostly to one <UNK> piano tune and a sung by boys during the credits no expense was <UNK> on the location settings which gives some visual relief to an otherwise excruciating viewing experience br br i like stories of this sort as a rule and am very disappointed at the <UNK> nature of this series if you want to watch something riveting about <UNK> and its after effects there are many other far <UNK> vehicles to rent or buy one that comes to mind is 'the unknown <UNK> from 1998 the characters in that masterpiece theater presentation are real and fascinating and move one unlike the 2 dimensional puppets in <UNK> serve them all my days ' as for films on <UNK> schools stick to <UNK> mr <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> br br i know this goes against the general <UNK> view of this mini series but i strongly recommend thinking twice before <UNK> out 80 00 to <UNK> media for their 4 dvd set 2 <UNK> of which on my set had <UNK> problems with <UNK> and skipping
<START> man this thing bites i am sorry i ever sat down and watched it <UNK> was insane for making a film attempting to win over the viewers sympathy for this lunatic if it were up to me i'd have made the audience hate that low life instead of getting all misty eyed over him he killed people quite <UNK> i might add too and <UNK> wants you to feel sorry for him because he's not right i say <UNK> can forget it i hate the guy this movie is partly based on and hope they did wise up and give his sorry butt the juice in a nut shell don't waste your time it's sick and perverse
<START> this is one of <UNK> most underrated films in my opinion its an awesome heartwarming film with a neat story and an amazing performance from bruce willis all the characters are great and i thought willis and spencer <UNK> were just awesome together plus bruce willis is simply amazing in this this is definitely one of <UNK> best comedic performances the thing was great and i thought it was very well written and made as well plus the finale is especially cool it's good natured and it was cool how you can see <UNK> willis character change throughout the film plus the ending was pretty good i think this should be higher then 6 0 and it's one of the best disney films i have ever seen plus it has many surprising moments throughout all the characters are extremely likable and it also has a cute love story angle too it as well plus bruce and spencer <UNK> both had some really funny lines holy <UNK> this is one of <UNK> most underrated films in my opinion its an awesome heartwarming film with a neat story and an an amazing performance from bruce willis and i say its a must see the direction is great jon <UNK> does a great job here with really good camera work and just keeping the film at a very fast pace the acting is excellent bruce willis is amazing as always and is amazing here he gives one of his best comedic performances is hilarious had wonderful chemistry with both spencer <UNK> and emily <UNK> had some funny lines and was dead on throughout the movie he was one of the main reasons i liked this movie so much willis rules spencer <UNK> is fantastic as the younger version of russell he was very funny and didn't get on my nerves once he is one of the better child actors out there emily <UNK> is good as amy and was really cute i liked her she had decent chemistry with bruce too lily <UNK> is funny as janet i liked her quite a bit jean smart is good with what she had to do which was not much rest of the cast do fine overall a must see out <UNK> 5
<START> this was the biggest disappointment of a movie sucks <UNK> i was really looking forward to it br br all the twists were crap they were all flashbacks br br what makes a good heist movie is the believability of the the job yes it has to be surprising so the audience is stunned but if you walk away and go that's <UNK> t what's the point br br plus the main heist was a bag snatch anyway you didn't get to see the team operating at it's full <UNK> and brilliant potential there was not even one good heist in this movie they were all rubbish including that french break dancing crap to get through the <UNK> it's easy to do that when they are <UNK> in afterwards plus that kind of stuff has already been done in at least one other movie and it was stupid then as well br br also there's no reason to have even half of the 12 or 11 in this movie what difference do half of the cast really make to the outcome of this movie half the scenes don't even need to be there br br the first one was classy this was cheap and it makes the whole team loose credibility especially ocean himself for <UNK> down the bennett
<START> i'm rating 'the decline of the american <UNK> just about below average since it wasn't terrible but also not great i liked the very open conversations from people so incredibly selfish and ugly inside and out that was probably the most original aspect ¬ñ a dialogue laced sexual small film with people who are extremely far from models that aside it seems ironic that these french speaking <UNK> have a movie about a <UNK> society that well is in when their own actions are their own demise a group of women friends and male friends spend half the movie laughing it up on their <UNK> and acceptance of such behavior and the other half intellectually speaking of how powerful they are for their speech and actions these are the normal targets in typical sitcoms the main characters make fun of at parties occupied mainly by college <UNK> sadly it's not their intelligence or <UNK> of history that <UNK> me it's their <UNK> made of ego and than <UNK> attitude that pushes me away and not one character could i relate to nor like when one cries i couldn't care less ¬ñ it's your bed when one complains i barely what made me <UNK> was one character uh <UNK> red another example of playing with fire sure i understand it happens to some people but it was hard to watch and i sincerely hoped the he washed his hands as he had no problem going right back to cooking for everyone on the complete opposite end of the <UNK> up <UNK> they introduce a stereotypical <UNK> this made me cringe as no one seemed real everyone was as shallow as their laughter on society unfortunately with no one left to root for you're left as empty as these character's souls
<START> the <UNK> brothers have done it again three depression era <UNK> george clooney john <UNK> and tim blake nelson escape a <UNK> chain gang and head off in search of buried treasure that will <UNK> their new lives along the way they sing on the radio and become much sought after stars as well as <UNK> great laughs and a soundtrack that is a lesson introduction to <UNK> music br br clooney is outstanding as the fast talking quick witted <UNK> everett <UNK> holly hunter plays his estranged wife <UNK> and nelson are flawless also in the cast are john goodman and charles <UNK> br br dan provides the singing voice for george clooney on i am a man of constant sorrow the <UNK> bottom boys song that serves as a <UNK> for the <UNK> laden soundtrack that also features alison <UNK> ralph stanley the whites john <UNK> the cox family and gillian welch toe <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> fun for the whole family you'll be surprised with how relaxed and funny this movie is
<START> i admit that i almost gave up on watching tv shows why because most of them are about doctors <UNK> or some girl boy who can predict a murder by sitting on the toilet seat but i must say i was wrong when i watched the first episode of oz one of the most brilliant shows on tv until today oz is a show about maximum secure prison and shows episodes in life of every cell mate inside the prison and their <UNK> what i like about this show is the fact it has the courage to show the real life in prison without any annoying characters stereotypes and unrealistic dialogs even thought the characters in the show are not supposed to be heroes you became quickly attached to them and their life sure their is a lot of violence in this show and some disturbing images of rape and taking drugs but that's the point of this show to present how brutal and frustrating can be life in prison heck you can't show life in prison like a clean environment with likeable characters right oz is perfect in every way the actors are doing an excellent job and the whole hour of this show is going threw really really fast the only thing that i didn't like in this show was the last season of the show i think it became too weird and brutal and the finale was not satisfying but overall oz is still my favorite show on tv so far it surpasses sopranos and million <UNK> and dr house crap with just a main title brilliant show which has the balls to show what other shows are taking away from us realism
<START> i found this a very enjoyable light hearted comedy set in <UNK> with some truly funny sequences <UNK> the rivalry between two funeral directors the <UNK> ideas used by christopher <UNK> character to <UNK> up his <UNK> are genuinely laugh out loud moments
<START> i'm sure that any legitimate <UNK> would happily ship out on the yes <UNK> why you could play full court basketball in the <UNK> room it's so large and how <UNK> the bay windows in the bow the better to see giant <UNK> or that appear out of nowhere did i mention the colorful mess cook with the parrot on his shoulder and the with what appears to be a <UNK> big <UNK> sub br br ok ok it's never gonna win any <UNK> for authenticity and if the sub is laughable the plot is even worse somehow the van allen <UNK> of radiation hundreds of miles in space have caught fire are going to make global warming look like a <UNK> <UNK> pompous <UNK> nelson walter <UNK> along with his sidekick <UNK> peter lorre looking suitably uncomfortable <UNK> a scheme to put out the fire by firing a missile into its midst br br there's plenty of intrigue <UNK> along the way with a born again survivor and his little dog too two <UNK> who can never leave well enough alone a of red shirts who are <UNK> and plot holes big enough for godzilla to walk through thrill to the being chased at what looks like 60 miles per hour by another sub no need for advanced <UNK> when you can follow from 100 feet br br the movie <UNK> from one cliff <UNK> to another the payoff is so <UNK> as to be pointless certainly not worth the 1 hour and 50 minute wait br br the technical <UNK> for this <UNK> must have been a 14 year old boy with a stack of popular <UNK> magazines worth watching if only to riff upon
<START> i really like harrison ford so i eagerly rented this movie only to be disappointed minute after minute mr ford seemed to be walking through very warm water looking for a place to <UNK> his co star was very good and had the better lines the story intrigued me but the mistake big mistake as everyone is identified via <UNK> license or <UNK> before they board any american commercial aircraft left numerous plot questions in my mind br br i could have cared less about these people in fact the sub plot of the internal affairs investigation was more interesting than the two lovers killed while flying first class to miami br br i am disappointed in the director sydney <UNK> who gave us the classic <UNK> and other films this one is a waste of time and energy
<START> i couldn't even i mean look okay br br wow br br not even a bunch of my drunk friends trying to make fun of the movie could enjoy themselves in the least bit br br i can only think how how do independent film makers everywhere go years without getting noticed or even their lives and con artists like the guy who made this get a dvd on a shelf it seriously looks as if some guy with a home movie camera went out with some guys he met at subway and made the worst thing he could think of br br hey guys give me some ideas start with a corn field and work backwards well you've gotta have actors straight out of high school and some broken corn stalks with <UNK> of clothing attached and boobs thanks guy i'm sure that you and windows movie maker will be side by side on your next <UNK> <UNK> project
<START> the war in the east as the germans referred to the ww2 soviet nazi conflict was a war of <UNK> on the part of the germany 90 of the german army were in the soviet union fighting their ultimate aim was to wipe out the so called sub human russian population and <UNK> the mainly empty country with german <UNK> after they had won br br read hitler's willing <UNK> br br here we have the german army presented as innocent victims and not as nazi mass murderers when are modern german film makers going to be honest and face up to the past br br better see the russian film come and see instead
<START> being stuck in bed with the <UNK> and feeling too rough to get up to find the remote i actually watched this abomination from start to finish how many people can say that and for any who can what's your excuse my god has there ever ever been such a total mess released by a major studio there is not one second of genuine tension in a supposed thriller the script is inept and ludicrous the sets look like they were <UNK> from a low budget tv movie and the cast what were they thinking sally field gives what is without doubt the worst and most embarrassing performance of any academy award winner in history her irritating <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> behaviour in what is meant to be a life threatening situation are truly <UNK> it's a wonder she didn't use all her future <UNK> to buy up and destroy every print of this turkey michael caine who now <UNK> endlessly on the art of screen acting even running master classes for would be <UNK> should be taken out and shot preferably by one of telly henchmen angela <UNK> an actress i usually like and whose name isn't even in the opening credits poor soul is ten years too old for her role and her horrible <UNK> yellow prom dress must haunt her nightmares to this day <UNK> it are karl malden and shirley knight hopefully they <UNK> a big pay <UNK> to <UNK> their involvement the whole film is a series of bad scenes but one that especially sticks in my mind is the explosion which results in the ceiling if an upside down <UNK> deck can be <UNK> as such <UNK> and a load of empty cardboard boxes falling through <UNK> how scary really really terrible
<START> now this is the sort of film we used to get weekly now a days it is rare to see a drama that depends on the cast talking to each other br br there are no explosions car chases or any chases there are implied sexual situations this is not film for the younger crowd it is for those that appreciate people talking to each other they do argue a lot as we have married couple having mid life problems br br emily watson tom <UNK> are seemingly a very happy middle aged loving man wife now living in this same small london <UNK> handsome rupert everett returns home to visit his wealthy father br br he of course meets emily watson it would be easy for anyone to be smitten by emily i say no more except that as the credits begin there is a fatal accident the rest of the film is about the <UNK> of this accident all the lies the various characters tell br br the acting by this trio the others is excellent br br <UNK> <UNK> wrote the screenplay based on a novel by <UNK> he also directed this was his first directorial attempt he did very well the entire production is first rate br br the film had a few month theatrical run in late 2005 is under 80 theatres this to me is a shame stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens but real good as this many others open in only a few br br by the way there are some very funny lines regarding certain situations br br ratings 1 2 out of 4 95 points out of 100 imdb 9 out of 10
<START> from the first to the last scene this film is made very realistically even too realistically that sometimes we can't see details in night scenes it's dark as real night in the desert sunshine is so strong as in real desert br br script and actor's play are also very realistic shots and episodes are edited not to show things and events effectively to explain them or as many hollywood films do to entertain viewers editing here is to represent the events as if they really happened in <UNK> camera is set sometimes far from dying <UNK> even the moment when the main character major is shot and killed br br such method reminds me of masterpieces of italian neo realism and the construction of the story here is based on the same principles as or the <UNK> thief <UNK> series of true to life episodes and a few pathetic moments which at first seem to be sudden and illogical but have inner reasons br br i think the inner reason of major <UNK> death is religious emotion <UNK> for innocent people's death not only his accidental killing of family in the village but also death of <UNK> under his command he is not depicted as a eager believer on the contrary he is depicted as <UNK> and responsible officer exactly for this reason his last decisions to go back to the destroyed village and to turn his back to an armed boy whose family he killed seem an act of <UNK> br br the russian <UNK> <UNK> which sounds at the end evening sacrifice is another context by which all the film can be seen from this point of view
<START> first of all mexican werewolf in texas is not a werewolf movie this title is <UNK> the story is actually about a that kills all the local villagers in the little town of <UNK> in texas i suppose the <UNK> <UNK> the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something and i guess it actually works because that's the reason why i bought this piece of crap it sounded so stupid anyway the movie isn't any good actually it's bloody awful but i didn't expect anything else when i bought it it's a low budget horror movie with a monster if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog actors and some gore then you should check into this movie but i must warn you this movie is really br br this movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen the actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous they almost never say a line in a normal way they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say it's so stupid it almost looks like a <UNK> parody it's like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo she's the worst of them all i have never seen an actor as bad as her and i've seen even when her boyfriend dies she can't stop being a bimbo about it i hate her br br some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project but most of the movie is shot in the night when the strikes and the lighting is way too dark the gore scenes are few and short but really <UNK> and violent the effects are pretty hilarious really but that's the way i like it the looks pretty messed up and it's easy to see that it's a guy in suit br br overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it's very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death i recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer
<START> a young man who never knew his birth parents receives an old farm in an isolated section of west virginia upon the death of his natural father he visits his property with a cross section of potential victims including the comic relief black guy and a trendy lesbian couple hmm will there be skinny <UNK> take a guess unfortunately the party comes to an end when the spirits of <UNK> killed by his evil great grandfather and used as scarecrows come back for revenge this film starts out well an <UNK> montage of depression era photographs and phony <UNK> set against a speech by <UNK> this i believe is his first appearance in a killer scarecrow movie <UNK> the mood i developed some hopes for the film which were partially realized the story was <UNK> enough the setting was <UNK> <UNK> the photography was mostly in focus the acting while no great shakes was slightly above par for horror movies in this budget range the film <UNK> actually worked within the narrow demands of the genre if the scarecrows were scary but they weren't they looked cheap they weren't frightening at all the better the monster the better the movie these scarecrows wouldn't scare dorothy let alone <UNK>
<START> this is an excellent james bond movie although it is not part of the original and more famous series and it is a <UNK> film it is very well done <UNK> sean connery to return to the role he made famous was a stroke of genius as was <UNK> the movie in a way that references his past <UNK> to not play bond again connery was as great as he was in his earlier <UNK> appearances the script is outstanding as are the photography and the performances it's the earliest movie i recall with kim basinger who became much more famous after this film barbara <UNK> was excellent and <UNK> maria <UNK> was absolutely perfect as the main villain the frequent references to the aging of bond and the changing times and attitudes of the british secret service were most humorous the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> those of the other bond films the only thing missing was the famous <UNK> music theme which of course could not be used by this competing production it was rather amazing to me to be able to see two excellent james bond movies released in the same year this one and <UNK> with roger moore an interesting aspect of the film is an emphasis on video games and computer graphics the early 80's were the first <UNK> of such things and the use of them in this film made it a very contemporary movie the film is actually a different version of <UNK> updated with newer technology regardless of the repeated theme there are sufficient differences to make it most entertaining i will watch this one frequently
<START> okay she's on the boat with this guy realizes he's out to kill her knocks him out and then finds the reason he's out to off her is this <UNK> that got her <UNK> killed so what would any rational person do maybe him over the head again to make sure he's really out tie him up look sandra honey you've got the chance to escape while the guy is out for only so long until you know how long it will take you take you to escape make sure he's not able to come after you i hate these stupid female victim roles the rest of the movie was just a series of twists and turns that were completely convoluted and too unbelievable to remain interesting
<START> this movie is really bad trying to create scientific explanations for zombies always ends up taking away credibility from the history of the movie there are so many things i could point about the movie that i could almost write a book on how much the movie sucks for instance there were like 50 people on the plane they killed like 100 and they kept coming apparently the virus gives complications because everybody had yellow eyes also the virus makes people <UNK> like lions or something and the virus not only <UNK> as it also gives <UNK> strength not to mention that this virus <UNK> up peoples hair it's also important to notice that if you shoot someone with a pistol probably only happens on planes that person is kicked back in the air remember that if you are <UNK> a prisoner on a plane and you loose him always look inside the <UNK> and <UNK> the size of a bottle you never know where those <UNK> are going to hide and if by any chance you can land a plane full of zombies against a mountain and survive happens all the time after watching dozens of people being killed just walk away from the plane watching the sunrise and making jokes about dating the flight attendant
<START> it's nice that these three young directors have produced films with good productions values and decent acting there's some good work here br br unfortunately they suffer from what much of modern gay cinema recycled plots too familiar devices i have seen the pool setting way too many times in gay male films and hackneyed scripts most <UNK> of all is dorothy whose preposterous premise is that a cute young guy will have trouble getting laid in nyc due to a <UNK> of <UNK> gay guys in his <UNK> br br in terms of cinema these shorts play like tacky little gay <UNK> <UNK> not a lot of imagination in their writing or execution basically they follow a point and shoot shot reaction shot master shot convention which becomes painfully dull after five or so minutes there's hope for <UNK> cinema in the works of todd <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the late great marlon <UNK> but not here these films are incredibly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and their values basically <UNK> to a gay <UNK> sensibility which is probably why they play so well at gay film festivals
<START> rented the video for a slow saturday night first viewing i thought it was funny took a while to get used to the american caricatures here we're more <UNK> to british <UNK> but very enjoyable br br watched it again next night and really <UNK> to it the characters seemed more human lovable even a film one could watch several times and get more out of it each time however my wife hated it no <UNK> for tastes in humour i suppose
<START> chuck norris stars as danny a cop who took down a <UNK> serial killer however when said killer escapes danny knows he is the only one able to stop the terror however danny <UNK> a secret he knows that it was sheer luck that got the terror arrested and even more luck that danny survived now a final battle is <UNK> but is danny ready right there in my description tells what the problem of this movie is norris is playing a <UNK> hero who still suffers from psychological trauma in the hands of a better actor this concept would be interesting and could make for a great thriller in the hands of a norris thriller it just makes it ridiculous and hopelessly also on board is american steve james and ron <UNK> but any attempt at character development is defeated by the atrocious script also there is hardly any action and i always preferred a norris movie with more fighting and less talking given the rating on this website i must not be alone br br out of 4 bad
<START> i tend to like historical period films and get new ideas for costumes for my historical group and a friend recommended this one to me i like johnny lee miller as an actor so i figured it was worth it and i was definitely rewarded his portrayal as a member of the english noble class was by far more accurate than i've seen in the past the comedy aspect of it left my sides hurting the costumes weren't awful and historically i didn't <UNK> too much i also noticed the fact that england didn't have a proper <UNK> system until much later but anyone who dose not go deep into the of <UNK> past won't notice nor care absolutely worth seeing i highly recommend this movie
<START> that was one of the worst movies i've ever seen why would someone make a movie about getting away with murder mr allen again plays the only type of character that he's able the sexually <UNK> man who can't get the girl get a clue allen there's a reason that's the only character that you can successfully portray stir clear of this movie it's a waste of time unless you want to know how to successfully murder someone i feel sorry for the actors who say <UNK> to woody allen look at his cast and tell me how many of those people are still working my respect for all of the actors who work for him immediately goes down because they chose to participate in the film
<START> probably one of the worst movies ever made i'm still trying to figure if it was meant to be fun but for sure i had no fun at all maybe the movie lost something during the english italian translation <UNK> for sure i miss the guts to watch it again in original version br br my rate for it 2 10 and i feel like i'm being pretty generous let's say 1 point is for <UNK> cause she's a nice babe and the other point is for those decent actors that got trapped into a worthless useless and pathetic movie br br take care br br alex
<START> the title doesn't make much sense to me i'm not sure what door in the movie shouldn't have been opened br br the movie starts <UNK> with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly <UNK> train car complete with the sound of the train traveling in fact the man's house is a train car and he has a <UNK> of train sounds the woman leaves and calls a young woman the young woman tells her boyfriend a doctor that she's been told her grandmother is ill and she needs to return to her home town she hasn't been there in thirteen years br br flash back to thirteen years ago a shadowy figure enters a house he <UNK> a sleeping young girl then goes into another room and stabs the girl's mother the girl wakes up and enters her mother's room and finds her dead with a knife in her she screams and an arm comes out of nowhere and a hand over her mouth she looks up in fear that early scene in the movie of the killer <UNK> her scream and the girl's look is one of the few effective shots in the movie br br it doesn't have much going for it in the visuals department occasionally there's some strange use of sound and there's some weird lighting in an attic scene where many of the <UNK> of glass are red and blue br br back to the present day the young woman arrives in her <UNK> house an old doctor is there who she doesn't trust along with the man from the opening scene judge and <UNK> the town's museum <UNK> she doesn't trust any of them and it's true they don't inspire any trust she's rather <UNK> throughout the whole movie she wants to check her grandmother into a hospital the men in the town want her house and the museum <UNK> wants the things in it his museum is already filled with many of the <UNK> things inexplicably the woman wants to keep the house br br the young woman starts getting phone calls from a man speaking in a sinister <UNK> he makes various <UNK> and wants her to do things to <UNK> him such scenes <UNK> often unfortunately there are so few characters in the movie that the possibilities of who it could be are limited worse still we see right from the beginning who is making the phone calls so while the young woman doesn't know even though the <UNK> occasionally drops into his normal voice the audience always knows no suspense each call <UNK> her more and more br br the ending was unexpected for me so maybe gets points for not going with the obvious but i'm not sure i cared for it
<START> first the a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama <UNK> ¬Ö is <UNK> independent and a menace to <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is put to good use in a tough cop performance immediately noticeable by its <UNK> and <UNK> force his <UNK> is not so much a man of intellect but a man of vast life experience and <UNK> instinct <UNK> ¬Ö is not <UNK> in the sense that today's and already <UNK> <UNK> enjoy using the word it is <UNK> most playful hour he tended to adapt books in a <UNK> note it's said that <UNK> was a big reader of detective novels as a director <UNK> firm hand is successful br br it is not a mystery or a thriller but a satirical look at a <UNK> couple and at the <UNK> proceedings those <UNK> with <UNK> masterpiece les <UNK> might find slightly <UNK> the <UNK> of things styles elements in <UNK> ¬Ö here <UNK> speaks about many things about a couple and a hidden love story <UNK> for <UNK> about the <UNK> world and about old <UNK> about police techniques and an old bitter cop with a boy to raise etc there is a note of only in <UNK> performance but also in the film's conception br br <UNK> is a realistic crime drama made as a satire it offers an outstanding performance by <UNK> as a tough police inspector <UNK> is an old cop with an adventurous past he fought in africa but did not climb the <UNK> because of his independent <UNK> he lives with his son a <UNK> at work <UNK> is tough and <UNK> an able inspector bitter intelligent and harsh it is a role of great gusto very <UNK> <UNK> composed his character of several defining clothes his expression his funny accent his brutality and that mocking air ¬Ö <UNK> is not made to look more clever than plausible when he <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> makes mistakes and his talent is presented like the talent we meet in real with errors and and <UNK> talent is one that comes also from experience from daily not the almost supernatural genius of almost all the famous detectives br br <UNK> ¬Ö is is a realistic crime drama and also a satire and a melodrama one can consider it among the first <UNK> <UNK> into the legendary <UNK> of the french police long ago eastwood's and wayne's harsh cops there was <UNK> br br the title is interesting suggesting that this is a movie about the police not about a case or a mystery br br as <UNK> <UNK> was perhaps the best and <UNK> in france in the way that welles was <UNK> ¬Ö is very true to <UNK> <UNK> comic sharp observations much psychology sharp irony the man was when he filmed knew what to shoot what to the <UNK> scenes of this film with jenny great stage success each scene is <UNK> shot <UNK> technical <UNK> were amazing his style is inventive satirical sharp extremely <UNK> ingenious br br <UNK> style was <UNK> powerful <UNK> some disliked it precisely for these features as he had been a great stage actor his movie style was deemed as too theatrical etc his <UNK> is a fine example of what was meant by <UNK> a role by a composition br br <UNK> had a very peculiar like a menacing bird of like van much <UNK> <UNK> and more intelligent and distinguished <UNK> had this <UNK> <UNK> air and it is useful here as he performs an old tough cop one of <UNK> sides is that it is a <UNK> <UNK> he is immediately recognizable <UNK> by the quality of his play i see that many watching this flick do not know it is a <UNK> is an astounding quality in itself br br <UNK> and <UNK> are the two french actors that i admire the most the first one was revealed to me by a <UNK> drama the famous one while <UNK> by a <UNK> comedy i was <UNK> to see that <UNK> gave leading roles to both of them br br to end a word about he wrote the novel used by <UNK> who had previously adapted another novel as a <UNK> comedy was an old school mystery writer in the wallace vein he became quickly outdated with the new <UNK> fashions when i was 11 i have read one of his thrillers and liked it much
<START> this film has not exactly remained fresh in the minds of film buffs and it's a crying shame its witty screenplay adaptation should have <UNK> oscar nominations for the great screenwriter i a l <UNK> adaptation and ingrid <UNK> flawless performance it must have been an honor for goldie hawn at such a young age to work with bergman looking more than a decade younger than her <UNK> years fifty four when she's on the screen it positively br br this is a film which may appear dated at first but it actually made me wish i was around during the <UNK> <UNK> fashions are as tacky as <UNK> are <UNK> that's one minor flaw isn't her character a little too for a gal who still lives with her sister but then again would we have ingrid any other way and who wouldn't want to hang out at a nightclub called the slipped disc br br the best <UNK> i can pay to this film is that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade that i never saw and that it left me wanting more speaking of wanting more i wonder what ever became of sexy supporting actor rick <UNK> he resembles <UNK> dunne in this film this was his film debut and i don't see any other major roles in his filmography as for goldie hawn she's done so much since then it's easy to not be impressed but i can't imagine any other actor in the role either br br since the movie is based on a play the line delivery may seem a bit stage y but it did not <UNK> my enjoyment at all in fact i am amazed at how funny it still is after over thirty five years because this film represents a <UNK> era it has <UNK> slipped from the consciousness of film buffs it is more linked to the era films that came before it than the ones that followed but don't let that stop you from <UNK> the <UNK> it has to offer grade a
<START> this documentary was very amateurish it could have been made by college students assuming that it was my <UNK> is as follows content c sound quality f cinematography f acting d soundtrack f casting c a overall grade d br br i found myself getting <UNK> as we walked down the streets with the characters <UNK> up and down with each move of the my mother in law even changed the <UNK> in her miracle ear and she could not hear the <UNK> dialog extensive post production editing and cgi would not help this bomb these students would barely pass my course my advise don't waste your time or money for the one a
<START> when the american movie industry tries to <UNK> look at their own government they make damn sure it looks good even when it's bad br br the film does 1 thing right it demonstrates perfectly what is wrong with the american politics the <UNK> seems to be to f k with whoever it takes to get things done mix an american <UNK> a cia agent a jew and an arab just to f k the thanks to us for giving us <UNK> bin laden br br the disappointment of the film comes in the face of <UNK> up the issues using imagery of <UNK> children with no arms and the stories of soviet atrocities and then making a blatant attempt to suggest a link between those and the reasoning behind the american help every sensible person knows why the 1 000 000 000 was raised not the dying <UNK> children that's for sure br br as usual the serious issues are covered into <UNK> of <UNK> dialogue here is to you you m r f s <UNK> at the end all that's missing is the american flag in the background and the stupid military the films can not help but leave the <UNK> of the feeling of american pride and glee on how we the americans have saved the world once again not even the last 5 minutes of the film can save it where an attempt is being made to stop <UNK> yourself and wake up to the fact that its just another american f k up br br the acting and editing was good though
<START> as cute and adorable as they are the story of three singing <UNK> just doesn't seem to have enough meat to it to sustain it for an hour and a half i thought that the first half hour or so of this movie was well worth watching it was fun it had a few laughs in it it was full of energy then it somehow just lost that i wouldn't even say it faded away because it seemed quite abrupt to me the fun was gone the laughter disappeared my daughter noticed it too she's 4 she laughed <UNK> several times in that first part of the movie then her laughter stopped perhaps it took on too serious a tone the evil movie producer working the <UNK> to death something happened anyway and it wasn't for the better br br of course the movie is trying to tell the story of how the <UNK> alvin simon and theodore began everyone knows the christmas song here we discover how they met dave and got their start the movie is updated to the present time although their real origin is noted by <UNK> street address of 1958 which was the year when the animated singing <UNK> were first created jason lee did a pretty good job as dave and the <UNK> voices were also pretty good david cross as the evil ian irritated me to be blunt and i couldn't figure out the point of the character of claire played by cameron richardson she added little to the movie it's a movie you can watch with the kids it's probably a movie you'd only want to watch with the kids in fact it gets a 4 10 from me
<START> i rented the dvd in a video store as an alternative to reading the report but it's pretty much just more terror br br while the film may present some info from the report in the drama you're taking the word of the producers there's no reference to the <UNK> report anywhere in the film not one br br the acting all around is pretty bad pretty much all of the stereotypes of <UNK> bitchy foul mouthed government agents each thinking they know more than everyone else there may be some truth to it but it really has a bad hollywood stereotype smell to it br br <UNK> user community ratings comments tend to be more right than wrong and i have started to glance at the ratings before renting whenever i can br br i wish i had on this one
<START> just to save you money and time i will go ahead and tell you that this movie is absolutely not worth the match and gas it would take to burn it don't waste your time as a matter of fact you would be better off forgetting you ever thought about watching it i have seriously seen better b movies in a language that i can't understand who ever gave <UNK> for this to be made needs to be the only positive thing i can say for this movie is that with a new script and the right director and actors it could be a great story let me break it down a virgin gets pregnant by a demon the baby while inside her <UNK> wants to feed on people they try to make up for the fact that this is possibly the worst movie ever made with <UNK> and pointless nudity all in all totally not worth the dollar it took me to rent it
<START> i suppose i like this film as well as any i know it is not perfect but under the title the <UNK> of lily this charming and memorable semi musical satire might i suggest have been appreciated more and still loved by those who recognized its special blake <UNK> produced spirit of <UNK> clever humor and solid narrative the <UNK> but delightful story line follows <UNK> smith a <UNK> type spy for the germans in a much simpler and less black and white war <UNK> <UNK> passing as smith is helping her uncle who is patriotic too for germany but neither cruel nor political merely <UNK> target is william a charismatic u s <UNK> leader who can supply her valuable information the plot <UNK> comes when <UNK> falls in love with has her eyes opened to the consequences of her playing spy and sees the effects of combat on wounded men at a hospital and realizes what it might mean to his men whom she has met and likes she gets jealous of a rival for affections then realizes she can no longer do what she has been doing and gives up the spy business the logical end of the film comes when after the terrible wwi has ended as she sings the theme song of the film wishing in a <UNK> theater one by one the members of <UNK> appear including her lover himself <UNK> they have forgiven her and their former opponents and even uncle kurt <UNK> joins in the singing of it's a long to to indicate all is well with the world again this is an <UNK> and sometime brilliant story idea written by director blake <UNK> and william peter <UNK> of john fame and it is a delightful narrative <UNK> including an who keeps crashing and other lovable types <UNK> this lively film and the feel of this stylish and glowing film is almost epic both in its scope and realization credit must go to jack bear and donald brooks for their costume creations <UNK> allen and jack stevens for sets <UNK> <UNK> for another beautiful production design henry <UNK> for his sensitive and appropriate musical score and to russell <UNK> for his shining cinematography in the beautiful footage the principal actors are julie andrews as <UNK> rock hudson as outstanding as uncle kurt michael <UNK> lance <UNK> as the pilot gorgeous gloria paul as rival and many other fine actors in smaller parts it is hard to say enough nice things about the pace or the <UNK> of the just this side of broad comedy this element is introduced by <UNK> to <UNK> the horrors of actual <UNK> to example the almost comic opera approach with which men made war back in a more innocent minded era of human civilization this comedy also helps prepare the way for <UNK> from <UNK> acceptance of a duty to the german state to acceptance of the reality of what she is doing and potentially what she may be causing this is a rare sense of life film about <UNK> her <UNK> of herself in the real world and then among others before tragedy can happen it is haunting i find and beautiful in many ways i consider it to be blake of directing and under the title the <UNK> of <UNK> i believe with hardly any changes it might have been recognized as the polished <UNK> of a film it is by every standard i know
<START> i watched all of the doctor who episodes that my local <UNK> station played while growing up got introduced to the doctor by way of john pertwee as well as camera copies of doctor who sent to america by uk fans to their us counterparts i had a great time w the show but it never seemed to take itself seriously i mean as seriously as a sci fi show about a time <UNK> could be i went to the cons did the costume bit doctor 5 6 and <UNK> were my costume characters loved it then it all came to a sudden halt program politics and lack of interest and funding turned doctor who into a old <UNK> that <UNK> into the <UNK> br br when i heard that the sci fi channel had picked up the new doctor my first thought was cool now my 11 year old son can see what i've been <UNK> on about all these years and know what the heck a <UNK> is i have several phone boxes and of various <UNK> around the house i didn't expect the excellent quality of story character development and f x i was to say the least pleased for the first time i found a doctor that wasn't a <UNK> a clown a <UNK> a trip head a <UNK> or a jerk christopher <UNK> is by far the most believable doctor to date now now calm down tom baker fans don't get me wrong i loved almost every doctor and his quirks but christopher gave something to the doctor that he'd never had before real word believability i'm just sad that he decided against another season i'll try out david <UNK> as i would any other doctor but now the bar has <UNK> br br bad wolf rules br br 2008 update i love david <UNK> his <UNK> persona is something that my generation remembers my son's generation can deal with and fashion <UNK> can relax he's a little more human than christopher but not as as other former doctors i miss rose i dig martha and what were they thinking with donna noble it's still the best ride on tv
<START> would it be too trite of me to create a review of just me saying the word stupid over and over again probably br br this is arguably the worst movie i've ever seen seriously there are better movies on mystery science theater 3000 i saw this movie for the first time at a friend's birthday party when it was still in theaters even though it was actually with friends and at one of their birthday parties i had to leave i actually had to leave i just <UNK> myself and walked out fortunately some of the parents were doing the same thing so i didn't look like a total jerk anyway this film is awful there is nothing to like about it it's painfully as in actually causing physical pain slow and <UNK> literally does <UNK> <UNK> unfunny you almost feel sorry for tom arnold but then you don't because you remember he was actually in the movie it really does pain me to even think about it br br it was on tv a few months ago and i decided i had to watch it all the way through just once i remembered then why i walked out in the first place and felt guilty for <UNK> its ratings by even one viewer the gags aren't funny the characters <UNK> interesting it's just a senseless mess of <UNK> and stupidity br br there is a small crowd of then eight year old kids who watched the movie when it came out and considered it brilliant if you think that having your face removed piece by with an ice cream scoop is brilliant then by all means go rent it but if you have any dignity whatsoever avoid this big stupid mess altogether score 0 10 maybe a negative 1 actually
<START> this film is an excellent teaching tool as a pre study of to kill a <UNK> in <UNK> with a study of the novel itself <UNK> bird can be used as an independent literary study or as an introduction to
<START> i watched this last night for the first time in 40 years it's bad really bad but it has enough hilariously awful moments that it's worth watching first of all was it deliberate to make the boy being <UNK> completely <UNK> he even says to <UNK> a la mae west you <UNK> me as <UNK> does a double take god only knows what would have have happened if the babysitter had been a hunk this kid would have <UNK> him in a <UNK> then there's the principal male dancer he is totally inept <UNK> with laughter as he leaps and <UNK> with no talent whatsoever over the grave during he never looked better in his life the two romantic leads are wastes <UNK> gets to sing one line and that was dubbed in by another singer <UNK> i guess he couldn't even carry a tune <UNK> does manage to be charming in his i fear nothing number and i guess very small children might like it but there's not much to recommend it but oh that seductive <UNK> boy that aspect alone blew me away plus the fact the family accepted anyone off the street with no references to <UNK> a child today little boy would be taken away from them
<START> in post civil war america the president van johnson travels to dallas and is <UNK> by corrupt officials and businessman interested in <UNK> the vice president whom they can blackmail due to <UNK> documents a <UNK> <UNK> convinced that his black friend is wrongly accused of the assassination aims to <UNK> the truth <UNK> <UNK> directed this fascinating if flawed film which obviously is an allegory for the kennedy assassination the film may wrongly present blacks as slaves working on <UNK> in texas but the film is nonetheless enjoyable and presents an interesting interpretation that <UNK> death was the result of a coup de <UNK> which many americans could not accept at the time <UNK> murder is <UNK> here as the black accused of the assassination is murdered by the men responsible on route to <UNK> worth prison this moment in the film is more melodramatic than <UNK> death with his various <UNK> shot down before his over the top death scene nonetheless this is definitely one of the more interesting and worthwhile spaghetti westerns worth a look
<START> this is possibly the worst film i have ever seen what a weak waste of michael obvious talent disgusting film from start to finish all i can say is this director is no you never once get inside the game the character's head the amazing talent with numbers the real had the coke scene is bad enough to throw your shoe at the set it might have been a great scene had it been shot for movies and not the stage with the camera half way across the house <UNK> over a mirror with drugs on it while the drama is going on far in the background the scene where he wins the big championship is just laugh out loud ridiculous this should be screened in film making 101 what not to do in making pictures
<START> i just got this movie for christmas and have already added it to my favorites list a cute and simple story which makes a beautiful movie who could not love uncle felix or not have their mouth water at the sound of all that food definite points go to sydney <UNK> for his performance of alexander <UNK> and also to <UNK> <UNK> who played john sloane the <UNK> boring <UNK> truly a gem to be watched every christmas
<START> i presume you are here for damage to your mental <UNK> val br br mike nelson made me watch this he mentioned it in his book movie i asked myself why would mike nelson steer me wrong i now know why the <UNK> never trusted mike nelson br br the music is by john williams which is probably part of his <UNK> to the devil in fact i'm sure anyone who worked on this movie is probably in league with ol' or is now cursed from the executive director down to the guy who ran the <UNK> truck outside the studio don't watch for the love of god don't watch not even making a copy and showing someone else will un curse you i'm doomed now i understand this i accept this but save yourself
<START> i am a huge gone with the wind fan and i read scarlett before it was a miniseries and loved it this is a sequel of sorts like you didn't expect it with that frankly dear i don't give a damn ending timothy dalton was great as <UNK> though no one will ever replace clark gable <UNK> kilmer on the other hand could give <UNK> leigh a run for her money though i feel almost guilty even saying that her attitude and presence in the film fits the character to a <UNK> making you love and hate her at the same time which is how most feel about ms <UNK> portrayal as well the film does move slowly mostly because it follows the book so closely and was not released as a feature film excellent choice on the <UNK> part i think this movie deserves some recognition for the great storyline the revival of characters that had been gone for almost 50 years and for being something that even margaret mitchell herself could have been proud of
<START> it seems like people are attracted to shows that showcase pathetic lives that have no purpose what so ever to me i give my sincerity to nbc for their dire efforts to make new changes in television making laugh track free shows they seem to always find big success like the office when i first started to watch it seemed to me that it could have potential to be a smash hit but after a couple of episodes i really felt like going to church and <UNK> every penny in my entire bank to pathetic people <UNK> in these <UNK> poor <UNK> areas and the end where they show earl and the brother in bed together it just seems to me that this show is trying to show the bad side of life like street <UNK> or people who struggle to pay the rent and have no sense of what the real world of normal people in society are like i just seem to always be disgusted when i watch the filth the people in this show live in it's like <UNK> beach in california beautiful but so many <UNK> believe me i'm no rich guy middle class and not a clean freak either a bit sloppy but it just seems to me that the show just can't seem to get off of all the gruesome <UNK> people out there who have one leg i just wish that they would show a little more class not all filth and <UNK> and trailers and just below average life it just seems to <UNK> me to me this show is nothing more than a showcase of what not to do in life what not to be it also shows me that education is the most important thing you can have because apparently these two don't have an ounce of <UNK> this is a <UNK> u
<START> <UNK> women who remove their clothes at the drop of a hat or a <UNK> are about the only stand out points in a film that is otherwise slow and <UNK> although the basic premise of the story offers a wealth of possibilities they are never developed to any satisfying degree and exposition is almost non existent a large <UNK> of the film is mere <UNK> through the corridors of a multi <UNK> clinic hospital the overall effect is bleak and <UNK> a la <UNK> <UNK>
<START> the first half of the movie is not that bad actually although there's not really too much depth in the characters the story is somehow funny and generally ok with potential to get better which it doesn't br br in the second half things start to turn for the worse not only for the characters in the movie but also for the viewer who will be basically waiting for the story to come to its obvious end br br the previous user comment mentioned it's a love story a road movie a thriller a comedy of errors an 80's movie and most of all it's a jonathan <UNK> movie br br well please allow me to <UNK> that it's a boy gets girl story they happen to be driving around in cars the thrill is gone as it is all too clear how things will <UNK> there wasn't any scene in this film to which one might laugh out loud it does have some slight 80's feeling and yes jonathan <UNK> really was the director
<START> this covers just about every area of the creative process and goes through the three stages <UNK> with the main focus <UNK> placed on the production there are documentaries that go into more detail and cover the other two groups better this consists of artwork behind the scenes footage clips of the movie and many interviews with a running time that comes in at just over two hours the audience is entitled to a lot of information given that this is nearly the same length that the film itself is it could be <UNK> that a lot of the time is spent on the people with the craft and the result of their <UNK> efforts coming in second this is well done with tight editing it gets into the technology some and reveals how certain effects were achieved this spends a lot of time on the physical training in <UNK> for the fighting and such you do get nice <UNK> shots of the people crew and actors alike the ultimate matrix 10 disc set of this also holds nearly three hours of music in a simple system with individual track selection and a play all function about <UNK> minutes worth of material in addition to the title itself in various <UNK> the original release however has several very brief extras including clips of the making of the sequels a preview of the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tapes a complete run through of a couple of the biggest martial arts sequences with stunt performers and almost the exact cinematography with the same shots and angles of those bits in the finished silver screen effort the language is quite strong but rather <UNK> nearly non existent i recommend either version of this to anyone who enjoys the concept and or wants to know about how they put the first one together 7 10
<START> i like both this version of <UNK> gray and the mgm version both add a little girl early in the story who grows up to have an association with <UNK> this is not in the original book and that is my only complaint i especially like angela lansbury as <UNK> <UNK> and george sanders as harry in the mgm version but <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> in the tv version is much better looking i think and far more ruthless than <UNK> <UNK> in the mgm version i think <UNK> is more true to the <UNK> <UNK> in the end this is a very good adaptation of the novel it even hints at with men as does which could not be done in the mgm version
<START> dull one note characters with next to no development unimpressive performances by people who sound like they're simply reading lines and ludicrous special effects combine to make this a genuine stinker the story begins with <UNK> bland <UNK> russo and his fellow soldiers attacking an al <UNK> training base the scene tells us that al <UNK> has recently come to seek an ultimate weapon and also serves to illustrate <UNK> only character <UNK> a tendency to <UNK> <UNK> with the help of a collection of blank <UNK> and walking stereotypes including a russian spy russo travels to territory to catch a mad scientist working for the terrorists along the way they encounter vast <UNK> of flesh eating bats that fly in broad daylight for some reason from there the movie becomes nothing more than a dragging <UNK> of ridiculous action including a scene in which a <UNK> of bats <UNK> a <UNK> arm off
<START> i was not expecting a classic but at least a funny film there were only a few scenes that makes you laugh but nothing more you don't scare it is full of american teen slasher cliches and you can guess what will happen easily br br but it tells much about a senior student in a turkish high school pressure of student selection <UNK> <UNK> that 3 hour <UNK> <UNK> which university you'll go and thinking about the <UNK> when a ghost is after you is not exaggeration the movie is bad don't waste your time to watch it
<START> this is one of those movies when you are watching it you wonder whether it is documentary or fiction after the movie <UNK> answered many questions and we learned that the movie has a script br br camera is silent he is not <UNK> he almost <UNK> director from the movie by purpose background is not organized to make the picture pretty however don't get me wrong there is a lot of <UNK> for this movie starting on personal level being the part of environment being to be ignored when you film br br main character is a <UNK> actor in every sense br br i would like to thank all crew for this movie showing us another country within nyc i strongly suggest it if you like stories of others br br
<START> it was a rare treat to see checking out i was touched by the characters laughed a lot at the wonderful script and was deeply moved by the genuine emotions <UNK> portrayed by this ensemble cast and especially by peter falk in fact one of his scenes in the kitchen of his apartment with his children where he tells of his experience of his life his deep love for his wife and his decisions about his life going forward is so profoundly real that it is at the highest level of the best academy award winning performances he is a <UNK> actor who out did himself in this film the screenwriter offers a combination of literary knowledge timing a gift for dialogue and hilarious situations that had me laughing out loud in the theater i highly recommend checking out to everyone wanting to enjoy quality storytelling superbly acted
<START> since i was just finishing the book mrs by virginia <UNK> i was excited to see that it was on one of the movie channels last weekend what i encountered however is a film that was boring incomprehensible and non <UNK> one cannot entirely blame the film it tried the best it could with the material it had but when the source material is virginia <UNK> and is almost entirely written in stream of conscience style with extended periods of and little actual dialogue one would certainly think that there shouldn't be a film made from it just because a film can be made from it br br vanessa redgrave who plays the title character does not deserve any blame for the failure of this film nor do any of the other actors it is just simply a film that could not be made from the story that wrote and should not have even been attempted don't watch the movie read the book br br <UNK>
<START> am i the only one who thought the point of this film was the graphic violence i knew nothing about leigh scott when i rented it and would not have done so if i had known that most of his previous films were horror films i am not into that at all i was just expecting an informative <UNK> of the 9 11 report br br instead i got an almost incomprehensible violent movie the only good thing about it for me was that it made me want to read the report to figure out what the heck this movie was about br br i wrote this because i am shocked that we have become so <UNK> to violence in films and on tv that it was not even worth commenting on by the <UNK> whose reviews that i read
<START> all through his career hitchcock did great films this was not one of them br br a man knows too much his daughter is kidnapped to secure his silence and in the denouement all is resolved to the <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> drama br br anyone who has seen 1930s fritz lang films <UNK> comes to mind will know how far this urban narrative of crime and conscience falls short of what had already been done in that genre at that time there is an altogether amateurish air about much of the staging and acting which <UNK> any sense of menace darkness and <UNK> that hitchcock might have been seeking to br br what it is worth watching out for however is the sequence associated with the shooting at the albert hall once that kicks off it is as if the film has been given a blood <UNK> the <UNK> is lively the cuts are interesting and the way that everything combines to a climax is <UNK> here you can see the future master hitchcock effortlessly <UNK> all the resources to impressive and memorable effect when the scream comes you really feel as well as hear it
<START> i have to agree with the previous author's comments about the excellent performances and plot started watching this movie by accident lazy sunday afternoon <UNK> channels to see if anything good was on and was <UNK> by martin sheen and <UNK> <UNK> wow gut wrenching kudos to everyone have always admired martin sheen but was particularly impressed with <UNK> excellent job of acting and directing simply superb so why have i never heard of this movie before i'll have to spread the news
<START> mst3k fodder it's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason there are some hilarious things in it such as the mysterious device the bad guy is seen working on for the whole movie that turns out to be this tiny helicopter that <UNK> around carrying and firing a machine gun without so much as a <UNK> but is brought down by a bag of <UNK> the kind they release at political conventions many other wonderful touches of that sort stars charlie sheen there's one scene where he spends five minutes recording a conversation only to drop the in the river by accident if they'd cast <UNK> <UNK> in the part that never would've happened
<START> i can't count the times i have watched this and although it <UNK> from the book in story line the mood is still the same the bond that two such diverse people give each other that surpasses trials and years is immortal and that the element of the women prisoners was an actual event that did happen to real people the story is about the strength of character of ordinary people people who just tried to survive a horrible time in their lives and this also presented australia in a real mode the country is like all countries areas that everyone loves quaint country areas and desolate areas but it gives a stage for transformation from a <UNK> <UNK> town to a family community
<START> for the first forty minutes or so <UNK> is a real pleasure to watch the characters and their situation are interesting and the photography and locations are beautiful to look at then jill <UNK> discovers her son matthew barry is using heroin and the movie starts to unravel and then becomes outright laughable in its sickness br br <UNK> asks him why and when he started using the drug and she nor the audience ever get a straight answer which would be a bit helpful he mentions not caring about anything but that's not right because we see clearly in the amazing early scenes that he has a good deal of interest in his mother's singing baseball sex and apparently cared enough to turn down marijuana this movie is for people who think junior gets into hard drugs because mom and dad were <UNK> who missed his piano <UNK> i think such a dangerous and emotionally <UNK> drug like heroin was chosen as some sort of intellectual <UNK> for the later scenes of incest there's a lot of discussion about the mother's love for the son but it's really about <UNK> being pretentious <UNK> would have been great as a quaint little family drama br br how old was matthew barry in this movie i was more concerned over the bizarre things he had to do as an actor for this film than for anything his character was going through out of
<START> yes the movie is not a piece of art but the first time i watched it i was 10 years old my parents were out and i stayed home with my two brothers it was may 1970 i know that because i found a note about the cycle of horror movies that one network had it's one of the most vivid memories i have with the guys we ended all in one bed and covered up to the head our very first horror movie we kept talking about it for years and laughing about the moment those were horror movies nowadays horror movies are always the same or was it better when we were kids enjoying without <UNK> the plot and the cast and the dialogs most sure it was that but for me this is a great movie
<START> over the weekend i watched the movie <UNK> the <UNK> and if i was to have to score this movie out of 100 i would have to give it 100 no question asked i am a true believer in true love and this movie moved me in alot of different ways and the actors fit the parts without a but i have to say that the ending was not so great for i did not see that spark in <UNK> eyes when ever she looked into eyes as her eyes <UNK> each time she looked at kitty kitty only had to be in the room or in <UNK> thought and nancy would just glow that spark kitty told nancy that she could not find her and that she looked for her but could not find her kitty was ready to give it all up to get nancy back in <UNK> eyes you could see <UNK> pain i believe that nancy should have let kitty see that <UNK> love is true and strong and that she would not let her go that easy you need to make a part two and have the two make it together but you must not let anyone else play the roles it has to be the real kitty nancy or it'll never work my mother once told me that true love is just not real i am no fool i know that we all have a true love out <UNK> just waiting for each of us and i believe with my life that <UNK> true love really is only kitty and <UNK> true love is only nancy come on lets play the game the right way the only way let <UNK> eyes shine again kitty lost her everything by losing nancy and kitty is not to be the only one to blame i am gay myself and being gay is not easy wake up in <UNK> i'd not want to be gay kitty was lost deep inside herself and in <UNK> maybe the right thing to do was to be married to a man even though you love a woman kitty needed nancy to stand up to her needed nancy to fight for her myself i remember how deeply i loved this girl and i let her get away because i thought i was doing something wrong and i went back to my ex boyfriend i thought i was doing the right thing but i know i was wrong to let go of her and i will pay for the rest of my days for like kitty i could not find her <UNK> i heard that she is married to a man in the u s a <UNK> i even heard that he beats her i guess in the end we both lose give the two girls one more chance life can be very lonely if you are not true to you and your loved one br br thank you <UNK> ann
<START> you can survive anything anything except a dumb horror flick the director couldn't even decide whether he wanted a demon or just a plain ol' backwoods serial killer you can't have both it's like michael moore trying to have his cake and eat it too or in his case <UNK> <UNK> by making his particular <UNK> brand of <UNK> comedies they're supposed to be oh so hilarious and zany and yet you're also meant to treat them as truth based earth shattering hard hitting documentaries some genres cannot be mixed br br anything can happen to anyone any time any place translation this is the horror genre so we can do any kind of nonsense we want this sounds not so much like something wise found on a paper of a chinese fortune cookie but more like the <UNK> of every bad horror film director we get this <UNK> of a statement served to us early on sort of as a <UNK> justification of the absurd <UNK> to come br br my phone isn't working well of course it isn't there is a far greater chance that sean <UNK> brain starts working after decades of <UNK> <UNK> than that a horror film cell phone does the single most dreary and predictable horror clich√© of the past decade why even say it we know help will never come via a phone call so <UNK> horror making might as well just not even mention it the last 50 horror films i saw use this plot device it's becoming embarrassing br br you always have to expect the unexpected the final twist was rather surprising i'll give them that much however plenty of nonsense on the way there br br check out the elaborate traps the heroine sets up with the speed of a drugged up lab rat in the cold wet and almost totally dark conditions i just love horror film realism br br when a blood <UNK> demon starts trying to be funny by his victims then you know your horror viewing pleasure is in doubt the less said about the old <UNK> cracking wise the better another stupid clich√© served by a tired lazy uninspired director br br what are the odds of being attacked by your husband and then by an eye hating demon on the same day expect the unexpected they might as well have <UNK> in an event in which she survives a plane crash and then another in which she encounters aliens who tried to <UNK> <UNK> her br br the fast forward button needs a temple or a <UNK> built in its image
<START> this coming from an adult who happened to come across the first one expecting a movie aimed towards children and was surprised at the adult humor that was in new groove the character i liked most of all was so i was thrilled when i heard of the sequel <UNK> featuring non other than br br i just watched new groove it took me two days because i had to shut it off i was so bored halfway through it i finally watched the rest of it the next day and unfortunately the 2nd half was every bit as lame as the first br br being a disney film i was expecting to have some musical scenes however this one was filled with them and they were not amusing the great thing i found about new groove was that it could be appreciated by a wide audience from <UNK> to adults new groove in all honesty did nothing for me nor my girlfriend and we both loved the first it is really aimed towards young children the comedy is pretty childish the musical scenes are not very well done and the plot itself is extremely corny br br save yourself some money and rent this movie if possible because its definitely not worthy of a second viewing i was extremely disappointed and shocked at how thrown together this film was they actually managed to make a character not funny in this film that is amazing in itself br br obviously every ones opinion <UNK> but i am very easily amused i usually enjoy sequels <UNK> even when others <UNK> them mostly because i loved the first so much i needed more of the characters and no matter how bad the plot was i would enjoy the film i cannot say the same for this one i never would have thought i would be turning it off half way through due to pure boredom br br buy at own risk
<START> <UNK> and shoddy and at times too darkly lit dark <UNK> scenario is not even close to being original dark and <UNK> basement kidnapped prisoners <UNK> survival carey <UNK> tells her family and friends she will be <UNK> across europe she doesn't make it out of town she is grabbed from a rainy sidewalk drugged and <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> she eventually realizes she is not alone and upon meeting a few of her fellow <UNK> there is different thoughts on survival her cell mates start dying off one by one can she garner enough strength and courage to see daylight again others in the cast <UNK> rachel <UNK> eva arthur <UNK> and <UNK> parker
<START> ever since they first came to the outer banks and filmed the movie i have lived here my whole life i have waited for this movie to come out and i mean waited and waited and waited over a year and a half for this movie and to me it was worth it br br the movie is different from the book but in my eyes it's still a beautiful piece of work as is the book in both i cried there were moments that <UNK> me up i laughed and i <UNK> just as much it's a great movie with a great story line br br it's about never giving up on finding that one the one that will change you forever the one that will shape your soul and <UNK> you to a whole new view of life br br i have to say that it is possible to meet someone and have them change your life forever which is what <UNK> character did to <UNK> i met the love of my life and at once was completely captivated that i never forgot him or how smitten i was with him until i him again a year later for me i could relate to this movie with my whole heart i think that if you listen and watch the movie with your heart and your hopes you'll see what i'm talking about it's never too late to find your true love great work ms lane and mr gere
<START> this one gets better with each new look certainly one of paul <UNK> best roles outstanding music score which was also outstanding on sound track <UNK> so why no cd one the very early <UNK> <UNK> sound film releases by the way the original <UNK> theatrical trailer for this is really great
<START> i saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it it is so sweet and heartwarming a real tear <UNK> i was still thinking about the story days after i'd seen the movie it's such a beautiful story about the difficult things all families go through it's something anybody can relate to i really recommend this movie to anybody looking for a saturday night rental with your girlfriends your family your boyfriend everyone will really enjoy it d it's a real story about a real family that would pull at <UNK> <UNK> not to mention beautiful landscape shots and fantastic acting see it i'm sure you'll love it as much as i did
<START> i'm mike i co wrote the score for this movie and proud of it br br and i love all of the comments some have not gone far enough br br the movie premiered in san francisco in the summer of 1973 the theater was packed with friends and family we all <UNK> br br five days latter it was pulled from all of the screens in the bay area br br if anyone is interested hearing some of scene by scene details which might make the movie even more enjoyable please let me know br br we could start with the shot where <UNK> blake throws the toilet to distract one of the evil henchmen <UNK> the radio <UNK> on the deck of <UNK> house br br or how <UNK> <UNK> the bomb in the original version br br didn't help it still bombed br br bring it on
<START> the china syndrome could not have been released at a better time twelve days after its release the infamous screw up in three mile island happened but even if that and or had never happened this movie remains an important look at what could happen through <UNK> of nuclear <UNK> jack lemmon turns in a five star performance as the <UNK> trying to expose a cover up at his nuclear plant with jane fonda playing the reporter trying to investigate and michael douglas plays her cameraman br br i don't know whether or not the current threat of a terrorist attack makes the china syndrome more disturbing but either way it's still definitely a movie that everyone should see br br i hope that those people who spent years pushing nuclear power saw this movie just so that they could know that their views and ideals are completely <UNK>
<START> i cannot believe i actually set up a on my <UNK> for this apparently they had a good preview or something i can't imagine it though after seeing about 5 minutes i thought to myself why am i watching this it is definitely not reality and some of the worst acting i have ever seen on television i am a total addict of reality tv and there is nothing real about this the acting if you can call it that is awful the only ones that are almost 5 decent are the girls that are meant to draw viewers to the show although they would need to be a lot <UNK> to save this train wreck if they would have more lines they would probably change my mind as they probably have no talent either this is obviously a very low budget production with <UNK> who are apparently very cheap there is no way they could get a job in anything else someone needs to direct these people to a job in food service maybe they could do that oh and by the way p i no longer <UNK> any space on my <UNK> or <UNK> season pass list definitely the worst show i've ever seen
<START> oh good grief br br i saw this movie title in the tv <UNK> and thought i must watch this movie ripping off snakes on a plane it will be terrible but hopefully laughable too sounds fantastically bad well i was half right br br this movie is eye <UNK> bad and sadly not even unintentionally hilarious it's just bad even worse it takes almost an hour to get to anything resembling action for the first half of the movie we have to endure some <UNK> foreign language mexican or spanish apologies for my ignorance and terrible acting as some woman <UNK> up live snakes for reasons we only find out later on then we have to endure even more terrible acting and we find out that those <UNK> in the foreign language could speak english anyway as the snakes finally get loose on the train and things move from the <UNK> to the ridiculous br br low budget does not always mean bad but in this case it does what we have here is a movie given no thought a terrible script a bad cast and not even the sense to <UNK> on it's very few strengths i give two marks for a few decent special effects and a <UNK> ending but that still feels a bit too generous avoid if you can br br see this if you like the wicker man remake terrible cgi
<START> best in show is certainly christopher <UNK> funniest and deepest movie yet the characters are excellently portrayed and the connection of pet to owner adds a new level of comedy to the movie i've been a fan of guest since spinal tap but in this movie he has truly achieved what he set out to do in the mock a genre he invented and has now <UNK>
<START> br br as i am a teenager i have about one hundred years of movies to catch up on i try to see a mixture of classics mainstream art house and other movies the 70's is one of the most important decades for films it's when the average common classical films changed into full of messages and anti social behavior it became like nothing anyone had ever seen before what a decade under the influence basically shows is how important all of the movies from around the graduate to about star wars br br richard <UNK> and the late ted <UNK> are the primary in this documentary which interviews such people as dennis hopper francis ford coppola martin scorsese robert altman and jon voight among others about how those few years changed cinema forever it's a very professional polished documentary and it's even <UNK> by <UNK> films however as this is a very professional one i would think that they would at least edit out the noise of someone behind the camera laughing to me that took out a lot of how neat and clean the whole thing was br br on the other hand it's a very interesting documentary about film by the people who make it of course they aren't bashing their own films or anything of the like but they're portraying honesty on what they thought of the films and what they meant i don't know much about film but i want to be involved around it when i become an adult so i feel like to someone like me this movie is a huge asset i have seen a good number of movies that they mentioned like <UNK> and one flew over the <UNK> nest but a little more insight into those movies were very informative br br the main reason however i didn't love influence is as <UNK> as it was edited it seemed to take its time in the beginning and be quite relaxed therefore not having enough time to get to everything that they wanted to show they <UNK> in star wars and jaws in the last few minutes when they were two of the most important it seemed like they tried too hard to show lots of clips and that's fine but some of them were <UNK> such as an extended one from network br br overall though influence is a very enthralling informative documentary that helped me at least learn more about a second golden <UNK> in american cinema br br my rating 7 10 br br rated r for language and images of sexuality violence and drug use
<START> my jaw fell so many times watching this flick i have <UNK> okay granted i really wasn't expecting the quality of say the others or even thirteen ghosts the new one which was just dreadful and is still head and shoulders above this insanity someone else noted the thin characters i wouldn't call them thin thin implies there might be something to them how about almost non existent in no particular order we have the girl who will scream the american who will figure it all out the macho guy who will just bull through everything until he gets killed the wise black man who will die early the extra guy who is there to die first the extra woman who is there to play tough that's it that's your character list and that is what they are and what they remain from beginning to end if they were thin they might at least change a little bit from beginning to end but they don't well okay the american guy decides he's going to stay with the at the end and the screaming girl goes back to wherever she came from that's the change other than that they all act according to their assigned roles and rarely <UNK> any real emotion when they finally meet up with the menace br br now the producers get props for an original menace i will say i had understood the story was going to be tremors but with ants instead of giant worms i give the writer credit these are very cool very scary ants and what they do with bones is excellent the first time the bone <UNK> appear i admit i jumped a few feet unfortunately the very cool concept becomes alien in the desert very quickly we get a lot of commentary on ants that may or may not be true but we don't get much of the mythology on which the menace is based and we get every monster movie clich√© ever made people go into places they know they shouldn't and when they have no compelling reason to moronic characters try to <UNK> our heroes and die for it one character does double duty as scientist who doesn't want to kill the monster but study it a very cool gadget is introduced only so the american can tell everyone something about ants that gee i hope everyone knows anyway then the gadget is broken our heroes run out of the one thing that can keep the menace at bay and then there is that final annoying moment when we know the menace is still with us and wonder exactly what and how the hey the hero or heroine came by it it completely <UNK> everything that went before as useless and false br br three stars for the cool use of ants and bones nothing at all for clich√©s clunky dialogue and dim <UNK> characters
<START> goldie hawn in 1969 was best known for playing in television comedy shows in particular <UNK> and <UNK> laugh in where she was the <UNK> cookie young blond she did make movies before <UNK> flower the most notable being a walt disney feature the one and only genuine original family band but <UNK> flower picked up on her character from laugh in and due to a good script by i a l diamond billy <UNK> second partner based on an <UNK> <UNK> play she was able to develop the television character so that a real performance was fleshed out as a result ms hawn won an oscar for best supporting actress in 1969 and her career took off to such future hits as private benjamin and the first wives club although other stars of laugh in did well on television henry gibson has a recurring role as a judge on boston legal only goldie was able to have a career as a movie star br br on laugh in <UNK> personality would show a <UNK> that would be embarrassing occasionally she realized it and would laugh loud to cover but sometimes she just did not see her error example goldie is introduced to the 1950s variety show host gary moore and is told goldie this is mr gary moore she shakes his hand and says much to his confusion i've always wanted to meet mr john gary moore but as toni simmons it is quite different she is desperately in love with dr julian winston walter matthau a successful dentist who can never marry her julian has told her that his wife with whom he has had two sons and a daughter will never give him a divorce so at the start of the film toni tries to commit suicide by the gas of her <UNK> but she is rescued by her neighbor <UNK> sullivan rick <UNK> a struggling <UNK> who breaks into her apartment and turns off the gas br br toni is <UNK> to live but she has sent a suicide note to julian <UNK> tries to deliver a message to ignore the note but <UNK> <UNK> nurse assistant stephanie dickinson ingrid bergman won't stop <UNK> work schedule to pass him the phone when <UNK> calls instead julian finds the letter and races to apartment only to find her alive when <UNK> supports her story that she tried to kill herself julian realizes the depth of her love and decides he must marry such a woman unfortunately toni has <UNK> <UNK> lies and believes in his wife and children you see julian has no wife and children since toni is a firm believer that she can't marry a man who would lie to her julian is stuck on a <UNK> tree branch br br julian comes to solve it by getting stephanie to pretend she is mrs winston stephanie is opposed to it at first but on her own on her first free saturday she confronts toni at the record shop toni is at they talk and toni notices all the fine strengths of character and personality of stephanie and since stephanie has her two <UNK> with her toni thinks they are <UNK> kids toni tells julian they have to see who is the man that stephanie is supposedly going to marry so the lie starts <UNK> for julian stephanie and toni soon a lover is given to stephanie in the form of <UNK> friend and patient harvey <UNK> jack <UNK> <UNK> is so sleazy stephanie <UNK> him that toni feels that he is <UNK> of stephanie br br and so it goes with one <UNK> most caused by the well <UNK> toni following another until the conclusion the script is full of first rate situations and one liners example julian to reward stephanie for lying about their marriage buys two record albums from store he has given a <UNK> stole to toni but she decides to send it to stephanie with <UNK> card stephanie is quite happy at getting the <UNK> but she does not say a word about the nature of the gift she got when she <UNK> thanks matthau he says the thought she'd like <UNK> meaning <UNK> but stephanie thinks <UNK> is the name of the <UNK> br br bergman must have enjoyed the filming as several scenes shows that <UNK> <UNK> that was a trademark for her in the later 1940s films but there was also the resemblance to her 1958 film comedy smash hit <UNK> there cary grant <UNK> to make sure the pair would concentrate on the romance of their affair without having to think about marriage when <UNK> lie is revealed to bergman she decides on a lie of her own to convince grant that she was making him a <UNK> here instead of being the passive lover believing matthau is telling the truth bergman <UNK> tries to get matthau out of his mess by little white lies only to find one leads to another to <UNK> everyone's lives bergman is seen as a nice woman who becomes part of the problem despite trying to be part of the solution br br all the leads perform well in particular bergman all business at first but gradually <UNK> her sexuality matthau is delightful as a man who finds a useful lie is an <UNK> that just can't be kicked aside the supporting cast especially <UNK> as the <UNK> and sexually slimy harvey and <UNK> as the u n <UNK> who actually has the <UNK> for bergman it was a clever comedy and a really good way for goldie <UNK> movie career to push forward
<START> no one would ever question that director <UNK> <UNK> is a genius but what we wonder about is is he an insane genius so many people hated this film i am normally the first person to <UNK> many french directors of making offensive boring disgusting and pretentious films such as the horrible recent film and the pointless and offensive <UNK> but strangely enough i actually think that <UNK> is an amazing film made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft and containing remarkable performances the film does carry melodrama to more extreme <UNK> than i believe i have ever seen on screen before but then <UNK> is extreme that we know the film also contains what i consider way over the top or <UNK> fantasies and wet dreams what with a mysterious group of young men training to fire machine guns at the <UNK> in between playing scott <UNK> rather fascinating music in a band which has its recording sessions in an abandoned warehouse filled with <UNK> and fires burning in old steel <UNK> <UNK> depardieu plays a rich young man in a <UNK> whose step mother is catherine <UNK> and he wanders into her bathroom while she is naked in the bath by the way but he suddenly completely when he discovers that his deceased father a famous <UNK> had <UNK> an <UNK> daughter who had been effectively <UNK> of by <UNK> as an <UNK> this is because the sister suddenly turns up as a kind of romanian <UNK> with wild <UNK> hair <UNK> face and little ability to speak french <UNK> depardieu then transforms himself into a <UNK> of the far left and wants to kill or destroy his family for their <UNK> and corruption and lives in <UNK> and extreme poverty while <UNK> a vast inheritance he then <UNK> an incestuous sexual relationship with his half sister which is shown in an explicit sex scene which has offended many people though i have no <UNK> to it as i think people are far too hysterical about sex especially in america where apparently it never happens the intensity of the acting and the filming make this unlikely scenario come off as an experience of powerful if depressing hyper melodrama the differences between <UNK> making an extreme film like this and the numerous extreme french films which i think are pretentious and disgusting are 1 that <UNK> is an excellent filmmaker and 2 he is seriously attempting to explore a meaningful if harrowing extreme emotional condition <UNK> a human being <UNK> and turns against his background many would say that the extreme elements in this film were gratuitous but i don't agree i believe <UNK> was genuine and was not making an exploitation picture at all it is very difficult to defend a man who goes that far and who for all i know may be a complete madman but i believe he deserves defending for this remarkable cinematic achievement
<START> this is said to be the first polish western and is written and directed by <UNK> known in the u s as dead man's bounty this film uses some strange visuals to tell a story that is short on dialog val kilmer plays a corpse and some scenes are through his dead eyes some awkward visual situations are actually comical in a sick way my favorite is a young man building a <UNK> chops off one of his own fingers and actually hangs himself testing the strength of the rope a cowboy known only as 'the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> finds a dead man kilmer that he thinks is a wanted man he takes him to the nearest town to collect the bounty he ends up losing the corpse and the potential bounty in a gambling game with the town's drunken sheriff linda and has the few <UNK> turned against him when he has a <UNK> with the <UNK> he manages to escape sure death and leads the small <UNK> on a dangerous <UNK> <UNK> one scene has the stranger <UNK> to a <UNK> wound by with <UNK> and a match the corpse <UNK> <UNK> to a <UNK> post as the sheriff finds out that there is no bounty to be had this movie also known as summer love has a haunting theme song sung by john <UNK> nevertheless this western is like watching a train wreck there is just something that tells you not to look but you do
<START> the original assault on <UNK> 13 is gritty witty and perhaps most importantly short this remake is mercilessly padded out and talky worse yet the african american hero of the first movie is here replaced with handsome white boy ethan hawke which makes this assault less <UNK> than the 1970s one god how i miss john carpenter and his improbable plot line and his weird sense of humor i even miss his b list actors who are <UNK> better than hawke and company br br i can't say i care for the new villains in this version they stretch what little credibility the story ever had to the limit the female characters are useless the criminals are all generic <UNK> and gabriel <UNK> gives another of his bored performances the <UNK> all wrong too it's bland action stuff that actually <UNK> from the tension simply awful
<START> think you've seen the worst movie in the world think again the person who designed the cover of this box should be accused of false advertising the cover makes it look like a good scary horror suspense thriller but no what we have instead is a movie that makes a noise every time a credit flashes across the screen the biggest name in the entire film is probably casper van <UNK> who hardly has a part br br i voted a one for this one only because i couldn't vote any lower if i could vote something like negative five thousand trust me i would have so for now i'm going to give 1 2 out of 5 just because it ended
<START> what a shame this could have been good the main problems are the script and the star the film cannot decide whether to be a slapstick comedy of a very uninspired and routine kind or whether to be a insightful satire on the old east germany and its <UNK> its attempts at the latter flop totally however the film does not hold together well and the ending is very artificial and unbelievable any stereotypes one might have about german comedy are sadly <UNK> br br the characters are stereotypes one and all and the leading character played by kim frank is <UNK> in the extreme he just cannot carry the film and appears to have been chosen largely for his baby face it may not be all the actor's fault he is a pop singer as the script does not give him much to work on br br one plus the recreation of the east german <UNK> and period is good br br the worst thing is that the film feels somehow <UNK> and <UNK> the film seems to have been <UNK> out by people who were not necessarily giving it their best and just wanted to make a quick buck from a few cheap laughs if they were giving it their best it is a sad case indeed i watched it at the cinema with an east german audience and i felt sorry for them the regime was awful in almost all respects but those who lived through it deserve better than this
<START> read a biography of the late george c scott and you'll discover why he was so enormously talent he was asked by an <UNK> what his secret was when making each character he played his own scott <UNK> he possessed inside him a burning fire which drove him in one of his last he sadly revealed he had lost the drive this was not the case when he starred in the movie the hospital in this offering he plays talented doctor medical director of one of the finest <UNK> in the country however life has dealt him some <UNK> problems such as losing his wife to a divorce becoming <UNK> from both his promising children and worse of all believing himself to be physically <UNK> at this point he is now becoming <UNK> <UNK> and frequently <UNK> various ways of committing suicide to add to his growing list of personal obstacles his main reason for being his hospital has come under siege by students and neighborhood <UNK> incompetent doctors like dr richard and a mysterious <UNK> who is killing both patients and doctors alike because he believes he is the wrath of the <UNK> <UNK> hughes few choices are left to one is promising doctor <UNK> robert <UNK> whom he <UNK> in by saying if there were an <UNK> around here i would put my head in it the second is a <UNK> young woman named barbara who is attracted to because he acts like a wounded bear <UNK> wrote the screen play and arthur <UNK> did an extremely good job of directing this dramatically interesting dark story but a vehicle nonetheless lit by the fire of george c scott
<START> the movie plot seems to have been constructed from a disjointed dream there is not enough realism to hold the viewer's interest the <UNK> farm scene was a failed opportunity to show the way <UNK> were set up and farm families lived which would have been interesting and entertaining there was little if no research into the <UNK> <UNK> trade of the period the costumes of the <UNK> looked like something from the french revolution totally unbelievable the <UNK> playing was good and of the time period but <UNK> motions while supposedly playing were unbelievable the <UNK> appearance was a never explained mystery and the train disappearing into thin air was too much i couldn't understand how a live <UNK> got frozen into the ice and why two men in the wilderness without food would release the <UNK> a good food source
<START> as horror films go rest stop could have been better in many levels director writer john shows he probably had the best intentions when he started it unfortunately either he was not sure as to what to do with the material or maybe he was under pressure to deliver a different movie from what he intended either by the studio or the <UNK> several endings have been included in the dvd but unfortunately the one chosen for the finished product is probably not the best br br the idea of a psycho <UNK> the back roads of a remote part of california presents many possibilities at first after the disappearance of jess in the spooky rest stop things get out of hand poor nicole is left alone to <UNK> for herself all the <UNK> she finds along the way br br it was clear when one started to hear amazing grace in the background that there were forces trying to avenge the ways in which nicole an jess their neck of the woods by engaging in <UNK> sex that is not well appreciated by the natives br br watch it at your own risk there's a lot of gore for the <UNK> of the genre
<START> hey i really do not know why this film has been appreciated so much perhaps i missed the point the way i see it a lot of international film makers have made brilliant films that have dealt with and have informed excited shocked <UNK> emotion and compelled the audience to step aside from their own reality and think while it is true that <UNK> <UNK> was an ambitious one in light of all the other movies this one falls short miserably it was too slow there were no details about anything and the ending was completely pointless it was not open ended or anything just pointless so watch it if you want to see a good concept completely wasted
<START> i grew up watching sitcoms such as seinfeld <UNK> simpsons etc etc in other words mainstream television over the years many sitcoms have come on the air and of those a very small <UNK> are smart and funny the war at home is a prime example of the majority of modern american comedy br br i give the show a 3 out of 10 because it is what it aims to be a comedy but it doesn't seem to go out of its way to be a good comedy a good comedy should have you swept off your feet with its big jokes you shouldn't be able to see them coming and in i see just about every joke coming the characters are probably the most simplistic and horrible stereotypes i have seen yet on screen and the acting isn't very good save for the father who portrays a stereotypical beer drinking sport loving american idiot perfectly br br poor acting unbelievable characters and jokes that don't catch you off guard detract from this show to a point of where it is unwatchable if you don't have cable and would like to see a comedy worth watching try boston legal it is more worth your time
<START> this is a charming little film which like many of it's kind <UNK> it's charm from the circumstances involved rather than the actual dialogue br br glenn ford as always shines through in a great comedic performance as the <UNK> air force officer married after just one day to gold digging <UNK> debbie reynolds br br after the one initial wedding night of passion and a life changing move to spain the two quickly realise that apart from the strong sexual attraction they feel for each other they have nothing at all in common br br however when she decides to give their marriage a go it is on the understanding that it for one month trial period only and sex is most definitely not on the cards br br ford is also falling foul to his new 40 000 lincoln concept car the future <UNK> which he wins in a the same night he meets his new wife br br the car is bringing him <UNK> attention from the air force who see it as a vulgar display of american wealth and is bringing <UNK> of corruption and <UNK> etc it is also putting him in the 80 90 tax <UNK> and as <UNK> as he is he now faces a tax bill of over 17 000 not the kind of money you should be <UNK> when your wife is the kind of person who spends over a 1 000 on one shopping trip br br even when he tries to sell it it brings him misfortune as selling so much as a cigarette or a pair of <UNK> to the natives is <UNK> by court martial so you can imagine that a 17 500 <UNK> practically has the firing squad <UNK> their <UNK> br br his potential is also causing him problems as he is a <UNK> handsome bull fighting spanish <UNK> who's interest in the car has lead to a stronger interest in ford's wife made worse by the fact that a rich jet set lifestyle is being offered and is what she has sought for so long br br with ford's sexual frustration rising and jealousy in his love rival <UNK> coupled with <UNK> <UNK> attitude and <UNK> behaviour around the <UNK> <UNK> serving to drive the <UNK> deeper between the two it seems that their <UNK> relationship is destined to end br br but can whatever love and attraction that threw these two love birds together in the first place shine through and keep them together br br not the best example of this genre of film but due to the watchable performances by it's principles and the enjoyable plot line it is certainly a fine one
<START> this movie with all its complexity and subtlety makes for one of the most thought provoking short films i have ever seen the topics it <UNK> are ugly cynical and at times even macabre but the film remains beautiful in its language <UNK> with its camera angles and gorgeous in its style <UNK> <UNK> the short story of the same name written by a master of short stories <UNK> <UNK> br br not wishing to spoil anything of the movie i won't go into any details other than to say that this movie is magnificent in and of itself it takes pride in what it does and does it well it shows the most important memories of life all of which can be topped by the single most <UNK> feeling unexpected bliss this movie of its own <UNK> has created in me the same feelings the main character tom <UNK> felt when words transformed his very existence and that is one impressive feat
<START> jean <UNK> joe <UNK> and <UNK> all are unlikely heroes and survivors <UNK> but strong jean whose strength and resolve help save lives <UNK> hundreds of miles and with calm self discipline and <UNK> powers joe <UNK> oh my word who took risks for jean and the other prisoners only to suffer the worst pain imaginable and <UNK> who trusted jean regardless of the odds her good humor and inspire everyone around her and those with the courage to go in with her are rewarded the beautiful scenery and musical score adds to the adventure despite the length it was never boring to me these ordinary people did extraordinary things and it is based on a true story someone borrowed my vhs a few years ago and i never saw it or them again learned my lesson mates and will buy another copy when it can be found it's a shame the miniseries is not on dvd
<START> throughout the world the <UNK> <UNK> of the american c i a can be found in many a muddled mess they have left behind in the beginning their <UNK> were simple spy remove enemy agents steal classified information and <UNK> <UNK> years have <UNK> and although their mission remains similar their <UNK> black <UNK> now include domestic <UNK> u s citizens and <UNK> american <UNK> who criticize the u s government this movie however centers on the c i a 's world <UNK> for the infamous <UNK> the ' the film is called the assignment and tells the story lt <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> quinn a u s naval officer who bears a striking resemblance to the mastermind of so many terrorist <UNK> <UNK> by jack shaw donald sutherland of the c i a and <UNK> ben kingsley a special agent from the israeli <UNK> is secretly trained to look pose <UNK> the <UNK> organization and to thereafter <UNK> the real working for the russians this film is <UNK> exciting and packed with wild chases killings and inter country mayhem quinn is wonderful and surprisingly artistic playing both sides of the war easily one of his best efforts
<START> though i have watched i do not know if <UNK> tastes <UNK> if it does this film is accurately titled so much of so little substance this is the celluloid equivalent of <UNK> only it does not <UNK> the <UNK> it leaves the taste of wasted time in the <UNK> mouth and if i could vomit this film and get back that <UNK> expense i would <UNK> was more exciting the director should be forced to wear a <UNK> cap and the spirit of ed wood jr couldn't save this semi professional projection from certain failure a waste of time a waste of mind don't be fooled by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> competent eye candy she was in the <UNK> remake less tragic and than sue <UNK> though by no means better however a previously competent turn of the screw does not make her a skilled <UNK> person you need craft for that not crap which is what this film is the <UNK> belong in the girls' bathroom <UNK> till the <UNK> burst while director direct less christina wayne should do 5 10 in study hall watch anything else and pass this class by bye forever
<START> jane eyre with full frontal nudity i was not surprised to see that a woman had had a hand in this awful woman's picture and i mean that in the worst possible way the trouble is it could have been so good if they had only left out the jane eyre stuff and stuck with the vastly more interesting scenes involving the spanish portuguese jews in early 19th century london when the sound track music is better than the film you know you are in trouble when you fast forward the video because you can't stand the film just to make sure you don't miss anything you are in even worse trouble this film will end up on the romance tv channel where it rightly belongs
<START> thought i just might get a few laughs from this long drawn out film but was sadly disappointed this film is all about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a passing grade with out even trying to open a book or accomplish anything the film also portrayed teachers and the principal mary tyler moore mrs stark labor pains 2000 as complete idiots i know this was suppose to be a comedy but it never made me laugh and i thought the entire film was a complete waste of time however all the actors gave excellent performances and had the hard task of trying to make this film an enjoyable and entertaining film just plain studying and getting good <UNK> for college is the only way to go
<START> obviously the the <UNK> here were written many years after the film was released and cannot be taken in context back in 1980 in post <UNK> england this film was bloody funny we were glad of something to laugh about and rising <UNK> with its sympathetic mockery of a complete social <UNK> was one of the best british sitcoms of its period if not ever it struck a <UNK> in almost everybody and in true british fashion we laughed at the in ourselves america had nothing to touch this type of humour because self <UNK> was not amusing to our overseas cousins leonard was one of <UNK> finest actors on stage on tv and in movies his commitment and <UNK> were second to none richard beckinsale was although young a perfect comedic foil to and should by all rights be <UNK> as an all time great had he not been taken so young i feel sure he would by now be classified as one of <UNK> greatest comedy actors frances de la tour found her finest television moment in rising <UNK> and for me never her <UNK> ability with further roles if you did not see the film at the time of its release you are not <UNK> to comment simply because you cannot understand why it was funny the humour of the moment
<START> i'm normally a fan of bruce willis and despite him playing the cold hearted professional killer i thought him the most appealing character here that said his character makes such a mess of his professional activity it's incredible he hasn't been caught before the plot is thin to the point of being nonsensical the end was no less annoying and insulting for the fact that it could have been predicted from about 20 minutes into the movie br br spoilers follow in hollywood morality the good guys always win with a few <UNK> along the way and the bad guys die or are at least heading for justice by the end the breathtaking insult of the film is the way that our ira terrorist who has somehow become a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> character gets to walk off to a new life as does his former terrorist <UNK> who is now a loving wife and mother br br who's the bigger villain the former and so far as we can tell <UNK> terrorist or the hired assassin i don't see much to choose between them in real life or in the film br br this is the <UNK> film i've seen this year
<START> it was surprising that a silent film could be so easy to watch the economy with which it has been edited and the films structure itself are the main elements that contribute to this br br the film really captures the spirit of the revolution that it is dealing with you really <UNK> with the sailors and citizens of course this film has it's own agenda but as it is a practically redundant cause it can be viewed as a piece of entertainment in a much <UNK> sense br br the tension created on the screen is excellent starting with the <UNK> itself and then moving onto the <UNK> things <UNK> <UNK> and for a film of it's era it really is quite <UNK> in revealing the sacrifices made by the characters in the film br br this really is worth sitting through that is if you can <UNK> your modern viewing <UNK> for <UNK>
<START> i can't comment on the accuracy of this production historical or literary but i can say that i enjoyed it if there is a god the sound track will be released <UNK> work is truly enduring twenty years on i am still moved by the haunting themes of this production and return to it frequently br br the story <UNK> the entry into society of catherine <UNK> somewhat awkward and possessed of an <UNK> interest in gothic stories early pulp fiction catherine <UNK> on bath in the company of mrs allen where she meets henry she is invited to visit the at <UNK> <UNK> the seat of the <UNK> and somewhat <UNK> challenged general who has the unfortunate <UNK> that there is wealth <UNK> br br where mutual attraction mixes with family <UNK> <UNK> is inevitable this coupled with <UNK> vivid imagination leads her to fear for her safety her eventual departure is marred by <UNK> and counter <UNK> of deception and <UNK> br br but the attraction between catherine and henry stands these trials he returns to provide a happy ending this final scene is especially compelling given the incidental music of <UNK> br br it may well be a bad production from the <UNK> viewpoint <UNK> costumes and shaky performances not <UNK> but for me it's <UNK> minutes of bliss
<START> was a hero and one of the <UNK> of the french revolution of this movie is set five years later and the revolution has <UNK> into something ugly while initially the revolution promised freedom at this point the small <UNK> running the country is extremely <UNK> and is a <UNK> and his friends were angry at how the country wasn't better off in <UNK> than it was before they got rid of their king so they begin <UNK> the government the movie begins as the <UNK> who makes critical <UNK> concerning the government is beaten and his business is destroyed so much for liberty <UNK> and <UNK> so as a result of being <UNK> this way et al begin <UNK> <UNK> the government eventually <UNK> the leader of the <UNK> and his <UNK> <UNK> up charges have a show trial and get rid of the <UNK> some have mentioned that the polish director also intended this to be a criticism of his own nation which at the time was soviet dominated and very <UNK> as well this makes sense as you see the movie unfold especially when the government destroys all <UNK> in the name of the people br br the acting is fine the story compelling and i have no major criticism of the film however i really wish the ending had been handled differently especially because other than history lovers and french people most probably have no idea that this execution helped to end the government after this <UNK> of in april <UNK> <UNK> himself was executed in july <UNK> because the country had just had enough plus those surviving <UNK> knew that they too would face the <UNK> sooner or later if this sick system remained in place some sort of an <UNK> would have been nice such as showing the soldiers coming for <UNK> he <UNK> by trying to kill himself first but he only succeeded in blowing off part of his face still alive he was shortly afterward this would have been a dandy little <UNK> and could have been done in about five minutes however not showing a connection between death and the fall of the government is an odd thing to <UNK>
<START> after a group of young friends experience car trouble whilst travelling off the beaten track they accept an offer of help from lonely local mr chuck <UNK> owner of a nearby museum full of historical wax <UNK> once at the creepy <UNK> attraction the friends are stalked by a mask wearing lunatic who can bring the <UNK> <UNK> to life through the power of the mind br br tourist bad guy is a demented cross between the texas chain saw <UNK> <UNK> and anthony the scary kid from the classic twilight zone episode <UNK> a good <UNK> whilst the plot is a blend of elements from the aforementioned tcm hitchcock's psycho and house of wax the atmosphere and execution of tourist trap however is so totally off <UNK> that in this respect it's virtually impossible to draw comparison with other earlier movies br br director david continually inventive and unpredictable treatment of his own script gives the film a distinctly nightmarish quality and with a brilliant left field performance from <UNK> an <UNK> creepy score from <UNK> <UNK> a collection of truly unsettling <UNK> with <UNK> jaws and the presence of super sexy <UNK> roberts who spends the film in and briefly out of tiny <UNK> hot pants and a figure <UNK> <UNK> tube tourist trap is a totally unforgettable and ultimately one of a kind horror experience well deserving of its cult following
<START> when i first watch this series the impression i got was that the characters were charming and funny and <UNK> in particular were witty and intelligent albeit a bit too <UNK> after watching it for some time however my opinion changed br br the main characters slowly revealed themselves to be self centered self obsessed who treated tiny wounds to their pride as the worst insults in their existence for example <UNK> wouldn't speak to her mother for months when didn't <UNK> her on her <UNK> marriage while dumped luke for simply wanting a little time to <UNK> to his new life circumstances these people are shallow see themselves as the center of the universe where everyone else should behave exactly according to how their own rigid rules and if they don't they will hold <UNK> against them for an eternity they don't want to see other people's problems and treat the smallest slight as the <UNK> <UNK> most of the characters appear to lack the ability to behave in a grown up way they think they should do whatever that they wanted and everyone else be damned br br the series is character based so when the main characters became so unlikeable the show also became impossible to watch i still have the rest of the series but i doubt if i will ever finish watching them i will also hold anyone who think highly of the show and its awful characters with the greatest suspicion they must just as horrid as et al
<START> i can't knock this film too terribly because it's obvious <UNK> through the the watching of it that they were trying to make it bad or <UNK> if you prefer anyway many of the parts they tried to make funny actually are but often simply for the cheese factor watch the <UNK> game actually played as real life scratch your head at the bumbling robots oh the and watch the whole thing go way over the top near the end with the <UNK> <UNK> and the sexual <UNK> just keep on flying i'm actually surprised this got away with a pg oh well a fun way to waste a couple hours but star wars trek this ain't folks 3 out of 10
<START> this film is amazing while not perfect by hollywood standards it <UNK> a gentle look at the wide <UNK> between rich and poor black and white that is true in many parts of the world it handles the audience with kid <UNK> while delivering a truthful look at societal problems the children are beautiful take special note of the young man who plays the friendships that develop are universally true anyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make the influence of adults is interesting it appears to be taken from real life experiences as there are <UNK> its of conversations and interactions much like a child would remember experiencing i would highly recommend this film
<START> imagine this a high school except it's <UNK> school and the kids don't have parents around oh and it's in <UNK> and the kids are all thin white and gorgeous with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the weird <UNK> and there aren't any reasonable rules like how they have co nuclear weapons in their <UNK> coffee stands a <UNK> bar and a <UNK> <UNK> per student br br here's the story a girl <UNK> brooks <UNK> a <UNK> all boys school absolutely perfect in every possible way she is smart pretty thin athletic creative and everything a <UNK> wants to be almost all the boys in school want her and every girl wants to be her friend she's the one everyone comes to for advice the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan and is just wonderful too bad none of this makes her likable br br are we supposed to believe that if we don't even come close to perfection we're bad people in the show <UNK> her fault and if anyone <UNK> her they're portrayed as the bad guy logan he may be a jerk but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply <UNK> with the princess every time br br her loyal group of blind followers are chase the average dumb ass that has a secret crush on her michael the token black guy and the only decent actor on the set lola a wannabe actress and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> quinn the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff and logan the rich jerk who has a soft side yeah this show basically <UNK> out stereotypes br br what <UNK> me off though is that they all try to pretend they're normal kids they complain that logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves even though they already go to a too good to be true <UNK> school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can't afford they drink coffee and eat <UNK> on a regular basis hardly have <UNK> and <UNK> almost every day wow they have it hard any other problems i'm too good looking rich and stress free i guess <UNK> 101 what's the 101 for anyway is <UNK> attempt at trying to portray teens realistically except they caught a glimpse of reality didn't like it and decided to give the kids lives like the <UNK> on the hills br br but hey at least the <UNK> pretty
<START> total disgrace truly awful the screenplay and dialogue is a joke and combined with a director who doesn't have a clue about life in <UNK> <UNK> it's not a surprise quite <UNK> film ha the director is palestinian canadian the writer is <UNK> the lead actress is <UNK> and the shooting took place in <UNK> and all those elements show very well to make the film far from representing the <UNK> society yes it contains some <UNK> <UNK> the stuff we see in cartoons in the <UNK> everyday but that's about everything the film had the opportunity to show real problem with <UNK> society or at least give us something new and genuine about the youth troubles and concerns in <UNK> <UNK> instead it copied and <UNK> from here and there and the result was a mess even the supposedly love story in the movie doesn't exist or at least we haven't seen it the only bright side in this total <UNK> is some good acting from the supporting cast the veteran <UNK> was funny in a badly written role as the grand father which he is clearly got <UNK> for he looks younger than the actor who plays his son also the actor who plays the fanatic brother's role al has done well in fact he was the best actor in the film the rest of the cast being professionals for long did an ok job but the lead actor was just bad he had one look of a little adorable bobby for all situations he couldn't even say his lines in a proper manner he has charisma that made him win the title of star academy a very famous reality show and he is good in interviews and tv shows but he was just the weakest link of this film the lead actress i didn't mind very much but even she acted badly in some scenes and <UNK> her <UNK> in <UNK> way br br the film was a huge hit <UNK> <UNK> in thousands to <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to attend it when it was screened there and it made a tone of money then it was screened in pay per view then in <UNK> tv and that was in a span of a few weeks this was to cash on <UNK> to <UNK> entertainment but alas the film was neither <UNK> nor entertaining
<START> some <UNK> aliens off on a distant ship from a distant planet have sent the giant robot <UNK> to rob the world of its energy they've got a prototype around mexico for <UNK> and if he proves successful more will be sent it would certainly take a lot of time for just this one <UNK> to perform that task br br for reasons i can't explain the aliens first capture the mind of leading scientist john <UNK> who <UNK> directs <UNK> to his first targets since <UNK> is killed off later and the monster seems to function well enough without <UNK> as a <UNK> why the aliens needed him in the first place is a bit bizarre br br in any event scientists jeff <UNK> barbara lawrence and george <UNK> who work under <UNK> aren't fooled a bit about his nature and of course they come up with a plan to deal with the raging metal giant br br <UNK> is a perfect film for the fifties the bad guys are never seen they're just out there looking to <UNK> mankind it's a perfect film for the cold war and jeff <UNK> <UNK> us we'll be ready for them in the future br br the players look like they're having a grand old time <UNK> as many clich√©d lines the writers could put in the script i get the impression that <UNK> is the kind of film ed wood might have done on a bigger budget with a bit more care
<START> i saw this movie for the first time when quentin tarantino showed it to a bunch of us at the <UNK> in austin he <UNK> it with how freaking awesome he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation it was hilarious i can see how it would be <UNK> to some audiences and the subject is not funny at all but there are at least three lines in the film that had me laughing so hard i thought i'd pee they don't come until after the halfway point but when they do oh god you will die oh and jim brown is brilliant he's not in a lot of the movie but when he's there you know whose movie it is naturally the best line in the movie and the funniest is his you'll know it when you hear it
<START> i found myself watching sex lives of the <UNK> men with a <UNK> brow puzzled why so many talented and witty comedians decided to be involved in a film so totally devoid of humour br br poo and <UNK> jokes are funny when you're eleven <UNK> plus and you begin to lose friends around the water <UNK> br br maybe some enjoyment could be had from this movie if you're the kind of person who frequently plays practical jokes involving dog mess brown <UNK> and matches or maybe <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> on nights out by vomit <UNK> etc when you're not back at your <UNK> basement <UNK> your teenage wife br br even then sex lives it's hard to recommend perhaps if you're really <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> surgery and spend your <UNK> happy <UNK> the elderly or watching <UNK> <UNK> you might think a close up of a <UNK> is worthy of cinematic distribution br br i'd discuss characterisation narrative or performances had i not <UNK> completely out following the lengthy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> comparison
<START> this is halfway to being a top movie the opening section which spoofs hollywood social message films is absolutely brilliant it is a riot from start to finish br br the second section which introduces us to the main characters of the story is really great too we get a lot of great comic <UNK> top notch performances and the dialog is really dynamic br br spoiler warning br br the one think that really annoyed me about this film though is the ending which i think <UNK> everything that went before my interpretation was that this film was taking the mickey out all the silly prejudices and innuendo of small town <UNK> and national <UNK> <UNK> i loved that the film was <UNK> the cause that a person's sexuality is not determined by their <UNK> <UNK> fashion sense or whatever and then the ending goes and re <UNK> all the <UNK> and stereotypes that the movie successfully <UNK> in the first place it turns out everyone was 100 right this was very disappointing to what was actually a great story
<START> a very interesting documentary certainly a lot more than <UNK> a pseudo <UNK> drama where the <UNK> conspiracy is revealed in all its greed according to the documentary and confirmed by the recent <UNK> of a biography on parker only two men <UNK> the nature of in the world robert parker of and michel a french wine industry expert based in <UNK> and also known as a flying the director is clever enough to insert interviews of local wine producers from many different <UNK> of france from <UNK> to <UNK> and interviews of the biggest players in the industry such as the family to <UNK> the <UNK> on the <UNK> of wine making and marketing a must see for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial act after watching this well made
<START> going by the good words of my friends i hired this movie hoping that it would at least equal the laughs of the similar movie house party but i was very disappointed and very bored br br falling asleep while watching a movie is never a good sign i don't know whether this didn't appeal to me because i don't live in da hood or if i'm not black but it's probably one of the two br br it tries to spoof a few movies only coming up with a couple of laughs but in the long run it fails miserably miss it
<START> why is it that virtual x rated video game women can speak through their mouths but virtual fighting game champion <UNK> has to use a combination of <UNK> and over dramatic facial expressions i feel that either they needed to cast someone who looked more villain like michael big brown <UNK> eyes don't exactly strike fear in the hearts of well anyone except for maybe casting directors who consistently cast him as either a villain or a heroic <UNK> <UNK> or they needed to just let him use his real voice and move his mouth and maybe give him a costume that would not make him stick out like a sore thumb when walking down the street but of course this is the future and we must assume that bad fashion taste is considered the norm
<START> some things just won't stay dead they just have to keep coming back for more whether we like it or not i guess some people like to beat a dead horse the first <UNK> was a surprise hit and it's first sequel was an even better film the third film took a more comical approach and by this point the little were starting to <UNK> their welcome i guess someone out there in hollywood thought it was a bright idea to <UNK> the franchise but the outcome will likely disappoint fans of the previous entries br br pros the acting is actually pretty good for a movie like this a silly but fun score moves at an alright pace some cheese for those who love it some pretty good action packed sequences has a bit more plot than the others and unlike ii iii at least attempts to link itself with the original br br cons not nearly as much fun as it's predecessors though it has more plot than before it's a pretty ridiculous one poor effects the original <UNK> only appear in flashbacks and here they're replaced with two <UNK> who serve no purpose other than to be comic <UNK> speaking of comedy all attempts at humor are lame is a direct sequel to the first film but there are so many loose ends for example i thought jonathan was done with black magic after what happened in the original not that it was spectacular in the others but this film's direction is especially bland br br final thoughts the first three <UNK> movies are a bad movie <UNK> dream this fourth and so far final sequel let's hope is a bit of a letdown sure there's some fun to be had but it just isn't the same the others are low budget too but the people involved put a lot more into them see if you're a <UNK> or you wanna see beautiful women in skimpy outfits otherwise just stick with the other three br br my rating 2 5
<START> one of the worst movie i have seen in 2009 so far the story <UNK> between a silly thriller or a dumb comedy br br as <UNK> happens the void is filled with long boring dialogs that don't make any sense br br the cast is famous but doesn't bring any emotions except to fast forward the play br br and it happens in a <UNK> <UNK> hotel that looks really gloomy in comparison the one of the shining is <UNK> br br <UNK> a lot of users think that it is located in the french <UNK> they are wrong it isn't the south of france nice cannes but totally the opposite <UNK> to be simple the <UNK> of the d day that's why the sea is as grey as the sky and there isn't sun
<START> i literally ran to watch it expecting a film that will make me cry or touch my heart br br what i found was not heart <UNK> but a lame exploitation of 1 strong human character br br between a pair of young lesbians and an <UNK> man br br in a setting that is <UNK> devoid of sound not to mention acting of the most common br br it was not entirely bad as i have seen worst and i left the cinema 10 <UNK> but <UNK> that a film well advertised is not the same as a film well made
<START> i went to see <UNK> with high hopes because the director's shower had impressed me so despite a few <UNK> into shower ranks high on my list of all time favorite movies for its <UNK> insight into family relationships and its generally superb acting and direction and i've seen it at least three times now br br but <UNK> fell flat in my <UNK> it seemed a pointless exercise and i was quickly so tired of the main character's <UNK> personality that i was longing for the movie to end i admit to falling asleep six or seven times but it was only for a few seconds at a time so i think it's still ok to write this comment br br i did admire the parents and sister the device of using all real characters in the film is a nice one i've never seen used before br br disappointment aside i will still make an effort to see any film bearing <UNK> <UNK> name simply on the basis of the beautiful shower
<START> i rented this movie because i am a huge <UNK> fan i figured it couldn't be that bad boy was i wrong at the 15 minute mark i was the others to let me rip the dvd out and <UNK> it back to the rental store but they refused they <UNK> it had to get better br br they were wrong this movie was lacking everything the actors delivered their lines with as much emotion as a <UNK> rock the plot was ridiculous and i was offended that hollywood assumed people were dumb enough to enjoy it none of the characters <UNK> very well with each other ice t gives one of his worst performances here br br after watching footage of the wrong plane bad guys standing up to get shot and clips being <UNK> and missing everything i wanted to scream and bang my head on <UNK> the movie hit its <UNK> of ignorance when the people on the space station used an elevator to travel space suits are not needed and there is gravity in space regardless of what real <UNK> may say br br i didn't finish this movie and hated it i don't want to finish this movie this is slow suicide i could feel my cerebral planning to avenge the torture i put it through
<START> how do you take a cast of experienced well known actors and put together such a stupid movie has the answer <UNK> six co workers at an <UNK> car business decide to steal a large <UNK> of cash themselves but just as they get to first base with their plans everything <UNK> quickly with a plot like this you'd think it couldn't be too bad at least for an action movie however in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be 6 normal everyday kind of guys they joke they laugh have a few drinks together etc then we suddenly learn they're planning to rob their own business the hero <UNK> <UNK> short is sucked into the scheme because of the cold cruel world even though he's a <UNK> veteran nice guy and reliable employee oh my oh my then in the last 40 minutes of the film these former regular guys nearly all turn into money crazed <UNK> willing to butcher each other for cash in the last scenes mike matt dillon goes on a <UNK> rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend the viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and <UNK> it's utterly unbelievable and b movie is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot i would say don't waste your time too bad no one gave laurence fishburne jean reno or fred ward the same advice before making this picture
<START> well if you set aside the fact that this movie features abysmal acting and if you set aside the fact that the story is muddled and wanders off in about five different directions without ever deciding which way it really wants to go and if you set aside the fact that i didn't find a single scene in this movie that was remotely interesting well if you set all that aside this is still a really terrible movie br br i take it that this is supposed to be a love story about rich guy poor girl i never really understood for a moment how this romance between <UNK> chris <UNK> and samantha <UNK> <UNK> ever got started the inexplicable romance is made worse by a complete lack of chemistry between <UNK> and <UNK> the screenplay by michael is dull to the point of <UNK> how managed to write the thing without falling asleep is a miracle that he would think anyone would want to pay to see this is unbelievable br br did i mention that this is a really really terrible movie br br i'd give it a zero but the imdb doesn't provide for votes of zero so i give it a one while holding my nose
<START> it's dreadful but br br cat stevens fans are given the opportunity to see the woman who inspired the lovely song lady <UNK> on his album <UNK> bone before cat turned into a supporting religious <UNK>
<START> for sheer quality of performance and the theater of the absurd this one is hard to compare to anything else with the world melting down in the early '70s this film made perfect sense then and still <UNK> george scott could never be <UNK>
<START> the recent documentary the adventures of errol flynn is an in depth look at the ultimate hollywood hero bogart cagney wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screen images but flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner the younger son out to <UNK> out his own for a sword thunder and romance <UNK> that ironically he found himself trapped in if he hadn't been under contract to warner bros he would've of been perfect in the cary grant role in suspicion the good looking <UNK> whose 1000 <UNK> smile <UNK> one to the fact that he's a predator and he could've starred with his best leading ladies sister joan fontaine that was <UNK> trouble he was the ultimate screen hero until his own <UNK> and bad timing caught up with him grant and flynn in a way are similar but flynn was the more macho of the two it is possible to see grant as captain blood but flynn in the philadelphia story mr <UNK> builds his dream house or monkey business or operation <UNK> would've turned those roles on their collective ears because he's too damn sure on his feet and the sexual tension he would've brought naturally would've made the story lines <UNK> but this <UNK> biography is just a <UNK> view of flynn and his era there are times when i half expected a laugh track or an audience to go <UNK> at some point it doesn't go deeply into <UNK> life just the screen magazine view it also doesn't delve into his struggle to be considered more than a <UNK> <UNK> like the <UNK> up <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> the father not the <UNK> or <UNK> of mice and men and buster keaton done in the <UNK> this is just a time killing piece of fluff
<START> i first saw this film when i was in the <UNK> grade and i remember that it had a profound affect on me then i saw in again about a year ago i am now <UNK> and it still moved me in similar ways this is a great movie that <UNK> the struggle of principle vs <UNK> character is the <UNK> teacher that won't give in to any racist <UNK> of the <UNK> mr that story also <UNK> the struggle of how older people often resist change and more specifically cultural change often at the expense of children when these battles finally come to a <UNK> pat <UNK> loses and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or does it the children that he has to leave are better off for knowing him more exposed to the real world and to classical music the other teacher at the school gained respect for him and he learned much about himself a great film with a heart breaking ending i <UNK> that anyone who enjoyed the film to read the book the water is wide by pat <UNK> it will stay with you
<START> the first time i ever saw this movie was when i was four years old i remember loving it and everything about it 13 years later i am now 17 and decided to watch it about a month ago because i am taking a 1960's class in school i didn't really know what to expect since it had been 13 years since i last saw it but i was completely blown away by it the actors were amazing the music was so fun and i now find myself singing along to every song treat williams is great as <UNK> the leader of the hippie group who always gets what he wants one way or another except for at the very end of course john savage is actually very convincing as claude the <UNK> who falls in love with sheila beverly <UNK> <UNK> is lovely as the <UNK> and proper rich girl who eventually rebels against her upbringing and joins the hippies the other hippies are played by annie golden don and <UNK> wright annie golden is just adorable as <UNK> the girl who is pregnant but still as cute and innocent as a child don and <UNK> wright are good as <UNK> and <UNK> the other two members of the group and <UNK> barnes who plays fianc√©e has an amazing voice br br the only problem i have with this movie however is that the relationship between claude and sheila is not very convincing they are barely ever shown together and when they are they fight remember the skinny <UNK> scene it seems as though their relationship is very weak and by the end of the movie we are supposed to believe they are <UNK> in love only based on the few <UNK> they had i also see that many people writing reviews here are upset by the pg rating this movie has i personally would raise the rating up to a pg 13 only because there is some drug use but remember in 1979 pg 13 didn't exist i don't think the nudity is bad at all it is in no way sexual in fact there isn't really any sex at all in this movie and it is only to show the <UNK> innocence that the group maintains in most european countries nudity isn't regarded as something bad and i don't see why it is here in the us anyways i give this movie a high rating and i'm glad it was made back then because in the insanely politically correct world of today they wouldn't even think of making it and even if they did it would be a very watered down version and i'm sure you wouldn't get the full effect br br in conclusion this is a very underrated film that is definitely worth checking out
<START> i went to see this movie today with hopes that it would involve an at least half intelligent story i was extremely disappointed as it did not the plot and the decisions by the main character were so far fetched i was hoping for a dog day afternoon type movie but instead got something totally <UNK> i actually found myself totally hoping for the hero to be knocked off and i nearly walked out of the theater on several occasions when this should have happened but didn't heist movies are to be feel good flicks and this one tried to be just that every couple of minutes during the second half of the movie i found myself saying no way without giving the whole story away it <UNK> around an <UNK> car guard who was <UNK> down and out and whose house was going into <UNK> he was invited in on a heist and accepted only to back down once the action began weak
<START> i had no idea what i was going to see when i decided to view this film and to my surprise its just an extremely well made horror film that is easily one of the best of the 1970's film is of course low budget and this is an excellent example of how the story and style of a film creates chills not special effects martin is one of the great character actors of all time and he has a rare starring role here and the film also stars <UNK> good friend l q jones and green <UNK> moore jones and moore helped produce this film as well tv veteran charles <UNK> is the star and enter the dragon beauty <UNK> is his girlfriend <UNK> is in a bikini at the beginning of the film and she's just gorgeous to look at film does a terrific job of staying with the story and not adding a phony feel good ending and i really liked the way the film ends great atmosphere interesting story and well directed by bernard <UNK> performance is top notch also as he doesn't hold back at all and really throws himself into the role of doc good and underrated film
<START> we've just watched the last of the series shown on the <UNK> network and will miss our weekly dose of danish delight my wife and i picked up the show after the swedish show the eagle finished and it seemed by comparison to be a very poor substitute for our then favourite show on tv week by week however the show grew on me and whilst not as glossy as the swedish show and definitely <UNK> in terms of their <UNK> of everyday crimes it certainly provided a very satisfying weekly viewing meal indeed br br prior to these 2 shows i had not really been a fan of the cop genre and can't say i am now but the 2 <UNK> shows really provided us with an insight into life in those northern countries through the eyes of their special <UNK> <UNK>
<START> jess franco makes exploitation films and he has made tons of them franco is responsible for some of the most shocking films in cinema history and god bless him for it unfortunately the <UNK> of is a truly awful movie that is not up to his usual standards br br exploitation films should be judged on story sex and gore what else is there this film fails on most of those <UNK> the plot is paper thin placing a <UNK> young girl in the jungle among cannibals we really don't get information on why she and her father were there in the first place as expected her father is the big white chief and she becomes a <UNK> sitting in trees naked add fortune hunters and precious stones and you have your basic rescue the girl for greedy intentions plot line the characters are stock not adding an ounce of believability to the proceedings br br gore none or at least very little this film is often mentioned in the same vein as the classic italian cannibal movies those seeking that type of gore need to run the other way save for one cheap be heading this movie features surprisingly little blood and guts br br as best i can tell the only reason this movie exists is so <UNK> mess and <UNK> carmen could run around naked actually <UNK> <UNK> carmen does the full frontal heavy <UNK> while the two jungle ladies are bare <UNK> throughout yes there are love scenes probably the most <UNK> franco has ever <UNK> the women are beautiful but nothing here to really make this movie an erotic classic either br br this movie just <UNK> of low budget <UNK> the sets are laughable the acting is horrid and the editing is confusing there is no real story to hold this together and not enough of a budget or effort to shock or <UNK> i think franco fans have come to expect more out of the master of exploitation
<START> it's not funny it's not interesting it's not well shot you don't care about the characters not one single one of them there's nothing that <UNK> you in the narrative flow you really could care less what happens big big waste of time and talent
<START> this flick is strange but i liked it a lot its about a good girl who loves her bad boy and their messed up honeymoon he doesn't love her back and he's a mean son of a bitch he starts to love her after some really whacked stuff happens on their honeymoon i wont give it away its weird yeah but different than other movies in a good way i think i don't know what to compare it to but its a love story but has lots of funny stuff too like get to see james franco in a wig i liked the <UNK> a lot and it kinda felt like that because of the love story but the rest is way different nothing like that <UNK> miller is really good i saw this movie at a test <UNK> because i like her a lot and her fashion i liked her in factory girl but this is a better movie than that was her and james franco look really in love in this movie and i hope they are together in real life but don't know br br see it
<START> i disagree with the imdb com synopsis that this is about a <UNK> guy preparing to get married it's more about all the crap we go through self induced and because of our parents that we have to get over when we grow up like the linda poem says childhood is the barrel they throw you over the falls in this movie is much more like a narrative poem it's about life and the mistakes we make and hurt we <UNK> and experience over the years and how in the end it's all about love i'm not trying to be hyper sensitive or and finding and being with one special person
<START> one only has to read the cast list and credits to <UNK> in anticipation of this david <UNK> but alas alas how so much major acting and directorial talent could have turned one of <UNK> <UNK> tales into such a monumental bore is totally beyond me it's pretty to look at with lovely photography particularly the sequences but just plain dull no need to go on skip it and check out the <UNK> or the marvelous bbc mini series from the 1980's
<START> this is definitely an outstanding 1944 musical with great young stars and famous veteran actors under the direction of charles <UNK> rita hayworth rusty parker charlie chan in egypt sang and <UNK> with gene kelly danny <UNK> anchors away danny <UNK> owned a night club in brooklyn n y and was in love with rusty parker who was a dancer in his club along with phil <UNK> genius <UNK> island who was the comedian in this picture and also worked and dance together with danny rusty otto <UNK> john duel in the sun played the role as a <UNK> of a cover girl magazine and decided rusty parker was going to be his top model <UNK> music is heard through out the entire picture and the song long ago far away is the theme music for this musical this film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during <UNK> ii which kept peoples minds off of the war that was going on at the time rita hayworth and gene kelly were instant hits and their <UNK> <UNK> on the silver screen for many many years great musical and a film you will not want to miss this is truly a great classic film enjoy
<START> <UNK> flower is what i call a pizza movie a personal favorite that never fails to satisfy perfect for an evening at home with a pizza knowing all the lines and what lines by heart only enhances the enjoyment br br since so many others here have <UNK> the plot i'll simply add the <UNK> that <UNK> character miss dickinson was a nurse <UNK> meaning she was a skilled nurse and therefore an educated person not just a <UNK> br br <UNK> performance in this film and the film itself was largely <UNK> at the time but today's audiences will marvel at her range not just the impeccable comic timing but the ability to make us believe her character is unaware of her own feelings while revealing them so clearly to toni and to us while the general plot stretches credibility <UNK> performance is compelling honest and utterly believable br br also a standout is jack <UNK> performance as the <UNK> old friend and co <UNK> harvey no one could deliver a <UNK> like <UNK> and i a l <UNK> script gives him plenty for example that's such a big dirty rotten lie it has class <UNK> <UNK> at slightly seedy characters because he <UNK> a warmth that allowed you to forgive his characters' flaws br br the film is a fairly straight adaptation of the <UNK> <UNK> play which was itself adapted from a french play by and on broadway <UNK> role was played by barry nelson <UNK> by lauren bacall and <UNK> by brenda <UNK> it ran for 1 performances three years and was nominated for two tony awards <UNK> and burt who played <UNK> br br for me the film's score written and adapted by the legendary <UNK> jones is another highlight the main theme a time for love is anytime is performed by sarah vaughn over the opening and closing credits it is also <UNK> in different <UNK> throughout the film most notably as the romantic piano music <UNK> speech to hawn in the record store jones also created covers of popular songs from the period to sir with love i'm a believer for the night club scenes as with all of the film's elements there is a tremendous amount of talent taste and <UNK> evident br br in my opinion few modern romantic comedies can hold a candle to this classic it's great to finally have it available on dvd time to call for a pizza
<START> i rented the china syndrome recently mainly because i read that it was this film that inspired abc to make the day after syndrome however is more of a thriller than a drama the film is quite political but i agree strongly with its message nuclear power though extremely efficient is far too dangerous for common use the risks are simply too high hopefully the persons in charge of real nuclear plants are far more responsible and <UNK> than those depicted in the film however given that the real life near disaster at three mile island happened mere months after this film was released puts that in question in fairness that case was probably more one of incompetence than of corruption br br syndrome is not just critical of nuclear power but also of modern news media similar in vein to network only much more serious being a print journalist myself i am quite familiar with how people perceive the media but it was a little frightening to see that even in the <UNK> tv news was already selling out when jane <UNK> character tries to convince her boss to let her do real news instead of fluff she is advised not to try the change as research finds that people prefer a pretty girl to do fluff not hard news br br what truly makes the film memorable however is the incredible suspense generated in its final third during this period the viewer is constantly <UNK> for the lives of the protagonists whether the danger is coming from hired thugs or the potential <UNK> of the nuclear plant and that very last scene i won't give it away of course but it will keep you guessing br br on a final note i did get a distinct feel watching the film that it seemed at times more like a tv movie than a true theatrical film this could be however due more to the fact that the rental tape i was watching was quite old and not <UNK> to fit tv screens the way videos and dvds are today
<START> yet another lo <UNK> production to completely waste the talents of a young jackie chan to kill with intrigue is a strange mix of <UNK> melodrama supernatural action and plain old school kung fu fighting that is pretty dull despite featuring several surreal wtf moments and lots of laughably bad dialogue br br in an effort to protect his pregnant girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> from the killer <UNK> a gang of ruthless killers that are about to attack his home <UNK> jackie chan pretends to be a heartless <UNK> driving her away and thus saving her from danger br br during the attack relatives are all killed but he is left relatively <UNK> by the gang whose leader a <UNK> faced woman seems to have the <UNK> for him then goes in search of <UNK> <UNK> whose safety he has <UNK> to his close friend <UNK> <UNK> br br during his quest to find his true love befriends the head of a <UNK> company whose precious <UNK> has been stolen by the leader of the evil <UNK> <UNK> clan eventually after being injured in a fight against members of the nasty clan a fun scene with lots of silly <UNK> and then <UNK> back to health by the <UNK> faced killer <UNK> who shows her love by burning his face ultimately learns that he is a lousy judge of character his friend <UNK> <UNK> is none other than the power hungry head <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> clan who has plans to marry <UNK> <UNK> himself br br cue the drawn out climactic battle with getting kicked in the face repeatedly before eventually <UNK> his <UNK> ex pal to death with a <UNK> br br even die hard chan fans will find this one a chore to sit through with only the final fight managing to showcase some of the <UNK> amazing <UNK> abilities fans of general asian weirdness might dig the spooky appearance of the killer <UNK> at the beginning of the film with one character inexplicably demanding back his severed hand or the moment when three men <UNK> through a window to attack our hero but for most this film will have very limited appeal
<START> this movie had great production values good lighting costumes set cinematography and acting but someone somewhere took the script and replaced all the dialogue with grade school level barely <UNK> writing i felt my iq dropping points any time any character spoke br br did they do this on purpose was this just an accident of brain dead studio executives at this point we don't know br br all i know is this movie was one great mistake from beginning to end we don't even get to see how the squad became cops so instead of any character development we get what feels like a bad tv movie <UNK> from the 60's or whenever br br find the screenwriters beat them with a <UNK> full of quarters everyone else nice work but read your scripts next time br br 3 10
<START> everyone has their choice for worst movie they've ever seen some like to pick on <UNK> or battlefield earth some pick on classics like plan 9 from outer space ever since i was 14 i have been very vocal in saying that to me it is problem child 2 and 9 years later i feel the exact same way it's not one of the worst it's not just an expression it is the actual worst movie i have ever seen br br how much <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> can you put in a single movie i don't need to see a dog take a dump that goes up to my <UNK> why is it that i'm so hard on this filth i have nothing against bathroom or gross out humor heck i like the american pie movies having such an excess of it within 90 minutes is a bad idea but the true <UNK> point is to do it with kids having little kids call each other sexual names imdb won't even let me post that word on here yet here it is coming out of the mouths of 8 year olds think of the irony in that and <UNK> and <UNK> on each other just makes the whole thing feel <UNK> worst line in the movie i guess i should fart in more people's <UNK> br br what other film has <UNK> into <UNK> dynamite sticks exploding <UNK> a little boy filming his babysitter having sex and <UNK> it on the side of the house and a little girl joking about scratching <UNK> br br however my absolute favorite moment has to be when the same little girl is on a carnival ride says i'm gonna <UNK> opens her mouth and fake looking <UNK> shoots straight out of her open mouth in a perfect 90 degree angle the <UNK> scene in scary movie 2 looked more real than that br br i suppose the only redeeming element in the movie is gilbert <UNK> you get the impression that he didn't even have a script but was just being his usual self too bad he has to act stupid while pizza gets thrown on him br br you know what thinking about the movie this much has just made me have to go to the bathroom goodbye
<START> here's the spoiler at the end of the movie a little piece of you dies you'll spend the rest of your life searching in vain for that missing piece but it's gone it's gone you'll wander the streets at night <UNK> into your windows as they sit down for dinner friends and family will try to <UNK> when exactly you turned into the walking dead you'll answer their questions and concerns with a blank stare and some <UNK> about a runaway <UNK> when <UNK> inevitably makes the movie of the month a series of mysterious murders will take place in your city you'll wake up the next morning <UNK> up on the floor of the kitchen with a faint taste of brains in your mouth then you'll crawl into the living room and onto the couch you'll stare at the wall wet yourself a little and then begin to laugh <UNK> because once your dead inside jake busey in a <UNK> is actually pretty damn funny
<START> my <UNK> childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult <UNK> of in the french 60's so i was eager to see the big screen adaptation i should have kept my money and gone for a <UNK> in the <UNK> br br the idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting the of le <UNK> but the adaptation is ridiculous the dialogues hesitate <UNK> between french irony and serious american business without achieving neither but not without sounding <UNK> br br acting leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are <UNK> compared to what one could expect low budget br br what is left of all that not much outside a few good shots of paris which is seldom a disappointment br br was worth more than that br br
<START> it's not as good as the movie that said it's a cute kids show okay so the emperor has back slide and become a selfish spoiled brat once more accept it and enjoy the cartoon as something entertaining it has plenty of jokes for the parents and still holds the attention of children also it boasts two of the original voice actors from the movie earth <UNK> who has been in numerous films but i'm sure many people know as <UNK> and patrick sorry if i <UNK> who also has appeared in many films and tv series but is most widely recognized as the <UNK> it's really a rare and wonderful combination if for no other reason i highly recommend comic book fans watch at least one episode just to enjoy the dynamic duo to sum up entertaining children's show with plenty of inside jokes for the grown ups to laugh along with if your looking for educational value this isn't your show if your just looking for something funny this is a great saturday morning pick
<START> back in 2002 when matthew lawrence did the hot chick i also saw <UNK> that day <UNK> wins by <UNK> if the had been released in march as planned the same time <UNK> was released <UNK> would've won by <UNK> br br granted matthew lawrence did a fine job portraying a <UNK> he didn't have to resort to <UNK> dirty words which is a plus but when he started playing with his private parts as well as another football players and touching a girl's <UNK> those were the <UNK> br br but the biggest minus that <UNK> me off is that every football player got to participate in the mock music video except matthew lawrence insert the price is <UNK> losing <UNK> another blown musical opportunity for him just because he's shy about doing music br br in the past matt has disappointed me many times super human samurai squad where he came so close to having a musical moment but ended up failing br br sure joey had a singing career with two albums to his belt and <UNK> starting a music career of his own but it's very rare to find a matt musical moment the two that stand out would be on <UNK> love where he played the guitar and sang <UNK> on your car art which he wrote by the way and that romantic boy meets world moment when he sang this dame as time goes by br br matt you've played <UNK> too long why not make a musical comeback you have a good voice and i miss your musical side
<START> it's another variation on the <UNK> told tale of two people getting married and having to share their <UNK> of kids with six you get egg roll is directed by howard morris from television and it shows because it's the kind of tale that plays like a half hour situation comedy padded out to feature film length but with a <UNK> of laughs or to put it differently only the number of laughs that would have been possible within the half hour limits of a tv show br br doris day decided to call it <UNK> after this film and it's rather easy to see why even the presence of some fairly reliable actors in the cast doesn't help brian keith barbara <UNK> pat <UNK> and alice do their best but the script is the real problem and should have been left <UNK> for the big screen br br nothing much can be said in favor of it skip it and see miss day in any number of her more worthwhile films
<START> forget the fact that most people expect an action movie form seagal this movie simply had no substance very long drawn out and boring scenes were much longer than they had to be the camera would often focus on something for long periods of time when absolutely nothing was happening cure for insomnia worst seagal movie by far i do like some of his other movies 1 10
<START> after i read that the time of its release in 2002 its budget of <UNK> million or 000 000 <UNK> was said to make it the french film ever however et <UNK> <UNK> 1999 had a budget of 48 million or <UNK> 000 <UNK> which supposedly made it the most expensive french film i discovered the reason why i found this movie to be one of the most beautiful and colorful of all i have ever seen i loved the scenarios the clothes specially the ones from <UNK> and the atmosphere of the movie it's so happy and cheerful i found the jokes smart and hilarious and i have to consider this movie to be in my favorite comedies of all times br br the cast is also excellent with monica <UNK> who is very beautiful as <UNK> <UNK> depardieu great christian <UNK> that i saw for the first time in among others br br i recommend this movie even for people who doesn't know <UNK> and comics you are going to have a great amount of fun br br aka <UNK> e brazil

<START> fun movie great for the kids they found it very entertaining somewhat predictable but there are a few surprises great movie to watch if you're looking for something just to entertain don't expect to be seeing a classic
<START> it <UNK> to be the life of paul the <UNK> it opens with him involved in a <UNK> cloth wrestling match with a priest the <UNK> were called that because they separated themselves from the being forced upon the jews by their <UNK> <UNK> the point is that <UNK> would never have been involved in <UNK> roman wrestling period br br then we have the two men <UNK> and the priest <UNK> a totally extra biblical <UNK> character shown being washed down in the nude in a roman style bath house again the <UNK> which <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> condemned in the strongest possible terms looking upon the <UNK> of another man br br <UNK> is shown being the one that pushes <UNK> into destroying the church again the text of <UNK> doesn't matter for their it is paul that says that he laid waste of the church and <UNK> out and slaughter against the church br br the movie shows <UNK> paul not <UNK> him when the text of <UNK> says it was that did it br br their is no mention of mark or his turning back so the writers of the script are forced to have paul and argue over paul's desire to <UNK> in rome as the basis of their <UNK> br br no <UNK> on paul's second and third missions no timothy ever no <UNK> no no no <UNK> james is said to have known jesus for a long time rather than it saying as the text of <UNK> does that he is <UNK> brother br br why not just call the movie frank the <UNK> <UNK> at least that would be closer to the text of <UNK>
<START> elizabeth ashley is receiving phone calls from her nephew michael he's crying screaming and asking for help the problem is michael died 15 years ago br br this film scared me silly back in 1972 when it aired on abc seeing it again years later it still works br br the movie is a little slow and predictable the deaths are very tame and there's a tacked on happy ending but this is a tv movie so you have to give it room elizabeth ashley is excellent ben <UNK> is ok and it's fun to see michael douglas so young and those <UNK> calls still scare the living <UNK> out of me i actually had to turn a light on during one of them br br a creepy little tv movie worth seeing
<START> garden state must rate amongst the most contrived and pretentious films of all time the plot is a simple one involving a young man returning home after his mother's death and discovering love but really the plot isn't important what is important to <UNK> writer director and star ¬ñ is that he is able to hang from the plot all the necessary of an or <UNK> film we therefore are presented with endless cute and quirky characters and scenes that don't exist for reasons of plot or character development but simply to give some artistic credibility to the film <UNK> la wes anderson or so hopes unfortunately and somewhat astonishingly has not only fooled many on imdb but also some critics who really ought to have known better br br of course gratuitous use of the quirky alone does not make garden state a bad film what really makes garden state a stinker is script he simply does not have the writing skills to carry this film off and the dialogue and characterisation are abysmal often has to resort to blunt <UNK> and symbolism to achieve what he can't achieve through the writing for example the <UNK> of the character is shown to us by his indifference to an impending plane crash this can't be worked into the plot and so has to take place in a dream later he is shown fighting back against his circumstances by screaming into a <UNK> <UNK> life a <UNK> <UNK> very clever mr those two scenes must rank amongst the most ludicrous and contrived ever seen on a cinema screen br br on the plus side the acting is passable despite the lack of material for the cast to work with by which i mean a script and i do admire natalie portman for her efforts as the love interest a character so badly written and implausible that she is little more than a mindless doll that <UNK> into his fantasy woman br br it apparently took 3 years to write the script for garden state 3 years to write a script this bad he really is inept hopefully therefore it will be some time before he makes another film
<START> how much longer are we to <UNK> with this flawed belief that once a director produces great ground breaking work all future work can't be all that bad after all he made such and such br br <UNK> drive is a case in point and is in fact <UNK> rubbish the performances are excellent particularly from <UNK> and <UNK> but a good film they do not necessarily make what lynch has clearly forgotten is that just making a film unnecessarily <UNK> only works when it takes the audience by surprise when the audience is expecting the film to not make sense then the film has to have some substance to keep the audience interested lynch succeeds in the first half of the film with the murder mystery set up with lots of twists and red herrings and then <UNK> the story into a <UNK> of bizarre and pointless <UNK> <UNK> lynch realised how muddled the film was becoming and threw in the lesbian and scenes to the audience awake and to stop the male viewers from standing up and leaving br br watching the film at the preview i was surrounded by who had no more idea of what was going on than i did but left the theatre commenting on the layers and layers of lynch's film making excuse me but these people are the same <UNK> who stand in art <UNK> staring at that have been painted white commenting on the courage of the artist at painting such a brave work br br films like these are made because a lynch is <UNK> on his previous work and b because people convince themselves that film is art and therefore must be good i a number of the about what they actually liked in the film and only response i <UNK> that wasn't a broad layers type of answer was that they liked it when the chicks got their <UNK> off br br <UNK> said
<START> i'm sure some people will enjoy it and find it powerful or have some sort of personal connection with the characters and story but from an <UNK> stand point it's not very well done the film revolves around <UNK> angst ridden teenagers each one playing out a different stereotype making us believe this is what it's like to be a teenager we get to see a bit of each <UNK> lifestyle but the entire project just came off as pretentious to me whether it be the constant low angle shots of tree <UNK> in the wind or the black and white interviews with the students there was nothing new or original <UNK> in this movie and nothing i needed to see yes it deals with some strong subject material and the dramatic scenes are played and acted well but the entire project seems unnecessary especially when it seems almost an exact <UNK> to van <UNK> elephant one dealing with suicide the other with a school shooting as i said some people will probably enjoy this and the director writer clearly had some sort of inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a close one so it's nice the movie was made with some heart in it but i feel it's incredibly <UNK> and when dealing with material that can be so easily clich√©d to do something original with it i would not recommend this movie
<START> if you are a bit <UNK> and like to waste some time you should try this one i wasted enough time myself watching it so i will waste no more explaining why it is so awful be warned oh i see that i have to fill 10 lines or more here we go every year or so some people think it is fun to start shooting a low budget film about the scary monsters of the underground that hopefully will prove to be some sort of a hit the <UNK> is one of those i didn't have high expectations about this one but the acting is so bad and the production so poor that i'm seriously thinking of asking for a <UNK> one more line about a useless movie oh i'm done
<START> being from the buffalo area i was well aware of the movie having read many <UNK> in local <UNK> i was most impressed with the movie especially its clever plot the acting and the local scenes nice to see so many older quality stars in the various roles i feel that especially those of us over 50 will find the movie excellent and you can leave the theater feeling that your time was well spent
<START> all i can do is laugh wow i like jim movies i really do i mean <UNK> mall is a classic but this what happened to this guy he used to make funny horror movies that tried to be good but this was hardly even funny i mean i guess it was because i laughed the villain is incredible i mean horrible cgi it looks terrible and the movie has no gore and no nudity as redeeming qualities it is rated pg 13 a movie named bone eater you know won't be a blockbuster movie you know it probably won't have a smart script a movie like this may rely on gore but no it doesn't rely on anything really it's just crap check it out if you want to laugh though but don't expect a good movie i hope jim <UNK> goes back to movies like <UNK> mall and <UNK> iv because this and <UNK> vs <UNK> ain't cutting it
<START> ted made a lot of great horror and fantasy films i am looking for all his films to see i could not find this one for 3 year until i unexpectedly found it in youtube to tell the truth i wanted to see more ghosts and less talks here it looks like in 1999 2001 ted had a crisis maybe in money his features of this time look more like real low budget <UNK> z garbage movies but i do not claim him to be a bad director this time everything happens the ending has some nice creepy details and suspense but the whole film was long dull dialogues br br only for real ted's fans br br www <UNK> com
<START> some movies are off beat but enjoyable but many movies are just mind numbingly weird fits not so nicely in the latter category many seem to like it because of endless guest appearances and a total lack of sense but those two things can only take a movie so far and simply doesn't have any other merits to its credit br br <UNK> itself on plot <UNK> its main character gus is a <UNK> 10 year old on a <UNK> across an imaginary country trying to collect game pieces to win 500 million when <UNK> with adult figures none of them seem to notice or be concerned with the fact that he's 10 years old at first it's incredibly funny but it quickly becomes just too unbelievable especially considering the people he runs into and the fact that he seems so <UNK> by a lot of the disturbing to someone that age imagery going on around him gus has no depth and as an anti hero who has no problem causing misery for others to get his game pieces it's hard to feel sorry for him when he encounters trouble br br that trouble is provided by a slew of guest appearances each <UNK> gus in more and more strange ways besides making the already worn out plot even more unbelievable and less enjoyable the characters share lack of depth and are equally <UNK> the character's actions can get a little interesting but the actors themselves don't add anything to them thus <UNK> the whole point of getting big names they could've been played by anyone and the character would've been the same these guest appearances seem to have been signed more for <UNK> value than anything else br br should be interesting it's a unique idea but there's too little semblance of sense in the script for it to work incidents that should have a lasting effect on the anti hero and the viewer don't as the movie quickly moves from incident to incident in the hope that something will eventually make the audience feel sorry or understanding for gus that never happens as by doing so nothing is allowed to connect it just <UNK> back and forth as if on a <UNK> belt one incident after another with a story so nonsensical it <UNK> to be enjoyable and a main character who never <UNK> to care for himself or anyone else on a higher level has little to offer except a brat <UNK> around and trying to get rich why should we care about that
<START> after having problems in chicago the <UNK> family moves to a remote north <UNK> <UNK> to start <UNK> but their attempts at an <UNK> <UNK> life is <UNK> when their teen daughter jess <UNK> stewart and her 3 year old brother ben start seeing and being attacked by supernatural beings who won't allow them to live in peace br br the starts off <UNK> although it eventually becomes a generic horror film that's a lot more humorous than frightening after reading the premise i thought this could have been a decent movie since it sounded creepy and it held potential unfortunately the film didn't live up to its potential although i should have expected this since the trailer was awful the screenplay was probably the worst part about it it was full of silly sequences and bland dialog the characters were not developed at all and most of them were acting like a bunch of idiots so it was hard to feel sympathy for them br br the directors did a horrible job at building up suspense they mainly relied on cheap scares like loud noises and random jumps the music was really over the top and it just made it easier for the viewer to <UNK> the next scary moment i also didn't like how they pretty much just used one location for the whole movie the house was the <UNK> of the story and that's where the majority of the filming took place so it got a little boring after awhile to see the same area also i didn't like the close ups of the actors during a conversation the camera would continually jerk from character to another in the span of five seconds and it got really annoying the directors did create a decent atmosphere and they do get some points for making their movie stylish however since we have come a long way in terms of style and effects it's not really that hard to make your movie look nice especially if you are working on a hollywood film br br the acting was atrocious and if this movie had been released in december i'm sure it would have received several <UNK> nominations <UNK> stewart showed some talent in panic room but you wouldn't be able to tell she has talent by watching her performance in the she was okay at acting scared and that's it the rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing penelope anne miller was just awful when it came to everything it sounded like she was reading her lines and she had some of the worst facial expressions i have ever seen dylan mcdermott was just very wooden and he showed almost no emotion john corbett gave the best performance and he had a couple of good scenes the twins who played ben were also decent and managed to out act many of the adult actors overall this lame horror film is not worth watching because of it's <UNK> and lazy film making rating 4 10
<START> pretty pictures with a cool sound track do not <UNK> a <UNK> like all pop <UNK> <UNK> are are <UNK> only by its' <UNK> budget one dollar spent on this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was one dollar too many stick to <UNK> pop songs <UNK>
<START> everyone told me this movie was downright not good and sick etc so i finally rented it and i was amazed i thought the torture was gonna be much much worse but it did get shocking near the end but that was about it i wouldn't call it a horror movie maybe a mystery or something under the category of silence of the <UNK> and or kiss the girls it did get stupid at times but the rest of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat 7 10 br br rated r for strong torture violence language and sexuality
<START> i'm really surprised seeing all these positive reviews for this movie don't get me wrong it's not that i don't like kind of <UNK> br br while i very well can enjoy a good mindless hollywood action blockbuster like die hard 4 0 i like the <UNK> kind of movies or <UNK> life as it <UNK> movies just as much if they are well made br br a good example is 1998 no music no dramatic camera angles no special fx no fancy locations just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent movie br br is nine lives devoid of dramatic camera angles special fx and fancy locations yes is it a good movie i'm glad you asked br br the answer is absolutely not br br first of all everyone is raving about the acting performances i'm terribly sorry but you can act all you want but if the story and the dialogue is not believable the acting falls on its behind immediately and that is exactly the case with nine lives br br not once did i have the feeling while watching <UNK> <UNK> that i was watching real people having a real conversation i had the feeling i was watching actors trying to come across as <UNK> characters' while they were were saying things a <UNK> <UNK> would never say under the circumstances br br you can hardly call it a spoiler but there are some dialogue <UNK> below if you think that reading ten lines of ridiculous dialogue will ruin your movie experience stop reading here if you want a good laugh continue reading br br the dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was <UNK> you want examples plenty of those in <UNK> <UNK> br br br br picture this couple visits their filthy rich friends in their new mansion woman sees this castle of a house and says to her husband br br woman i could get used to this meaning the expensive house man don't woman why not it could be man no they are who they are and we are who we are woman i like the sound of that we are who we are br br she likes the sound of that her man is acting like a jerk but she likes the sound of that then an elderly couple walks past them holding hands this is what the woman comes up with br br woman look they are like children after school they lived through so much shared everything i love you br br they are like children after school and then the most <UNK> clich√© lines you ever heard finishing with 'i love <UNK> she says this while her man is being a jerk to her yes very logical very realistic not if anything this kind of dialogue made me wanna <UNK> some of the characters in the movie for saying these horrible horrible things br br example 2 br br elderly mom dad and younger daughter at a funeral dad i didn't realize andrew was religious mom it's for comfort daughter it's for strength mom life is fleeting dad and daughter burst out laughing br br yeah this one liner cracks me up any time especially at a funeral sorry i must have missed the joke here br br and it goes on and on and on br br how about the camera work don't even go there would be a compliment it supposed to come across as <UNK> instead you miss half of the actors facial expressions the only thing left to watch in this movie while half the time the camera is aimed at someone's back or side instead of the face br br conclusion well don't say i didn't warn you it's a good movie to rent if you want to make out with your date or something during the movie because you won't even care whether the movie is playing or not after the first five minutes br br overrated and more boring than watching grass grow kinda sums it up
<START> the story starts off in the home of a little girl who is going to have a birthday party and both the mother and father seemed to act rather quiet and reserved with each other they proceed to give their daughter her present which is from both of them and it stuck me funny the expressions on the two parents faces as they gave their child this gift it was almost like 'i hope she likes <UNK> there is a killing in the film and catherine mary stewart julia <UNK> 2000 gets involved with the case because of family ties julia is working hard to become a doctor and this particular murder <UNK> her entire life rob lowe kevin finney view from the top <UNK> is a next door neighbor in the same apartment <UNK> as julia and he eventually goes to bed with her and tries to help her in other ways this is not a bad film but it is certainly nothing to go crazy about unless you like a film location in canada and a good looking catherine mary stewart a native from canada
<START> so the weak excuse for a story in the generic waste of time involves a guy that wants to be an animator but can't get his career of the ground his super hot wife is more successful and she doesn't seem to care that he's a loser but the man isn't satisfied with that and wants to make more out of his life one day their dog brings them a magic mask that changes his life unfortunately for him the god <UNK> is looking for his magic mask and once he finds the man with the mask he tries to get it back and that's the whole story if that sounded exciting to you then someone needs to throw some water on you to wake you up br br this movie is terrible there's really no other way for me to say it and i just can't stretch it enough the only good thing about the whole thing was the woman that played jamie <UNK> wife who was hot but apart from her there's is nothing about this movie that is worth watching i know it's meant for kids and that's why it's so idiotic but what about the adults that have to take their kids to watch this trash why do we have to suffer through this vile vomit sack of horrid crap the original mask was a very good movie that had a great mix of comedy and great story telling this one is a lame attempt by hack filmmakers to cash in on the franchise and judging by the laughable bo gross i'm guessing the franchise won't go on any longer br br the cinematographer needs to be beaten severely because the <UNK> colors of the movie will make you feel like throwing up if there was music i didn't pay attention to it because i had already <UNK> my <UNK> to prevent myself from hearing the horrid dialog then there's the acting or at least what passes for acting nowadays you could watch an <UNK> and see much better acting in that than the one in this movie but i can't really blame the actors since it's the director who deserves the blame for apparently not realizing that the actors needed to do another f king take if new line is looking to start a franchise with this then they need to up their game by hiring writers that can actually write and stop thinking that the audience will watch any crap that comes out br br bottom line if you're a <UNK> and you love torturing yourself then please by all means check this out because it is painful to watch but if you're not and you actually like to watch movies that are good then avoid at all cost
<START> while john garfield seems to get the bulk of attention the true star of four daughters is <UNK> lane her performance is the <UNK> that holds the large cast together br br her ability to interact equally well with john garfield and the more <UNK> jeffrey <UNK> is at the core of the success of four daughters
<START> i'm in a film class and i know that i don't know everything about film but <UNK> this is one of the worst stupidest retarded and waste time movies that i have ever seen and i saw <UNK> they are both equally terrible is boring and nothing interesting even happens in the film its not really a heart warming story and pat <UNK> <UNK> nothing i'm not saying there should be fighting and crap blowing up but it would <UNK> up this more than bland film the kids they fond to act in this film may have been the real kids from island they sounded stupid and couldn't act as as far as i am concerned this was a stupid idea for a book and an even worse idea for a movie i don't know why this movie was even made top five worst movies of all time
<START> this is a true gem of a tv film based on a completely untrue story it follows the course of the down and out football league club through their course in the english <UNK> cup where mayhem ensues and the players all sport seventies styles the ending is unexpected the performances are great and nick <UNK> shows that he can do something other than host sports shows my only regret is that i didn't tape it
<START> i had been waiting eagerly to see this movie but when i finally got the chance i was very disappointed i had to stop half way or was it quarter way because of the poor script and directing not to mention the poor cast josh <UNK> is the only one who can act and he's much more suitable to be the hero of the story br br well basically the story is just about a loose girl from the country who cheated on her long time decent boyfriend only to have meaningless sex with a spoiled rich brat this movie failed to draw my sympathy not even when the writer intended to i wonder where the moral values go br br the actors are so stiff that when i resume the movie few weeks after it was interrupted due to its boring nature they still failed to make me pay attention the spoiled couple can only disgust me what a movie br br i think all the people involved in this production need to sit down and review it together so that they won't make the same mistakes next time round and next time they might consider josh <UNK> as the protagonist
<START> the movie opens with beautiful landscape shots of the <UNK> countryside <UNK> out from earth a <UNK> train crossing fields of <UNK> in the distance <UNK> of clouds small <UNK> by the side of the road a motel or a diner in the middle of nowhere over this plays a <UNK> but mysterious twin peaks piano <UNK> and it's all adequately moody and atmospheric in an american gothic sort of way through this however director jon <UNK> keeps awkward frames <UNK> of letters opening credits with annoying sounds color frames that <UNK> blue numbers that count towards the 12 steps to a conclusion announced in the opening credits it's obvious by the first couple of minutes that though <UNK> is more than capable to capture landscape and ambiance he doesn't care for it he has neither the affection for pacific <UNK> open <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> does in <UNK> and neither the time or <UNK> of twin peaks david lynch to <UNK> mystery and intrigue around a given location br br the rest of the movie is more jon <UNK> frustration with experimental tricks that serve their own purpose the use of split screen is interesting i like in particular how we get the first image of ricky lee split in two one is <UNK> childhood memories that matter only to him the other is <UNK> and <UNK> his head against the wall and over the course of the movie the second ricky lee <UNK> the macho laid back <UNK> with the shades who is hopelessly self involved and stupid on the other hand the stop motion animation and choice to play most of the movie in voice over narration does not work it does at times because <UNK> writes as good as he shoots static shots of the <UNK> american <UNK> but beth <UNK> monologues delivered in the most flat <UNK> <UNK> imaginable a voice that sounds like stephen <UNK> computer speech program crossed with a horse <UNK> are so grating to the ear it kind of <UNK> the purpose of trying to pay attention br br each of the couple relate to us their past experiences their small <UNK> and <UNK> and doubts and past relationships that went nowhere they say very little to each other and what they say they say with blank faces but they <UNK> like <UNK> that seems to be their only channel of communication left open perhaps the only one they can trust with any safety <UNK> clearly picks his main characters in among the naive and <UNK> those <UNK> by an american dream turned sour but he doesn't place himself above them he's not condescending or smug in his portrayal they may be misguided but they are <UNK> with moments of humanity awkward though they may be we're called to empathize and show affection rather than point and laugh this is the most successful becomes the movie's characters come alive even when their <UNK> faces do not even when <UNK> gets in their way with his stilted framing and <UNK> camera games br br then we go back to angry <UNK> about the destructive effects of money played over an inserted shot of a dollar bill we get a weird psychedelic sequence where camera <UNK> under big <UNK> trees that soon turn red as beth ann repeatedly <UNK> about the <UNK> trees in the voice over we even get a sudden about turn towards plot and genre as the couple of beth ann and ricky lee <UNK> losers with nowhere to go and nothing to hold them back to their dead end lives arrive in california and decide to rob a 7 11 the movie doesn't <UNK> to an emotional <UNK> in the aftermath of the <UNK> 7 11 job such as one might expect from a on the <UNK> road movie it slowly <UNK> to a halt and you look out the window to see it hasn't really got <UNK> in particular parts of the ride have been hypnotic and parts almost touching and funny but everything else has been mostly annoying
<START> i too saw this film at a film festival but unlike the previous poster i found it both interesting and original in a sea of terrible features shorts are often twice as bad do to small budgets and poor acting a w o l however is a taut little thriller that <UNK> back to the outer limits the performances are solid not that one would expect otherwise from morse or <UNK> and the directing is sharp and on the money i personally find it difficult to <UNK> the previous <UNK> comments with the film i saw a w o l is quite <UNK> written by <UNK> black who as is usually the case plays with the genre both paying homage to the stories pulp sensibilities while simultaneously <UNK> at the audience and never taking itself too seriously all in all a w o l proves to be an extremely well executed and fun film
<START> mr uwe fail strikes again transformed a classic game in a cheap piece of crap poor acting poor directing awful adaptation i mean far cry game was awesome its like a true <UNK> game cool weapons and lots lots lots of point and shoot in the movie we had nothing compared to the game well we had some of the point and shoot thing but i don't know how to explain but if you ever watched another uwe fail movie you will understand if you don't believe me go to the website <UNK> online and do a check for one named stop uwe bowl br br that movie made my eyes bleed someone must stop him for once br br don't waste your time
<START> um okay this is very poor indeed if compared to the first film the very much so <UNK> acclaimed rosemary's baby in fact it's a pretty poor film in general yes there are a few redeeming qualities but i'll get to that later br br well it has been quite a while since the last film took place in fact it's been pretty much eight years i believe <UNK> is still trying to escape with her child and influence him in a good way rather than let him <UNK> to the evil future that the <UNK> or tribe as it is referred to as here has laid out for him when she runs off with him and an empty bus comes and picks her up leaving her child with a hooker the hooker raises him until he comes of age where satan tries to possess him since he seems to be <UNK> his evil <UNK> in every way br br obviously things don't go as planned and then there is the ending that i would have felt seriously ashamed at had i not seen it coming since hearing that there was a sequel to rosemary's baby okay when i was around 11 years old i witnessed the masterpiece rosemary's baby and then read the book sequel thinking that this film was an adaptation of that i <UNK> this film down and got it was i right in doing so well in some way yes i am a true fan of this franchise and can say that i have seen the sequel and i have some idea as to what happens after the events in the first film speaking of both this film and son of <UNK> ira <UNK> own book sequel not yet adapted to film br br ruth gordon who played <UNK> in the first film is shown a few times in this film but why oh why is the <UNK> so different the knife <UNK> had dropped in the first film is shown sticking out of the ground yet <UNK> pulled it out the <UNK> is now called the tribe as i said earlier they now go around in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> satan <UNK> adrian <UNK> satan <UNK> adrian and so on and so forth the gothic building is now like a two story house on a lawn in the middle of nowhere it looks like a little nice <UNK> home or something and the child itself is pretty normal looking with his eyes only going all <UNK> when he gets mad and kills someone or something in that vain br br as far as the acting goes it's pretty poor on all parts except for stephen <UNK> whom plays a very grown up adrian duke <UNK> replacing <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> has to have one of the flat out worst performances ever to be caught on film it is so bad it's almost not even funny when she screams oh my god and cries for like the <UNK> time in the movie you're just like okay it's not funny anymore and then by the time she is gone and the movie has been on for twenty minutes only you're like thank the lord i don't have to hear her say oh my god any longer <UNK> in the end this movie has very very very few redeeming qualities enough to get it at least four stars but if you look at it as a serious sequel to the first film it's pretty much non existent
<START> one of the few comedic twilight <UNK> that's actually really good we have <UNK> the <UNK> from andy griffith show the stock in trade old <UNK> dude from many old westerns and lovable old it also has that cool <UNK> interior that i believe was used in the sci fi classic forbidden planet or else the day the earth stood <UNK> plus the new guys in town are driving an exotic <UNK> i think sports car back in the days when european <UNK> were known as foreign jobs in the u s the whole idea of <UNK> as weapon is a hoot and the fact that buddies love him despite being the fact he's a total <UNK> artist is a heartwarming moment
<START> you have got to see this movie i saw it as a 13 year old at the theater on my very first date fast forward over 20 years and i'm now gay thanks a lot one dark night lol this movie <UNK> the hell out of me as a kid still do but as an adult the thrill of this movie isn't in the storyline but rather the hysterical laughs it holds highlights are listening to the names the teenagers call each other from my personal favorite to turkey also keep your eyes <UNK> for the scene where carol the blond head sister attempts to hang her phone up on a <UNK> can can't believe they didn't that other highlights include adam <UNK> overly dramatic <UNK> and the <UNK> corpses if you're a fan of true horror i'd suggest this film just because to me it's almost a parody on horror there is <UNK> a creepy factor and the plot is a good one but don't watch it if you want to be scared out of your wits unless you're like 10 years old or something
<START> this was a very disappointing movie i would definitely call this the worst movie of all time br br the acting and writing were poor and the jokes were not funny br br i don't see why on earth this piece of crap was even made i'm not a <UNK> person and i can enjoy stupid things but this is just way too stupid and just plain awful br br avoid this wretched piece of garbage at all costs
<START> this is a difficult movie to watch and would have been even more difficult had i known then that the actor playing the protagonist was in fact killed in his home by police at age 19 <UNK> is a street kid in <UNK> <UNK> who is caught in a <UNK> <UNK> by a murder in which he had no involvement he is committed to a juvenile prison where he witnesses brutality and exploitation that ordinary citizens try very hard to believe doesn't exist when finally he escapes he and three <UNK> survive by the only means they know which is crime what makes the film so heart <UNK> is that both <UNK> and the actor portraying him clearly do not wish to be the characters life circumstances have made them <UNK> tries to trust and to love and to bond but there simply is no room in his world for the gentle side of human nature one is left at the end wanting desperately to do something for the of the world but what building more <UNK> with higher walls surely is not the answer
<START> cool action yeah the premise has been done but not this way that's the trick hey folks shock it's an x file br br to me it's cool that <UNK> <UNK> have almost no scenes together they have to adapt rely on each other's <UNK> sense about what's really going on and each other's adaptation skills they read into each other's moves and get the job done sort of br br oh yeah really good acting do these people get paid to do this or a slow day when the <UNK> store doesn't call them into work hey duchovny where's the day old <UNK> malcolm get to school
<START> i liked some of the characters but our lead relied too heavily on a charming smile i didn't care two about him he makes bad choices and i really didn't care since he did not seem to either he seemed rather <UNK> there were a couple of moments that provided a chance at some human insight the scene with the whale was interesting but these are lost in the general <UNK> of the film the love interest was acceptable and the other various characters were mildly interesting but the plot <UNK> around too much and left me wanting at many points in the film in the end i wondered why i stayed so long br br there are some <UNK> humorous moments but ultimately i did not care i cannot <UNK> rating the film higher 3 of 10
<START> is this supposed to be serious i hope not this is one of the most <UNK> hilarious movies i've ever seen given that i picked it up for a buck on the bad movies shelf it sure lives up to its spot in the shop what can i say the gore effects are <UNK> pun intended all over the place some looking quite real some looking like a teddy bear that's had an accident with a bottle of <UNK> <UNK> the music is some of the most horrible i've heard the acting is one of the most amusing elements must i continue don't bother unless you've seen every other pathetic horror movie in the shop and this is all that's left
<START> this movie isn't that great at all but it's good when you want to just laugh because it's pretty ridiculous there are a lot of mistakes in it and it's cheesy i got this movie for christmas like 5 years ago but for some reason i've never given it away i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year this is a very 90's movie so it's really funny to see how everyone dresses and acts this movie is good for someone young although come to think of it i didn't even like it much when i was like 12 but that's just my personal opinion the movie was really predictable i wish it had had some extra weird twists but i guess it was trying to be an appropriate movie for everyone to enjoy i think it was appropriate for the whole family but dress was a bit but certainly appropriate enough for family material
<START> it's hard to use words for this movie since it contains none itself br br but the images it conveys both powerful and sweeping are ones which remind us why we watch movies and you might be saying well leonard <UNK> doesn't like it it can't be that good but you're wrong see this movie french cinematic brilliance en ensemble
<START> i really like kinski he is a great actor i've seen this movie because i've heard that there are <UNK> aspects in this movie br br the film is full of symbols like a piano sinking in a river or strange shadow pictures at the walls then the narrator always says abstract sentences like a kid sells fortune but her box is empty now this is really disturbing and wasn't really necessary because everyone understands what this movie is all about the movie shows how <UNK> character treated woman and how he kept them under control if there are really some aspects of <UNK> life in this story then he really was an <UNK> so there is no need to watch this movie unless if you want to see kinski naked or if you like sick trash movies to laugh about
<START> i'll make this brief this was a joy to watch it may or may not have been more effective if the characters had <UNK> their real life counterparts but aside from this minor observation i found the fantasy animal characters to be most enjoyable the visuals were most stunning except for the second rate cg scenes which could have been left out i dislike computer generated animation anyways it <UNK> the purpose of a biopic such as this one watch it you will appreciate it too
<START> ya know i have no idea how everybody else's teenage life was but this does not reflect the folks i knew and hung around with let alone myself and just in case if you're wondering no we weren't <UNK> clean cut pat <UNK> type teens if there was ever such a thing br br look i'm not saying being a teenager is easy the better well actually the best teen movie of this time is fast times at <UNK> high now those kids i knew and were as realistic as it got back then and maybe now br br this was crap this was a low rent version of fast times and even then it didn't do much for me it had a few moments but not enough for me to recommend this or even claim this is how it was for teens back in 1982 i couldn't relate the lead girl girls did nothing for me and please if they really wanted to keep their virginity they would have in which case this film would not have been made pure crap and a bad <UNK> to be left behind as a time capsule cinema for teens young adults in the early <UNK>
<START> this movie is <UNK> bad that it forced me to create an account with imdb just to warn others about it br br i have been using imdb for a long time and many movies have come close to making me want to register to either praise or bash them however none have ever been that worthy until now br br i am a huge matt dillon fan all i could ask myself throughout this movie is how did dillon choose this script really i mean there are holes in it larger than br br i mean it is a modern day heist movie not one set in the seventies for crying out loud even a child knows that <UNK> <UNK> have <UNK> tracking and the sort makes you wonder what it takes to get a script produced in hollywood br br i could go on for ages but i wont believe me when i say this save yourself the time and give this a skip br br sorry matt i'm still a fan but this movie sucked
<START> everything about this movie is perfect the set design the acting the camera movement the mood the colors everything you'll be hard pressed to find a better movie easily the best film generated in the last 35 years keep an eye on michael
<START> this movie is a great movie however it is as most movie highly predictable the greatest highlight of the movie of course is the star character amanda <UNK> who is absolutely gorgeous and hilarious she is one of very few people in this world who can use all <UNK> <UNK> in her face to make the most strangest and gut <UNK> faces ever made it's good for the kids and contains upper male nudity and suggestive nudity towards the end all in all they did a good job <UNK> an old classic and deserves to rest on the movie stand along with o and 10 things i hate about you the other actors also do a <UNK> job in many of their first time <UNK>
<START> i remember flipping through channels on hbo and saw this this my friends is one of the worst tv movies i've ever seen there is no excitement in this film br br the story starts out with drew <UNK> <UNK> cameron <UNK> driving to a small town while in a <UNK> she stays with a couple who <UNK> had a daughter named laura who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress even the <UNK> agree that they looked alike thing is laura was killed over a year ago her boyfriend went missing around the same time she was murdered making it look like he had killed her br br while <UNK> in this town for a while drew starts to have visions and nightmares these visions and nightmares might prove that the boyfriend of laura isn't the killer after all throughout the film you find out that ray sr denis is the one that raped her frequently over a period of time and killed her br br the movie is too long and very boring the film just drags on and on and on and on amazingly i saw another tv movie after this called <UNK> 1997 which was good but i'll review that one later br br i give this movie 1 star out of 10 avoid this tv movie it is not worth your time this is the worst tv movie of 1997
<START> ex reporter <UNK> eric roberts is hired by an <UNK> raymond j barry to find his ex wife and son heads to palm springs and quickly <UNK> the ex <UNK> beverly <UNK> with someone he believes to be the son a young johnny <UNK> but things turn out to be a bit more complicated as discovers former white trash <UNK> has definitely married up in the form of millionaire simon <UNK> dan <UNK> and her first son is nowhere to be seen br br director writer matthew <UNK> is <UNK> body heat here and this mid 80s neo noir is watchable enough thanks to an all star cast and nice locations <UNK> was still looking good around this time so she makes for a good femme fatale and isn't afraid to show some skin however the mystery isn't very compelling in the end co starring dennis emily and henry gibson <UNK> made several thrillers in the 80s but his biggest career achievement was co <UNK> the screenplay for the infamous color of night
<START> there are lot of similarities between never say never again and <UNK> not only on sean connery but also the story and plot except the actors all other are same like <UNK> atomic bombs asking for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a ship etc only difference are place of <UNK> in thunder ball plot it is in <UNK> in never say never again it is over north africa and in thunder ball the <UNK> <UNK> itself loads the <UNK> into plane and in never say never again it is changed by an <UNK> arm of the axe and air dropped over us and stolen in <UNK> almost 99 is same if anybody wants to <UNK> this they are most welcome
<START> i l o v e this movie everyone and their <UNK> sister's <UNK> dentist needs to own it its witty <UNK> thrilling comedic and full of action packed goodness with this movie those amazing people at troma offer you a whole new perspective into the story of romeo and juliet in ways you never would have thought to be possible it has all the <UNK> of an instant classic car crashes deliciously <UNK> sex scenes <UNK> families street fights amazing music severed heads and from <UNK> the story line and thats only a taste of what it has to offer every single person i have watched this movie with now owns their own copy or <UNK> to a and
<START> an absolutely <UNK> western featuring flash forward sequences set in an insane asylum south of hell mountain was one of the first films produced by the at cannon film co directed by william <UNK> who would later deliver such fan favourites as the incredible melting man and <UNK> the film tells the very dull tale of a trio of gold robbers who stumble upon a cabin occupied by two women who are hiding some secrets that aren't worth discovering the cast most of whom never made another film try <UNK> but are <UNK> by the screenplay which generally makes no sense the asylum scenes are edited in to little effect and are <UNK> by ridiculous sound effects and tape <UNK> ultimately it's a lot of talk and little else
<START> okay anyone looking to see a great work of art should not watch this film a sophisticated film <UNK> will no doubt be <UNK> by the horrid production values and the sight of watching an excellent actor joseph <UNK> <UNK> himself out for a buck mr <UNK> must have either really needed the money or he was too <UNK> to realize that the film was crap the same phenomenon occurred with dana andrews who late in his career appeared in the campy and awful frozen dead i know mr andrews was in the <UNK> of alcoholism but why did <UNK> do this mess br br as for the plot it's a <UNK> of the frankenstein plot the first half of the movie really looked as if they were doing a serious but seriously flawed version of the original frankenstein story then inexplicably they introduced a daughter this wasn't a bad thing until then out of the blue they decided to stop making a horror film but make a soft core pornographic flick the change was dramatic and bizarre it was almost as if they said okay mr <UNK> is done with his scenes and has gone home now ladies strip br br the problem is that on every level the film is just awful except for the <UNK> makeup while not great it is still pretty cool to see but bad writing acting and a budget of 17 <UNK> <UNK> to make this a drab and awful flick one so bad that <UNK> in some nudity for the <UNK> out there shouldn't be enough to <UNK> anyone to see it
<START> i had never heard about this film prior to coming across it as i was <UNK> the shelves at a local rental store having just watched the latest harry potter installment i was intrigued by rupert and wanted to see more of his work reading the description on back about an <UNK> <UNK> christian do <UNK> and <UNK> as an <UNK> christian myself i thought should be interesting and so it was i found mr <UNK> story beautiful in both words and images and sadly enough all too familiar the contrast he drew between ben's <UNK> interpretations of what it means to be a christian was a poignant commentary on how christians view themselves and the impact that perception has on those around them on the one hand we have ben's mom stating whatever happens behind these walls ben we're god's <UNK> we show the world a smiling face on the other hand is ben's dad discussing truth in his <UNK> at the beginning of the film at the end of his monologue he states the more a person <UNK> their christianity for the benefit of others the less i am inclined to trust the christianity they claim god tells us true faith is the freedom to choose truth now how you express that the way the manner the means at your <UNK> these things are of no consequence be you christian or <UNK> unless in your heart you are true if only our <UNK> were full of christians who to this latter definition of what it means to be a <UNK> of jesus rather than the former what a difference that would make as a christian and a psychologist i would want an <UNK> yet authentic faith over a perfectly polished image any day what a tragedy ¬ñ to feel like i always need to play a role when really i just need to rest in the freedom of being completely who god made me to be i think mr <UNK> provides a refreshing glimpse of what this freedom in christ looks like i recommend this film for anyone who desires a fresh look at faith
<START> this was a nice film it had a interesting storyline that was executed pretty well in the later part of the film the storyline kinda reminded me of the city of god but this one is done in a more <UNK> way in comparison it had what i really loved a <UNK> of <UNK> some pretty interesting cinematography thru the wooden camera i'm not sure if it was <UNK> correct but it definitely <UNK> you're view of south africa the actors were good for 1st <UNK> most of them anyway i especially liked <UNK> character which made this movie pretty enjoyable what is interesting though was that it makes you ask about your own life are you really doing what you really love or do you <UNK> to the norm the around you definitely worth a watch
<START> i went to see this movie to kill some time i remember cole <UNK> in <UNK> and although his acting is wooden he does portray a tough leader character same here this movie was about a bunch of young hot scientists and <UNK> exploring a cave in romania that one has to dive to see the beginning scene was very interesting with a bunch of romanian or russian men exploring the cave in search of <UNK> flash forward 30 years and we have a team of <UNK> called in by some scientist and his crew to explore some cave for some unknown scientific purpose br br there is a lot of clich√©d useless talk the women are too hot for their jobs let's face it i hate to watch the lips of these women talk about the guys while drinking beer at the pre cave exploration party i mean it was like we were at some bar with frat and <UNK> types talking about the opposite sex not a group of scientists and <UNK> every character had zero personality with perhaps exception of the scientist who at least wasn't one of the young and beautiful people so the acting although <UNK> was not inspiring br br the dialog was pretty bad at one point in the movie cole <UNK> jack the lead diver his <UNK> <UNK> into the <UNK> symbol and stay like that we are led to believe that since he was <UNK> by one of these monsters that he is turning into one of them fair enough but first of all nobody says the obvious thing to him what is up with your eyes dude no everybody just talked about how he's changed and that he should not be the leader of the group anymore and then this guy says you see how he's not human huh if they really believed he was a <UNK> monster then why not act like it instead the group <UNK> in two those who go with jack and those who go their separate ways i guess thinking him to be a monster it makes no sense br br the best scene in the movie was this blonde diver woman <UNK> up a cave wall and gets attacked by this <UNK> her scream really sucked but she fought like hell to <UNK> the <UNK> br br the photography was fine when the camera was still but any action sequences the director found it useful to confuse the hell out of us by flashing <UNK> <UNK> dark space god knows what i wish they would just show us a scene straight once in awhile just because you move the camera all over the place doesn't make the movie any scarier folks br br this movie could have been a lot better if the following changes had been made br br 1 every actor was replaced by someone who looked real let cole <UNK> be the lead it's ok to let him be the good looking one i'm getting tired of seeing 20 something <UNK> scientists give me a break people br br 2 the cinematographer was fired and replaced by one who just pointed the camera and sat still this could be the director's fault i don't know <UNK> camera as in constant <UNK> is getting old folks br br 3 we got to see the <UNK> actually <UNK> the people how bout some gore there's not much else in this movie we barely got to see the creatures i felt a little ripped off about that br br 4 the ending was pretty lame during the denouement the sexy british scientist has a secret guess what that is it's a bit <UNK> the ending would have been better if they all died instead of the black guy morris <UNK> who seemed to breathe a little sympathy into his character just by his worried expressions all the other actors had no expression br br i gave it a 4 out of 10 because after all the acting was without noticeable errors and the concept was fairly original i'd like to see cole do more military roles he's good at it
<START> i have to admit i had never heard of this movie i caught it last night on <UNK> i thought it was hysterical i laughed so hard and loved the ending image what a marx brothers movie would like if they <UNK> with <UNK> and x and then all dropped <UNK> br br funny and edgy are two <UNK> words these days this movie sure has that plus about 200 iq points of most comedies today and <UNK> to boot i had to be up at 6 00 am and watched it until 2 30 i over slept and missed my <UNK> still worth it i would not recommend renting it i would recommend <UNK> it it was that good br br the only warning i have is that so of the references are dated and might not be gotten by younger people bare with it and use your head br br i would have to put it in my top comedies of all time
<START> i hadn't planned on leaving a review but seeing some of the other dreadful reviews for this movie i had to say something br br i'm not going to give away the ending or anything but i do give away some important plot points in this review so you should be aware of that the short non spoiler version of my review samuel l jackson and <UNK> davis both kick butt in this movie and it's a lot of fun watch it br br this movie is one of my favorites of all time <UNK> davis is perfect as the action heroine torn between her existing life as a housewife and mother and the memories that are <UNK> of her former life as a cia assassin her performance is superb as she plays both <UNK> of this relatively complex character perfectly br br samuel l jackson's performance is as always also excellent as the private investigator that <UNK> <UNK> character hired to look into her forgotten past he does a great job of playing the <UNK> sidekick to <UNK> <UNK> tough character some of the lines he <UNK> in this movie are the best he's ever used in any movie he's been in br br seriously if you haven't seen it do it's a fantastic story with lots of unexpected twists and turns and it's extremely well directed and acted
<START> <UNK> an army training camp comedy starring bill murray and directed by <UNK> <UNK> is a favourite of mine <UNK> a summer camp <UNK> starring bill murray and directed by <UNK> <UNK> is a complete waste of time it takes a considerable effort for four screenwriters to produce a movie the word <UNK> a work with <UNK> as witless <UNK> and boring as this br br murray evidently reached the same conclusion during filming but his usually reliable powers of <UNK> escape him and his <UNK> attempts to <UNK> life into proceedings just add to the embarrassment the it really doesn't matter <UNK> scene is excruciating it doesn't help that the supporting cast is <UNK> of talent the funniest thing about them is their hair but then <UNK> was made in 1979 and introducing chris <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> the opening credits no not the chris <UNK> br br mercifully <UNK> <UNK> his mistake two years later for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is so much funnier when he's <UNK> around with the likes of john candy warren <UNK> and john <UNK> <UNK> this and watch that
<START> this is a masterpiece 'the big is a crazy weird hilarious and eventually touching look at an old married couple and their quiet life who argue over <UNK> and <UNK> while a nuclear war <UNK> on outside everything in this great animated short stands out as memorable the eye shaking of the wife the <UNK> the husband's saw fetish keep an eye on those backgrounds the very verbal cat the demented game show the informative news anchor the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> and the moving and memorable ending i am so glad i found 'the big which is hands down one of the greatest works of film ever produced
<START> again such kind of zero budget digital video <UNK> trash and again i fell into this trap <UNK> the title had zombie in it german title zombie attack the story on halloween some people visit the museum of the dead it's a trap a crazy doctor wants to kill the people everything connected to some aztec cult so they fight against some zombies in there br br ultra cheap scenery some corridors with black tape on it a few <UNK> drawings and a few <UNK> as you can find them in every fun shop no actors just low grade models waking around with absolutely no idea what to do no effects laughable make up your local <UNK> make up zombie fan will do it better some time it looked as if they had not enough money for enough colour otherwise they just could not do it like this man they have to realize the looks of their zombies some laughable martial arts fights with the zombies slow motion just when the director wants to have it scary he uses some standard digital video <UNK> effect where everything is unbelievable 0 out of 10
<START> family guy has to be my all time favorite cartoon it is definitely the funniest tv show ever made and is better than the simpsons i have never laughed so hard at a tv show in my life the things that make the show so funny is the plot characters and themes that are dealt with in the show there are very few themes that have not been dealt with on family guy br br i have seen just about every episode of family guy ever made and would have to say that the show was better in the first two seasons my favorite characters are peter because he is very funny and is the best character of the show my second favorite character is because he is the funniest villain to be on a tv show if you love family you should check out american dad because it is just so similar and is created by seth <UNK> i hope this show never ends because it is a comic genius 10 10
<START> <UNK> is i think a very <UNK> <UNK> film the plot was <UNK> with symbolism ie the white and red <UNK> and plot twists which wrapped themselves up neatly the look was very <UNK> and pulled you closer to the story i saw it in london and very much regret that it is not out on video in the states
<START> i saw house party 1 3 and i loved them but this one wasn't funny at all first it can't be a house party movie without kid right this one sucks and it was more like a black version of <UNK> <UNK> day off than a house party movie second who the heck is john john these new character's can't even compare to the ones from the other three movies now i know why they put it straight to video it has horrible music weak plot <UNK> actors and no hilarious jokes at all my advice watch this movie at night only if you can't get to sleep they should have ended the series after house party 3 since separated after that one i hate this one am glad my local video store doesn't have this film and never want to buy it or want to see it on comedy central either just because chris <UNK> has talent managing an up and coming r b group doesn't mean he has talent directing and producing films am i right or what finally the female characters were all dressed up like cheap two dollar <UNK> throughout most of the flick separated a year after this flick got released probably due to the failure of this film and are all but forgotten nowadays in terms this movie just plain old sucks
<START> i'm a <UNK> fan but this is arguably his least successful film comedy has never been his strong suit and here his attempts at screwball farce are clumsily done still it's almost worth seeing for <UNK> eye for talent this is one of uma <UNK> first starring roles and as always she is ravishing to watch on a sad side note <UNK> wrote the script with his daughter who died a couple years ago
<START> mild spoiler in the second paragraph br br anna christie was <UNK> lackluster 1st <UNK> she and <UNK> look like the only people who know what they're doing in this movie the old guy who plays <UNK> dad george f marion in the film is <UNK> ah all he does is stumble around <UNK> in a totally fake way and yell about <UNK> old <UNK> sea he blames <UNK> past his whole life and everything on the sea he comes across as stupid x 10 charles <UNK> is matt the rough <UNK> <UNK> sailor garbo falls in love with and he's fine in his role but nothing really outstanding br br the best part is when garbo <UNK> her terrible secret on <UNK> and her dad finally marion stops talking about the evil of the sea and beats his head and <UNK> on the table in perfect time with <UNK> then soon he goes on a <UNK> about the sea br br i had to practically force myself to finish anna christie it's too melodramatic in many parts and <UNK> there are many good early <UNK> but this is not one of them if you haven't seen garbo before try something else before anna christie like <UNK> or grand hotel
<START> starring <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> ¬ñ <UNK> is a low budget drama set in a latino neighborhood in nyc br br a young comic book artist <UNK> <UNK> wants to escape his latino neighborhood when his father is crippled by a <UNK> <UNK> the young man is forced to run the family <UNK> br br the movie was shot in a budget low resolution video and poor audio with low profile actors br br the plot <UNK> well for 85 minutes but the last 5 minutes were just terrible we don't know for sure if <UNK> and his girlfriend remained together and if angel ended up in jail for the shooting br br 4 10
<START> i think this is one of those few movies that i want to rate it as low as possible just to pay it a compliment br br i haven't seen this movie in about 25 years so i really can't say that much about it it still seems to be very hard to find on video but i remember my brother and i stumbled upon it somewhere in the toxic <UNK> of late night <UNK> channel television of the mid 1980s when i was about 10 years old so i've never actually seen the beginning of the movie but i saw most of it the first thing i remember is this couple is <UNK> out of a <UNK> and they're <UNK> to an island to make out and then they get attacked by an insane <UNK> in a <UNK> with an axe they manage to escape from him but get attacked by the <UNK> <UNK> monster which in this movie is just a head and a neck with no body the eyes and the mouth of the monster don't even move it looks like a br br i mean i had just literally never seen anything on this <UNK> before and it totally blew my mind i had seen some bad movies on tv in the early 80s but i had never seen something so totally inept and so casually and <UNK> constructed that it seemed like the people who made it spent less time and effort on it than we did watching it i had already seen some of the troma films and that type of thing that tries to deliberately be campy but this was the pure and real stuff and it was my first encounter with truly great bad film making this movie was like the last gasp of the drive in era and i caught a <UNK> of it just in time actually when we were watching it we couldn't figure out if it was made in the 50s or the 70s turns out it came out just a few years before i saw it br br later i came into contact with mystery science theater and found out about a lot of the old b movies and serials but i had already seen it in this movie the movie is so funny that i had never even laughed that hard at the monty python crew or bill murray or any comedian after seeing this movie i was always trying to search for the good bad movies and i got a lot of my friends into it but this movie was and basically is an impossible one to find i never really found out what it even was or who larry <UNK> was until the 1990s when imdb took off and the internet took off and information started getting passed around but this movie still needs to be discovered by a lot of others who might appreciate its bad qualities look for it
<START> me being from australia and loving the series i wasn't expecting much from the american version of and kim but i thought i'd watch the first episode to see if it was really that bad br br well whats there to say its nothing special <UNK> blair is ok as kim and actually had a few good lines molly shannon is not a good though the good thing about jane <UNK> is that when she speaks with all her funny accents such as when she says or it sounds like its just the natural way that she speaks but when shannon has a go at the accent its clear that she is acting and trying to be the same as turner and the show really misses sharon or some one else to give us something to laugh about because the <UNK> and craig characters in this version are really not funny br br so far only the first episode has aired and it is clearly not up to the standards of the aussie version although if it was a stand alone television show with a different name not being compared to the aussie version it would perhaps be viewed as being a little bit better but if there is nothing else to do on a sunday night or <UNK> night in america then you cant do much harm in watching it or better put on some of the aussie version if you've got it
<START> the plot four people are caught in an elevator one is a business man the annoying kind who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone and is a walking talking <UNK> of <UNK> stress and <UNK> then there's his colleague a woman who is much more pleasant in her character a teenage rebel who just broke into a coke machine and by his mere presence drives the businessman mad and an older guy who just stole 100 make up the rest of the cast br br the movie is all about how they cope with their problem as time goes on and on without any success in reaching the outside world as the lights go out and as the <UNK> begin to snap one after the other br br and yet it isn't too exciting the characters are stereotypes the story is stupid and unlikely how could so many things go so wrong in just one elevator you don't like the characters very much you just hate one of them and all the twists and turns in the plot are not <UNK> to the excitement they are just stupid excuses for filling yet another few minutes with dialogue as the screenwriters keep running out of inspiration and <UNK> on a full length movie set in an elevator br br let's just hope phone booth will be a better effort
<START> when i first saw race against fear don't you just love <UNK> movie titles i had to keep scratching my head was this meant to be serious why couldn't the main character even run like a normal person running much less like a star runner how did i know that the coach was evil only 1 minute into the film all of these questions and no answers then i just let the inane script and the awful directing just carry me away it was easier not to resist then the film became funnier by the minute and i now rank it among my top ten junk movies from <UNK> some have said here that <UNK> richards is really talented but that the material was flawed i <UNK> disagree not only can she not convince me that she's an <UNK> she's walks wide eyed through the rest of the story like she's just landed on earth maybe the coach broke out of prison and finished her off at least i hope so
<START> this movie has it all great actors good dialog drama comedy and excellent writing and directing by paul thomas anderson i have seen this film several times and enjoy it more each time it doesn't get old it is consistently entertaining and stimulating easily burt reynolds best role and he does a great job john c <UNK> and don cheadle also give excellent comedic performances there is not a weak element in this film
<START> i don't know how this film went <UNK> for so long br br i saw this film on tv i was flipping through the channels and came across this unexpectedly well made film i missed the first probably 10 minutes but that does not matter this film literally <UNK> me it is a real spine <UNK> br br the absence of well known actors in the film adds on to the effect u do not know what to expect from the actors because they are new u never know when they will get killed or what they are up to so it is all the more tense even though there are many new faces their performances were top class br br the filmmakers play with your mind just revealing enough gore to make imagine the rest the shock fear horror and <UNK> are also brought out well by characters in the film br br the well written situations n twists fast camera movements slick editing and superb direction makes it an excellent suspense thriller this film actually switches between the genres horror and suspense thriller leaving the viewer clueless and <UNK> undoubtedly comparable to hitchcock br br i could not even move from the tv even during the commercial breaks i was the helpless mute witness to this superb film
<START> this movie earns its 3 for lousy writing poor technical merit and continuity problems some people have given this movie a 10 and perhaps that is okay if you are simply <UNK> it for its fun factor however technically this is an inept movie serial from start to finish produced by 3rd rate writers actors and crew that really was true of nearly all the serials because they were meant as low brow entertainment particularly aimed at the kids and there's nothing wrong with that but high art it ain't spy earns a lower than average score compared to other serials because it is of even lower quality and has major continuity problems even for a serial it was common for a serial to have a cliff <UNK> i e a moment at the end of the episode that looked as if the good guy dies but miraculously survives when the next episode began but in this film it's much <UNK> and ridiculous you would literally see the hero die in the last episode but in the next they re shot the scene and showed he actually didn't die even though they clearly showed him buy the farm in the last one again and again in spy he seems to die but in the next episode they show it from a different angle and he somehow avoided death even if he fell <UNK> feet into a river fell into a buzz saw or whatever br br watch this movie not for its quality but either for a good laugh or to learn what it was like to go to the movies on saturday <UNK> decades ago
<START> it had potential it really did but there is so much about the movie that was ridiculous and laughable i'm a horror movie <UNK> and i thought it was stupid as did my 13 year old i was expecting to be at least <UNK> out and yes the gross factor of the <UNK> <UNK> in the people was there however the lead up to getting to the ruins is just dumb dumb dumb br br i mean really who goes on a <UNK> in a jungle with a total stranger with a little water and a few <UNK> in flip <UNK> no less <UNK> <UNK> better still who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without an <UNK> or being able to speak a bit of the language are these people complete morons br br the brother isn't heard from and he doesn't call for assistance who doesn't do that he just finds some <UNK> and americans to go on a little search and find
<START> the most amazing film i have ever seen i didn't read the programming and i just stumbled onto the movie by accident i thought it was a real documentary and i felt sick at what i saw i only found out it was a movie after it was finished and i looked on the web for more info about punishment park in the u s it felt incredibly real and it is easy to believe that this really has happened in the us if you are from europe i must admit that i felt really anti american after watching the movie and before finding out that it didn't really happen that way
<START> i watched the version with pathetic american over <UNK> maybe this made it much worse but from what i could make out the film was pretty bad anyway it seemed low budget the visuals reminded me of a second rate tv movie random white dog <UNK> for embarrassing 60's bbc costumes etc mainly though i feel like the characters in the movie did not behave anything like the characters in the comic and as a result i never felt willing to even try to forgive the poor look of the film it is always going to be hard to capture the feel of the comics in a film without using animation and i didn't feel this attempt was worth it ultimately
<START> i went to see <UNK> i would hate it i did everything about it was wrong it was like they were filming a different book granted the locations and houses very lovely if not a little miscast yes even the house were wrong for their parts <UNK> was too modern dull and frankly i found it unpleasant to watch her were everyone else sees <UNK> as a sex god the writer of this saw him as sexually frustrated and <UNK> was stupid and <UNK> he isn't meant to be and the <UNK> were shown to be <UNK> and for some unknown reason <UNK> this is incorrect and ludicrous the very idea that mr bennett would answer the door in his night gear with the rest of the family dressed in their underwear to in the middle of the night is stupid they had servants mr collins was not repulsive and <UNK> merely stupid and obnoxious <UNK> <UNK> was ugly and old and miss wore a <UNK> dress what as if it is historically inaccurate and even the ending is unsatisfying i could go on for days i hated it so much as not only was it nothing like the book but i fear that for many people it will be their fist experience of this great novel and it will give them the worst possible idea of it the bbc version is so superior it's not even funny and everything about this version is an insult to its memory in short if you must see it be sure you have read the book first or seen the bbc version other wise you will be lead done the <UNK> road that this is what it's like which its not
<START> the movie is about paul a young man who sinks into the harsh world of insanity and his stay at the mental hospital and his friends victor <UNK> who during his education in england started to think he was <UNK> hitler peter who took to much <UNK> and tried to fly of a roof top the fall left no broken bones or physical damage only insanity he is with china <UNK> has spent most time at the hospital although <UNK> is slightly older then him he claims he wrote every single beatles song and send it to them by <UNK> br br the novel is better then the movie and covers all of <UNK> life from birth to his death there is a long time since i saw the movie but if i remember it right the movie doesn't cover <UNK> childhood br br is funny sad and powerful if you haven't seen it watch it now and read the novel first it makes the movie better
<START> this is a silly movie with much singing and dancing acting is average but writing leaves something to be desired there are <UNK> performances by buddy with a short but outstanding performance by gypsy rose as the bitter wife of a rich playboy a totally unbelievable portrayal of college life which ends with a superb ice <UNK> of alice in wonderland many parts are worth watching but do not be afraid to fast forward through parts of the movie
<START> we all know what chan <UNK> park can do if you haven't seen <UNK> or the sympathy trilogy for that matter you are missing out on some of the best films made this century but i'm not here to talk about them i'm here to talk about <UNK> br br this movie is not what you would expect yes it is a vampire movie but at the same time it is also a very twisted tale of romance between a priest and a young girl i wont get into the synopsis you can read that above but instead tell you what this movie has to offer chan <UNK> park is a master of cinematography and this movie is no exception with some very surreal scenes backed by intense lighting he sets the mood perfectly in almost every scene the movie does start a bit slow but i felt this was necessary to build a relationship with the characters once things start moving along it almost never lets up until the credits roll <UNK> is <UNK> a love story but not in the same sense that you would think the relationship between the lead characters is very intense but at the same time almost disturbing chan <UNK> park is no stranger to controversy as we know and this film touches on taboo almost as much as <UNK> the end scene is by far the most powerful in the movie and perhaps one of the best conclusions to a film i have seen br br overall this is an exceptional film that i feel all movie buffs should see it is an exciting and admittedly different take on the world of vampires and the romance is far from sappy or boring this movie is gritty <UNK> and beautiful in all the wrong ways obviously it is not for everyone but chances are if you are reading this review you are already interested see it do not hesitate
<START> odd but wonderfully original movie genuinely frightening creepy and ridiculous in equal <UNK> the setting of a high rise red brick apartment is a perfect backdrop for the haunting action the thought of a secret sealed room in a place like this is good enough but when the lead naive couple start cleaning up the old bed they find in this room the scene is set for some classic chills the cast is fantastic <UNK> <UNK> really gets to chew some scenery after being <UNK> in other full moon films joe <UNK> proves why brother martin sheen is so much bigger in hollywood his rolling eyes during the making the bed scene are really hilarious charles band co produced with stuart gordon and this really is an exceptional full moon release danny also directed hell asylum with <UNK>
<START> this movie starts off somewhat slowly and gets running towards the end not that that is bad it was done to illustrate character <UNK> of the main character consequently if you are not into <UNK> this is not your movie it is the thought provoking philosophy of this movie that makes it worthwhile if you liked <UNK> <UNK> and punishment you will probably like this if only for the comparisons the intriguing question that the movie <UNK> is what is it that makes a renowned writer completely disregard his <UNK> ideas for another set the new ideas are quite opposed to the status <UNK> if you are a conservative you will not like this movie br br besides other philosophical questions i must admit that the movie was quite <UNK> pleasing as well the <UNK> and beautiful scenery helped me get past the slow start also there was use of symbolism in representing the of the main characters if these sorts of things do not impress you skip it overall i give this movie a 7
<START> <UNK> and juliet is perhaps the best shakespeare <UNK> i have ever seen not that there's much competition but anyway br br all in all <UNK> and juliet is definitely one of <UNK> better movies one of the little <UNK> hidden in a <UNK> heap of dung it's a funny action packed gory take on the world's greatest love story but still manages to follow the original story as <UNK> as one can except from this kind of movie well except for the ending where <UNK> and juliet kill abusive father and live happily together in a sunny suburban area for the rest of their lives with their <UNK> mutated children br br this is the movie high school literature classes should show instead of making poor students read through hundreds and hundreds of pages of shakespeare's scripts thumbs up
<START> this film is essentially for those who have had little or no introduction to hip hop specifically as was the case with the director before he started this film it was cool to have it focus on the bay more than expected because ny is always getting all the credit but from the bay the q bert worship is a little out of control this film didn't introduce anything new to me but it did change my opinion in that going into it i was <UNK> about the <UNK> of giving the tables the distinction of being a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this film ought to convince anyone that it's right up there with the <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> rising is a documentary about the <UNK> of <UNK> the <UNK> specifically the most violent one according to this film a lot more kids have died violently in <UNK> over the last decade or so than in israel <UNK> during the same period a fact astonishing if true which shows how under recognized this social problem is in the rest of the world this is an important topic especially for those who see hope in <UNK> efforts to <UNK> the and most at risk through a vibrant cultural program this is a compelling documentary if occasionally marred by a somewhat too personality based version of events and by grainy digital video and film that sometimes may make you think you need to have your eyes examined br br drug <UNK> rule in the <UNK> and gun <UNK> teenage boys are the main drug dealers like in parts of <UNK> <UNK> movie city of god de <UNK> has been accused of celebrating violence de <UNK> is another of many <UNK> but the early section of rising shows that in fact boys do celebrate violence and want to deal drugs where the money and the action are it's cool to carry a gun there cool to work as a drug <UNK> it's fifty times more <UNK> than the <UNK> available by other means br br first discovered the movement and its leaders anderson and <UNK> junior while visiting <UNK> for a <UNK> and quickly <UNK> his friend and mentor <UNK> to quit his job and come down to help make a film with his own promise to <UNK> it <UNK> and charisma and a startling twist in his life make him the center of the film and its chief narrator but like the <UNK> themselves the film <UNK> with other people no doubt about the fact that is a remarkable leader <UNK> and artist br br is compared to <UNK> shooting there was very dangerous anderson friendship and protection and caution and <UNK> in the shooting <UNK> the filmmakers to gain access and shoot detailed footage of their subject matters while mostly there were close calls avoiding any serious <UNK> with drug <UNK> or drug dealing cops they also trained boys to use cameras and left them there on <UNK> home that resulted in 10 of the footage including rare shots of violent incidents including police <UNK> it's hard for an <UNK> to keep track of police <UNK> in <UNK> there was one in the early 1990's that <UNK> over the story and inspired who ended his own early involvement in drug <UNK> to lead his cultural movement the cops are all over the drug trade and if anybody doesn't like that the ill trained police <UNK> come in often wearing black <UNK> masks and shoot up a neighborhood killing a lot of <UNK> br br this is pretty much the picture we get in city of god except that this time junior and the other guys come in starting in but <UNK> out eventually to a number of other <UNK> to give <UNK> classes that attract dozens of youth girls as well as boys their cultural or program formed in 1993 is a new alternative way of life for young black men in the <UNK> <UNK> it leads them to leave behind smoking alcohol and drugs that's the rule to explode into rap song <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> performances eventually the best of the performers led by wind up appearing before big local audiences with local producers and their has an international recording contract br br other centers and groups have been created by or through the over the years in and other <UNK> to seek the <UNK> of youth by providing training and staging performances of music theater <UNK> and dance at centers br br the performance arts aren't everything just the <UNK> point is also a movement for <UNK> social change gathering public awareness through such performances the centers also provide training in information newspaper radio internet e mail <UNK> <UNK> and sex education to seek to bridge gaps between rich and poor black and white and to offer <UNK> in audio visual work including production of documentaries the program is currently active in four other <UNK> br br there are many scenes of street and home life in rising and they look very much like the images in city of god with the important difference that the focus and outcome are very very much more positive not that it isn't an <UNK> battle and the corruption of the police the <UNK> of the social system and the indifference of the general population of brazil are not directly addressed by any of this but there's a scene where talks to some young kids in another cynical boys not enthusiastic about and determined to work in the drug trade as himself did as a boy doesn't seem to be convincing any of them despite pointing out that <UNK> don't make it to the age of fifty but we learn that the most negative boy in this group richard <UNK> joined the movement five months later there's also the account of a freak accident that disabled but with a positive outcome br br it would be great if the images were <UNK> and <UNK> and if the story were edited down a little but this is vibrant inspiring material and represents committed risk taking documentary film making and it's nice that rising has been included in seven film festivals and won a number of awards including best new documentary filmmaker at the <UNK> film festival it's currently being shown at the <UNK> of contemporary arts in london however a wide art house audience in the us seems somewhat unlikely br br included in the 2006
<START> this movie should have come with a <UNK> that it was akin to the left behind series i did not know it would be a bible <UNK> movie i expected it to truly be a movie about <UNK> and alien <UNK> for <UNK> sake as previous reviewer comments it would be fine to show at a church but not at a public theater at least not without the prior knowledge of what the premise of the movie is about i felt <UNK> out of my spent for this movie as nothing in the summary refers to its religious overtones if you go to church it'll probably be shown there for free some time other than the cover up of its true subject matter the movie was fine as far as acting and script were concerned but i have to say i walked out an hour into the movie when i saw what direction it was headed and that i was not going to be entertained but <UNK> to
<START> i knew little of this movie when i entered the theatre for an advance screening i gathered from the ads that it was a thriller br br what we have is like <UNK> meets <UNK> two teens decide to commit a perfect murder a victim is selected at random and then carefully executed so that no <UNK> of the actual murderers is found then a bunch of false leads are planted that point to an innocent <UNK> innocent of the murder anyway br br enter sondra <UNK> as the investigating officer imdb says that she's fbi but i don't remember that i thought that she was a regular cop she's frustrated by the <UNK> of the killers profile the profile doesn't fit the profile and by the power and influence of the father of one of the boys br br she's also has demons of her own which figure <UNK> in her to become a cop but this is the only character that is really more than one dimensional all others are pretty flat br br for a thriller there are really no big thrills it's mostly a cat and mouse game like an episode of <UNK> which she's watching at one point in the film the twist is that there are two involved in the killing just who is the real murderer justin or richard it'll cost you eight bucks to find out
<START> this is <UNK> highly entertaining drama with an excellent cast garfield is fine as a boxer hiding from the police with that <UNK> crew the dead end kids most notable of these is the beautiful billy <UNK> who has some very moving moments gloria <UNK> who in real life died very young in a house fire is strong and very attractive as sister and in the early scenes ann sheridan on the brink of stardom is a knock out may <UNK> is very funny as a <UNK> old <UNK> but claude <UNK> proves here that even a great actor can <UNK> if <UNK> cast whoever thought of casting him as a tough new york cop br br busby berkeley proves here that he was a fine director with or without musical numbers the film moves at a terrific pace and the water tower sequence is very suspenseful and well photographed the ending is contrived and the plot nothing startling or original but i still found this a highly enjoyable experience
<START> first let me review the movie this movie creeps me out and i don't even believe in aliens however the movie has its flaws br br there are three acts to this movie act one is perfect it sets up the movie and really builds up the creep factor i must say the score is great everything is set up and it's set up perfectly br br act two begins when <UNK> playing <UNK> burton goes to the shrink they <UNK> her and she recalls the <UNK> act two ruins the film when the aliens show up screaming mad george did the effects for the aliens i must say they did a good job except with their depiction of the gray aliens no offense but the <UNK> looked like door <UNK> br br on a side note i liked how they treated <UNK> in acts one and two if you paid attention you would notice that the husband and wife had two different memories in the husband's version of events the blue light <UNK> them and his wife says <UNK> here or something like it it makes sense the husband is concerned for his wife someone may hurt her that's his issue however in her version of events she says help me she does not say <UNK> here this also makes sense the aliens are after her wanting her husband to help and save her is her issue now back to the film br br act three turns the film into a gore fest it begins with a strange <UNK> it's a typical gore fest but it does have a surprise ending i won't ruin it because it's actually an interesting development br br the dvd and <UNK> takes itself too seriously but if you think <UNK> <UNK> saying <UNK> is funny you might want to check it out in the cast interviews section now on to my praise of <UNK> br br i could only hope <UNK> will read this i had never seen her before but wow what a performance let me tell the rest of you this first of all this is supposed to be a serious film the details i will now describe may sound campy and fun like <UNK> from the deep 1980 but it really isn't got that okay br br <UNK> is hot naturally good looking she is naked for a lot of the film a good thing unfortunately she is usually being <UNK> <UNK> and raped a very bad thing however she must act in a lot of this film naked she gets points for <UNK> that she has to act happy sad horny afraid and physically hurt all in the span of a few moments the <UNK> of emotion is astounding she has to cheer for joy when she learns she's pregnant she has to scream in terror when the aliens take out her guts she has to act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby isn't his she has to act like she's in denial saying nothing is wrong with her baby when her husband says otherwise a denial i should note that is really forced upon her by the aliens controlling her i am talking oscar caliber performance here br br then there is the rape scene it's disturbing but since it's just some rubber alien it's not too bad in this scene the alien is not a gray alien so i will describe it the alien has <UNK> and it's kind of like a table <UNK> is on the table like part restrained by the <UNK> by her head is the <UNK> head the <UNK> head is long and it <UNK> down so that its head is now above legs then the <UNK> hey comes out of his <UNK> it's <UNK> sounds pretty campy right well <UNK> plays it straight and she pulls it off she has to act like an alien with its hey coming from its <UNK> is <UNK> her and she pulls it off it's a very intense scene but that's not what makes it you see this scene is done in a flashback what makes the scene is performance <UNK> these events she is just lying in a hospital bed under <UNK> <UNK> the alien <UNK> but her acting here is more intense than the actual rape scene how many actors can pull off a performance in a scene that describes a rape that is more intense than the scene with the rape not many however <UNK> does it br br i could go on and on <UNK> if you ever read this i want you to know that i name <UNK> <UNK> of 1 believe you are the best actress ever you are the best actress ever i could only hope you read this and take it with you always br br as for everyone else <UNK> 1999 is an okay to good film i would recommend it
<START> <UNK> so emotionally powerful in its portrayal of urban blacks during the 50s and early 60s a culture of joy and sadness specific to working class blacks that existed outside the mainstream culture the characters of <UNK> <UNK> play depicted black individuals who lived <UNK> lives but <UNK> strong positive values of love loyalty and honor although the characters moved away from those values at times they did not deny the importance of the values instead they recognized and accepted their own <UNK> and those of the other characters without judgment that passed through the life of <UNK> the central characters were strong and believable the settings were realistic and brought back personal memories of a by gone era pre <UNK> urban life was a time of <UNK> <UNK> sight sound and smell that could almost be experienced by watching the drama <UNK> blues unfold i will watch it again and again
<START> true this is not john <UNK> finest film brother from another planet but it is not entirely forgettable either if not for any other reason than its message like batman wild <UNK> parents were murdered in front of him leaving him to <UNK> for himself in 'the zone ' a corrupt section of an <UNK> city where greed and violence reign supreme instead of falling in with the likes of <UNK> robert <UNK> wild thing fights for justice using his powers of <UNK> <UNK> and eerie cat impressions occasionally lighting himself on fire he becomes something of an urban legend a modern day robin hood and a hero for the ages 1987 at its finest wild thing lives
<START> i like <UNK> <UNK> as an actor he has played in several good movies <UNK> subway <UNK> but i can't even think he has played in that movie the story is nearly nothing the special effects are very bad and the actors also to resume the movie i have only one thing to say it's the first time that i go to watch a movie and want to leave after 10 minutes
<START> wow after seeing this film you will know why america's youth continues to lack intelligence and any traits to contribute to the <UNK> of society except for making themselves more inept to function br br jackass number two stars some of the most people imaginable who at there core lack any sort of talent or brains to make anything of themselves especially <UNK> and steve o and there only option for fame was to make a living entertaining those as stupid as them by <UNK> there being a guy drinking horse <UNK> just flat disgusting a man putting a fish hook through his cheek and acting as bait for sharks this isn't humor it's evidence for him br br overall i walked out of the theater with no hope for mankind
<START> this has no relationship to virtual encounters 1 so it's not really a sequel the two videos just share the general concept of people having <UNK> sex through a virtual reality machine so if you were really blown away by the story and dialog in <UNK> 1 yeah right and expecting a <UNK> in <UNK> 2 just be warned all the actors and actresses are new but it has the same excellent director <UNK> richards br br but like <UNK> 1 you get lots of beautiful women and a lot of great sex scenes that push the <UNK> of soft core just about as far as it can go br br if you have <UNK> 1 and you liked it you'll like <UNK> 2 if you don't have either but like really good <UNK> sex get both
<START> this is an enjoyable project that is not a film as the title suggests good performance by <UNK> who re <UNK> the role of grace i follows the re <UNK> of what happens to mike and grace in new york city she leaves but he wants to get in contact with her this project is his way of trying to getting in touch with her br br i saw it on <UNK> i have heard that it will be released on dvd as well i do like this trend of more independent projects this is an example of a good project br br i hope that he finds her br br take a look and be entertained br br
<START> <UNK> had a very interesting film on his hands with silver city however it somehow became very <UNK> as it progressed from beginning to end chris cooper did an exceptional job <UNK> the essence of his character a of sorts but he wasn't nearly given enough screen time instead we find ourselves on a rampage with a character that felt less personal less developed and overall too confusing the path that this danny huston leads us on inevitably becomes the downfall of the film too many characters are introduced to us in such a short time these characters randomly were involved with the progression of the plot which became too convoluted with each passing minute <UNK> knew what he was creating i just feel as if it wasn't being translated well to the silver screen br br <UNK> is a master of his trade his films continue to inspire and evoke thought even if they are not commercial <UNK> the trouble with silver city is that i think he found himself going too deep with not enough money or time to explain it all at the beginning of the film i had an idea of what was happening but as more and more characters were introduced as more and more plot twists tried to occur i lost the sense of the film by the ending while the ending was very clever and very dark i needed more explanation i think some of the reason that i lost my train of thought with this film was due to the casting of danny huston as our guide he was pathetic i didn't seem him as very exciting person to lead us on this adventure he seemed to go through the motions but not really accomplish much at all this was the first downfall of important film br br while i will admit that the characters played by richard dreyfuss <UNK> <UNK> james <UNK> and <UNK> hannah were interesting i just needed a better guide to help me understand their roles in this political scandal danny huston just did not cut it for me outside of the characters <UNK> needed a stronger script i sometimes felt that unless i was deeply <UNK> in the political world some of the references were well over my head the entire reasoning for silver city to be built and the corruption behind it <UNK> me i am a <UNK> that loves advanced films but this one just didn't make much sense to me there were several times that i found myself asking why instead of seeing the whole picture i felt as if the individual stories were as clear as glass yet the whole picture was dusty and murky at the same time <UNK> needed to concentrate more on the bigger picture instead of these smaller issues which ultimately <UNK> this film br br perhaps i went into this film with the wrong idea i was expecting to see another version of primary colors but instead witnessed something less heartfelt and more technical without giving the ending away i thought that the final scene was one of the most beautiful moments in political cinema history the brilliant symbolism has stayed in my mind for the past two days after watching this film while the rest of the movie quickly <UNK> away from my mind maybe a second viewing would do better for me but for some odd reason silver city just didn't click with me there seemed to be too many <UNK> that were never explained or <UNK> for an ensemble piece is always good with me but when the characters are introduced without explanation it just <UNK> steam this was one of those rare occasions br br overall i was very upset with this film being very <UNK> i wanted to see a side of politics that i wasn't aware of and another side that would make you chuckle i wanted to be <UNK> with the world of corporate money and the that are elected i wanted intelligent humor framed by the words of george w but instead all i found was a very confusing story aimed at a certain audience of which i will never be a part sad this picture had so much wasted promise br br grade out of
<START> the idea of bringing dracula to contemporary times isn't bad after all it might revive the series a bit by <UNK> a new story element into a series that hammer has all but exhausted in a long series of generally excellent movies however because the present day turned out to be the crappy early 1970s the results were pretty silly and looked more like love at first bite a deliberate comedy seeing christopher lee in a film filled with 70s hip <UNK> and electric guitar <UNK> and laughable rock music just seemed beyond stupid to make matters worse the acting is much more over the top here with an intense and silly performance by johnny <UNK> i also thought it was really funny that it took van <UNK> <UNK> to notice that <UNK> is dracula spelled backwards no one else figured this out for themselves wow what cunning br br so because so much of the movie was bad why did it still earn an almost respectable score of 4 well when the story came to the expected showdown between van <UNK> peter cushing and <UNK> christopher lee it was exciting and ended very well additionally and i know this will sound very sexist but if i had to watch a bad film at least stephanie character wore some really nice outfits that revealed her ample talents so to speak so at least it was a pretty film to watch br br by the way the film ends with the phrase may he rest in final peace at the end though this was not the final hammer dracula film with lee he returned for the satanic <UNK> of dracula just a short time later and it was in many ways even worse than this dud of a monster film
<START> great ensemble cast but unfortunately a bunch of undeveloped ideas make the film drag one feels not <UNK> at the end after waiting for some kind of conclusion closure or at least an ironic twist br br it had that familiar <UNK> feel without dare i say it larry as the annoying polar opposite the music was there the about <UNK> scenes pop up but without any common thread or suspense it <UNK> as a solo project that ran out of budget br br spoilers the movie title speaks about cheese but she prefers the rice <UNK> is cheese a better selling title than rice <UNK> he prefers just any junk food regardless of the sell by date maybe i want someone to eat <UNK> or ice cream in a pirate suit would have at least tied some scenes together br br marty this is just not funny and overdone people just don't care about a <UNK> within a show a coffee book table about coffee books was funnier br br unless you are big fans of the cast save your time and eat some cheese it doesn't even have to be with anyone
<START> <UNK> is probably the worst big budget movie of the 1990s it is so bad that it is watchable over and over again a bunch of folks with different <UNK> <UNK> deep into darkest africa where they encounter a temple of <UNK> just like in king <UNK> mines but with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> those <UNK> on their side the humans have a talking gorilla named amy who helps save the day at one point or another so much for the plot the dialogue throughout is witless the acting almost uniformly atrocious certainly campy tim <UNK> and ernie hudson are both on hand to assure the ham factor and the special effects abysmal wait until you see the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> oh yes did i mention there's a <UNK> <UNK> to top off the big finale laura <UNK> of all people is along for this of rides what could she have been thinking this is right around the same time she appeared with richard gere and ed norton in primal fear a movie that helped guarantee her stardom
<START> i liked this film a lot the actors were great particularly <UNK> who is different in every role <UNK> who is also able to play anyone and <UNK> who <UNK> things up she is also a talented singer she sings the song my truth heard when one character <UNK> up the <UNK> in the lab br br <UNK> is a good horror flick which pays attention to its characters it is also very gory at times and the set design is innovative it is too bad they had to make a sequel which is nowhere near the original br br on a side note two other things definitely worth mentioning the dvd is not dubbed which makes for a better experience of the film also make sure to keep watching after the final credits start rolling
<START> i won't lie i rented this film because it was an arty film with some possible explicit sex i got that scene and catherine <UNK> briefly shown breasts but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious european art films with lines like did i have a mother or father i don't know <UNK> usually delivered in long <UNK> br br if you are curious about the transition of art to porn might be an interesting look with use of the fast forward button i was still too slow
<START> as americans we have come to expect as par for the course when it comes to horror and unknown directors directing unknown actors acting for unknown writers we truly expect this to suck when they don't suck it becomes an over night success br br this is not an over night success nor is it an over the weekend or over the month success this blows from start to finish and my only recommendation is this go into this knowing it sucks enjoy it for what it is for what it isn't if you have something better to do keep this on the back way back <UNK> it's entertaining in the way watching the elderly cross a busy street during rush hour but don't expect much they almost never get hit by an actual car its just a lot of <UNK>
<START> documentaries about fans are always <UNK> and never worth seeing through but i found this one made by some of the fans themselves more than usually <UNK> as a veteran of the original <UNK> <UNK> forty years ago i'd hoped for more than the obvious which doesn't always <UNK> to the true if there's anyone living who doesn't already know the nature of a <UNK> any <UNK> from having been or known a fan he won't discover it here between <UNK> to which the actors from the films are particularly prone and acting out by fans making the most if not the best of their one shot at fame i could <UNK> little of the special appeal of lotr the special emotional <UNK> it evokes and the range of the special creative forms those <UNK> can take in addition the film is rather lazy it some facts that could have been got across with little effort e g what the exact legal <UNK> was the <UNK> of a <UNK> notice that <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the u s speaking of which i take strong exception to the film's <UNK> of the covers on that edition as irrelevant and psychedelic which they were not they were the work of jack a very able sf <UNK> of the period and some fans including me found them more apt and more attractive than the covers on the rival set
<START> silent historical drama based on the story of anne <UNK> newly arrived lady in waiting to the queen who catches the <UNK> eye of henry <UNK> bad <UNK> king of england who loves to feast drink hunt be entertained by his court <UNK> watch and chase around after young <UNK> who jump out of <UNK> and <UNK> attractive females around the castle well he's soon <UNK> his marriage married anne and telling her it is her holy duty to produce a male heir she fails on that score and he soon has his eye on yet another lady in waiting meanwhile anne spends pretty much the entire film looking <UNK> <UNK> or downright ready to burst into tears she just doesn't come across as a happy <UNK> or is it just bad acting br br this film is a solid piece of entertainment with an absorbing story that held my interest for two hours plus i enjoyed seeing the very lavish medieval <UNK> featured here on a gorgeous <UNK> <UNK> print <UNK> <UNK> is quite striking and memorable in his well done portrayal of king henry the <UNK> he really seemed like he was henry the <UNK> i am not so sure about the performance given by the actress who plays anne seemed a bit over the top the dvd of this film features an appropriate nicely done piano score that perfectly suits this story quite a good film
<START> five guys who were in the <UNK> <UNK> together reunite years later to go camping were they run into their childhood <UNK> as well as escaped <UNK> in this supreme unfunny supposed comedy most of the cast are content to simply phone it in and don't really seem to care about the film in the least the writers were so lazy that the names of the characters are for the most part the name of the actors that respectively play them richard <UNK> <UNK> gets really old really quick even the late great character actor <UNK> james can't save this stinker even though he's one of the few actors in the film that doesn't totally embarrass himself i hardly <UNK> a smile much less had anything that would reasonably be even <UNK> as a laugh awful br br my grade f
<START> airplane apart i don't think i've ever laughed at a film so much in all my life br br i love football like mad but i tend to hate almost any song or film about football as they tend to be unrealistic this wasn't br br i watched it once it was over 2 years ago it was brilliant everyone i know loved it i remember the gay the pitch at about a 45 degree angle and a player so named because he once turned up for training in a new pair of shoes brilliant that's what goes on in park football br br a definite 10 10 if anyone from the tv industry is reading this considering all the crap you repeat on english <UNK> please have the sense to show this again and the muppets while you're at it also does anyone know if this was shown on bbc or <UNK> i think it was <UNK> so it's worth asking them if they plan to show it again they should do
<START> watching stranger than fiction director marc <UNK> the <UNK> runner is the cinematic equivalent of eating your <UNK> because this art house epic rated pg 13 is good for your movie going <UNK> no this isn't the kind of movie that i like to <UNK> on the couch and <UNK> at the end of a tough day the <UNK> runner isn't your typical mainstream movie designed to entertain you and make you forget about your troubles first no celebrity stars appear in it second nothing is cut and <UNK> black or white or so outlandish that you don't believe an image that you see third the <UNK> runner <UNK> into subtitles when the characters occasionally speak in their native tongue fourth <UNK> film isn't a romantic <UNK> about boy wants girl boy loses girl and then boy wins girl back fifth this foreign language film may make you feel uncomfortable and challenge your <UNK> about life friendship and survival the chief themes here are <UNK> and redemption the protagonist commits a cowardly offense in the first half of the action that he must <UNK> for at the cost of his own personal safety and integrity right the <UNK> runner is about redeeming <UNK> for the sins of the past we're talking about personal <UNK> so don't rent or buy this wonderful movie for a boy's night out celebration or something to take the bad taste of the day out of your system based on <UNK> novel this <UNK> <UNK> melodrama about right and down initially looks like one of those light hearted friendship movies about <UNK> in the vein of the adventures of tom <UNK> and the about a half hour into its <UNK> minutes this <UNK> about two youngsters who fly <UNK> in afghanistan turns dark and <UNK> nevertheless if you can handle the remaining hour of the plot you'll emerge <UNK> <UNK> and perhaps even entertained

western the magnificent seven when they aren't flying <UNK> incidentally this is <UNK> flying like you've never seen <UNK> flying not only do the kids fly them but they also compete with other kids to

afghanistan to rescue he <UNK> as a <UNK> fighter but he doesn't carry a <UNK> the rescue scene in the <UNK> runner is rather like the escape scene from the midnight express while <UNK> doesn't explore the local politics or <UNK> us into the ethnic and cultural issues at stake here indeed <UNK> <UNK> david had to eliminate some parts of the book and the racial and ethnic prejudices aren't clearly <UNK> so you have to accept some things on faith <UNK> <UNK> the film in nearly china to give it an authentic look <UNK> deserves credit for making this two hour plus epic fascinating the performances especially by the children stand out for their believability the <UNK> runner is a film that you won't easily forget
<START> i saw this film with a live performance by the buffalo <UNK> and the music was one of the two things that definitely made the experience for me particularly the song after the battle where the woman is looking for her husband was just devastating the other thing that stood out to me is the battle on the ice itself a bit of <UNK> ripped off thoroughly by the makers of king arthur in 2004 also the battle goes on forever half an hour painfully long i can't think of another propaganda film that makes war look less glamorous or rewarding i'm surprised <UNK> liked this film so well i wouldn't want to go out and fight after watching it
<START> produced by international <UNK> pictures it looks as if filmed in a doll house everybody's a liar everything is dream like toy like for no good reason i'm not saying everything in all movies should be totally realistic but such unbelievable fantasy things and situations in one movie are way too much how did they get these fine actors actresses particularly to this movie it's nice to see <UNK> again if we were meant to understand why her husband wants to kill her <UNK> does do it well not funny not moving just fake stephen <UNK> briefly appears at the end fitting for a play maybe less for a movie but this isn't one to measure things at terrible
<START> i loved this it starts out as a fairly normal slightly <UNK> french art movie and then all of a sudden halfway through it's turned on it's head this part is brilliant as you realise you have been watching 2 plots not one sadly the ending doesn't make much sense which is a great shame oh yes and it's brilliantly filmed
<START> blade was a thrilling horror masterpiece and it was a brilliant movie with real great action i cant wait for blade 2 this is one of wesley snipes greatest movies the acting is great the story line is great everything about this movie is great
<START> it's a time machine all right it runs in real time for <UNK> minutes but it felt like <UNK> years the first 20 minutes were utterly superfluous massive amounts of dead time throughout what happened when will something happen who cares apparently the film was made on a tight budget i note for your <UNK> the following the nothing like saving a little money by <UNK> the sets and costumes from lord of the rings part i hey the scary dude in charge of controlling the the scariest thing these guys could think of was somebody wearing one of gene simmons of the band kiss old costumes little known fact freaks of the future have perfectly <UNK> nails br br save your money save your time pass on this one
<START> this movie really sucked hard it was just stupid with a terrible ending i love a really cheesy horror flick but this was terrible the trick ending totally <UNK> everything you've seen in the movie if you last <UNK> the end take my advice and steer clear of that dirty old <UNK> the <UNK>
<START> so many films are now in a genre described as comedy thriller as was this one a fine cast interesting premise but what an unpleasant film to watch into films then either saving grace or lock stock are far more enjoyable films rating just 2 out of 10 roach clips
<START> from the opening drum hit of we're gonna groove to the last guitar hit of whole <UNK> love this two dvd set might be one of the best music dvd's ever to hit the shelves since the beatles anthology was finally released earlier this year br br one of the best things about this dvd is that on disc 1 a whole concert and many television appearances can be found for instance the whole royal albert hall concert is on the dvd as well as some of the best performances from the <UNK> last concert at br br in the royal albert hall concert for instance the band had a lot of room to <UNK> jimmy <UNK> guitar <UNK> make <UNK> and confused a huge rock power <UNK> as opposed to the laid back blues song it was on led <UNK> i br br next on dvd 2 is a <UNK> video for the led <UNK> iii hit song immigrant song one of <UNK> hardest <UNK> songs the video is about as <UNK> as a pre mtv video was but it displays a lot of guitar power by jimmy page as it was taken from a live performance after the video ends we are treated in transition with a short picture of fans filling the seats at madison square garden the following are performances that were supposed to be part of the song remains the same but did not make the cut excellent <UNK> like those in the songs black dog and the ocean were both present br br after the madison performances we are treated with <UNK> court most of the led <UNK> iv material was played here like the most popular song that <UNK> ever recorded <UNK> to heaven it is brilliant as always even more so than the version on iv br br finally to end the 5 hours of live material is led <UNK> final concert in in august of 1979 as the viewer watches this they have to admit that robert <UNK> voice is getting and deeper from all of the screaming he has done in the past and it is evident here on songs like <UNK> and in the evening plant does not have his vocal boost of old yet on whole <UNK> love it returns for one more song br br overall one of the best musical dvd's ever released only next to the great beatles anthology <UNK> set that was released earlier in 2003 the sound both in 5 1 <UNK> and 5 1 <UNK> digital just like the beatles dvd gives you a feeling of being on stage with the performers standing right next to them as you would feel on the beatles dvd when they are <UNK> in the studio even though the beatles and led <UNK> are different bands though they each received different dvd's even though this set comes on only two <UNK> compared to the five disc beatles set it still feels very filling to the viewer after they have gone through all of that content it is also a pleasure to watch again and again not only because of the sound quality but because of the sheer energy on stage when robert plant begins to sing br br a brilliant effort from atlantic
<START> the kid power hour featured two segments hero high and let's start with hero high br br hero high was intended to be a new cartoon featuring their superhero identities the powerful <UNK> captain hero <UNK> betty and <UNK> however <UNK> couldn't get the rights to do it so they <UNK> it a bit and came up with this here's the breakdown of characters captain california <UNK> glorious gal betty <UNK> <UNK> dirty <UNK> <UNK> rex ruthless <UNK> principal <UNK> mr and miss <UNK> miss the show featured live action sketches as well as cartoon adventures the humor was the typical lame <UNK> jokes but at least it had a sense of fun about it it was entertaining enough for kids though not quite up to previous standards br br the other segment was which was very faithful to the comics unlike the previous live action show all of the major villains made appearances as well as the entire marvel family including <UNK> marvel in at least one episode uncle dudley had the correct <UNK> fields voice and shady character as well as his <UNK> acting up <UNK> <UNK> a veteran of 70's tv shows like fish voiced the big red cheese while alan <UNK> <UNK> wells in the early 6 million dollar man episodes and voice of <UNK> in he man handled dr br br the <UNK> had always had a sense of <UNK> to them so little <UNK> was required for their adventures to meet the broadcast standards and practices <UNK> the censors as such the stories were very imaginative and inventive amongst the villains who appeared were dr black adam mr <UNK> mr mind aunt <UNK> and the crocodile creatures mr <UNK> also made his on screen debut br br hero high is due to be released from <UNK> but is still in <UNK> as well as the live action show hopefully the <UNK> movie will help shake them loose on dvd it is well worth watching and deserving of dvd treatment
<START> last night i got bored and decided to watch a movie called <UNK> which i had once bought with a whole lot of other cheap movies from a <UNK> seemed like a good old action movie so i took out the <UNK> and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening well the pain started right from the beginning the main character is a boxer who is the <UNK> guy i have ever seen as the good person he has to be nice of course but he is just a <UNK> that totally doesn't fit with a boxer that has 28 and starts working for a <UNK> to earn some extra money even nice guys can still be cool well then came his first fight while he was working for this <UNK> every punch was clearly missed and that became even more annoying because the sound effect weren't <UNK> with the punches then there is this totally worthless acting of the whole cast and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is i gave it a 1 because i have never seen such a bad movie
<START> this is the best 3 d experience disney has at their this is certainly better than their original 1960's acid trip film that was in it's place is <UNK> better than honey i <UNK> the audience and far more fun barely <UNK> by the 3 d movie at disney mgm and can even beat the original 3 d movie experience captain <UNK> this film <UNK> some of disney's greatest musical hits from <UNK> the little mermaid and others and brought a smile to my face throughout the entire show this is a totally kid friendly movie too unlike honey and has more effects than the spectacular
<START> if there is such a thing as beautiful horror this film is one of the best in this genre it is a horror movie which despite not being void of gore scenes relies more on psychology and masterful building of the tension in order to create thrills and it is one of those movies so beautifully filmed where each scene is a full world of symbols and details all serving the scope and genre that it can be called but beautiful br br it is not an easy story with two sisters returning to their father and step mother mansion after having spent some time in a psychiatric institution they cope hardly with the death of their mother and they try to protect a world of theirs defending them against the adult world so the film seems to be at its most <UNK> <UNK> actually the film slowly <UNK> to something very different at slow pace but no frame is lost to convey the sense of thrilling beauty so i will not say much more watch it it is one of the best in the genre of far east horror films that <UNK> recently the world cinema and it really shows that they succeeded to do it for good reasons
<START> this movie should be called blame it on the script directed by stanley <UNK> of <UNK> in the rain fame this celluloid mid life crisis is not all bad it's got some lush scenes of <UNK> de <UNK> and various scantily clad extras <UNK> with each other and <UNK> around the beach to the <UNK> sounds of <UNK> but there is just something about watching fifty something michael caine get it on with whiny teenager michelle johnson that makes you feel well sleazy this storyline is a complete stretch too nobody but <UNK> and vain old studio <UNK> in hollywood could have green lit this embarrassment maybe they are so used to having young <UNK> as arm candy that they forget it's their fat <UNK> that hold the key to their appeal not their huge larry king style <UNK> and yellow <UNK> <UNK> teeth it's one thing for a <UNK> young <UNK> to have a crush on an older man but on her best friend's father who happens to be married and then to throw herself at him shamelessly ugh there's nothing entertaining about that it's rather pathetic and grotesque take note of a young <UNK> moore's budding <UNK> talent
<START> the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted it is a tale that <UNK> the american spirit and the american character this movie is a story from the early 20th century that is strangely relevant to the political landscape of the world in the beginning of the 21st century it is a true classic
<START> this is a powerful film which seems to have never re <UNK> after the joe mccarthy censorship period it influenced me as a jewish teen <UNK> who had friends of various colors and whose father's family had suffered under the fascist <UNK> in europe during the second quarter of the <UNK> century unlike the later rip off on the <UNK> which seemed to take some of the same themes and twist them to fit the <UNK> hollywood political correctness of the time it told its story direct and with respect for the characters and for the reality it reflected it was an <UNK> to gone with the wind birth of a nation triumph of the will and so many other of hatred and violence i would place it alongside the recent german film also virtually hidden in the us rosenstrasse br br i remember that the tv version also black and white in format as well as story was <UNK> out by some stations because the black hero's wife appeared white as a young civil rights worker it produced a conflict for me because on the one hand i was opposed to smoking <UNK> and on the other opposed the <UNK> in georgia of a <UNK> of the tv show a major <UNK> company i no longer remember which one does anyone else br br i would love to find a cd of either the film or the tv show to let my sons see something that informed my opposition to racism universally as opposed to only fighting racism against jews and recognition of the inherent connection between racism and
<START> porn legend gregory dark directs this cheesy horror flick that has <UNK> <UNK> kane from <UNK> wwe whatever it calls itself nowadays in his cinematic debut he plays <UNK> a blind serial killer who's <UNK> is taking people's eyes out the plot be it as it may has a group of troubled <UNK> cleaning up the historical hotel that <UNK> in and subsequently being <UNK> by him <UNK> it's not starts of as fun dopey b movie but soon gets too tedious to be enjoyable glad i went in with pretty low expectations but even those weren't met how can you have a porn king directing and still suffer from a lack of nudity for shame br br my grade d br br eye candy samantha noble <UNK> her ass briefly
<START> has arguably become one of the best tv series to come out of turkey with its unique cinematography and visual approach to filming the series has gained a wide following base with rating records continuously broken personally i do not agree with singers becoming actors hence <UNK> the lead actor but i guess the figures speak for themselves br br in relation to the movie it was disgusting to see how much someone can destroy such a <UNK> years in the making this movie was able to <UNK> every descent story that existed within the series not only that the cultural mistakes were <UNK> with an idiotic scene involving the family members dancing greek style and breaking <UNK> which does not exists anywhere within the turkish culture br br some argue the movie should be taken as a stand alone movie not as a <UNK> of the tv series but this theory has one major fall the way the movie was <UNK> was that it will be picking up where the series left off and will conclude the series once and for all so with that note in mind me and everyone i know would have asked for a <UNK> and accepted to stand outside the theatre to warn other victims
<START> basically a road movie the gay <UNK> and other gender <UNK> themes are rather disturbing particularly when the child is involved you do have to hand it to the costume <UNK> as for the actors the only one i was familiar with was <UNK> <UNK> i suppose it was a very good performance out of his or anyone's normal range the movie as a whole was shallow just a vehicle for the clever bitchy banter all in all i recommend this one
<START> owen loves his only he'd love her better six feet under in this dark laugh out loud comedy that both stars and is directed by danny <UNK> with admirable <UNK> from billy crystal and anne <UNK> in the title role br br throw <UNK> from the train is a terrific comedy even if it isn't a great film it's too shallow in parts and the ending feels less <UNK> than tacked on but it's a gut splitting ride most of the way with crystal and <UNK> <UNK> great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic takes on the essence of being a struggling writer <UNK> is avid but <UNK> crystal is <UNK> and bitter br br <UNK> professor <UNK> believes his ex wife stole his book the unfortunately titled hot fire and can't write more than the opening line of his next book which doesn't come easy he teaches a creative writing class of budding <UNK> including a middle aged woman who writes tom <UNK> type fiction but doesn't know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through and an salesman who wants to write the story of his life mr is probably the funniest character for laughs per minutes on screen an wearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his <UNK> 100 girls i'd like to <UNK> br br then there's <UNK> owen lift who calls himself professor <UNK> star <UNK> even though the teacher won't read his work in class owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie a man child in his late 30s who lives with his overbearing mother anne <UNK> who calls him and other endearing sentiments in any other movie we'd be asked to feel sorry for owen but throw <UNK> from the train <UNK> life's <UNK> onto this sad sack for laughs and expects us to go along that's one big reason why this film probably loses a lot of people br br for those of us who enjoy the humor of this character even <UNK> with him and take the rest of what we see here as a <UNK> it's not as big a stretch to go along with the bigger <UNK> this comedy takes asking us to watch in amusement while owen <UNK> professor <UNK> help in a plan to kill his mother actually he first goes to hawaii to kill <UNK> hated ex then tells the professor it's his turn to kill mrs lift <UNK> murders as seen in hitchcock's strangers on a train br br as a director <UNK> not only <UNK> his actors' performances with scene setting that places the accent on dialogue he makes some bold visual statements throwing in bits of amusing <UNK> to keep the audience on its <UNK> and away from taking things too seriously br br also helping matters is writer <UNK> silver who keeps the laughs coming with his <UNK> <UNK> you got rats the size of here she's not a woman she's the terminator one little murder and i'm jack the <UNK> those are all <UNK> words but some of the funniest lines which work only in context but absolutely kill are <UNK> and <UNK> apparently silver never wrote another screenplay after this according to the imdb and that's a shame because he had real talent for it br br the best scene in this movie when crystal meets <UNK> was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical <UNK> presentation the only time i've seen a movie promoted that way owen introduces the professor to his mother as <UNK> patty ' and when <UNK> says he doesn't have a cousin patty <UNK> owen loses it <UNK> <UNK> to me ' he yells out <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> with a pan br br of course in reality the professor wouldn't <UNK> out something witty from the floor but <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> works effectively at such moments when playing its looney tunes vibe for all its worth <UNK> hasn't disappeared from films of course but it's a mystery why he hasn't really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie maybe it's because as <UNK> <UNK> from the <UNK> lack of mainstream success shows his kind of vision isn't to everyone's tastes that's too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over and like it

<START> i just finished watching this horribly depressing drama and realized that in light of recent dramas such as these the only ones who could be considered <UNK> are those who are least aware that life is nothing more than tragic i would suggest how <UNK> <UNK> and counter <UNK> this conclusion is even if relationships and <UNK> like those presented in this movie are grounded in fact to some degree but instead i realized that these films have made the very determination of the great tragedy trivial when the same boring situations the same <UNK> dysfunctional families and friendships continue to play out just have they been over and over again in some sort of attempt to knock out previous <UNK> of family life much of it existing in the 1950s and earlier with personality and character <UNK> being made ever so subtle <UNK> it instead with the reality of how things actually are that in fact what we are watching is no longer the dysfunctional but in fact a normal existence and set of circumstances that has actually existed all along but of which we may have been previously been unaware and thus have ignored or at least denied br br only problem is that too many films have been trying to make this point and by doing so in nearly identical form when i had read the synopsis for the film i immediately thought of <UNK> storm ' while watching the depressing of the travis family which seemed to endure repeated emotional <UNK> i immediately <UNK> <UNK> beauty ' and in some regards the interactions between the parents and the middle child tim i drew similarities from goes down ' <UNK> may be a novel experience maybe a refreshing one deemed so for an honest portrayal of character that as said before is often not <UNK> to exist in the films of family which is idiotic to think anyways considering we were already seeing these kinds of relationships displayed in films like <UNK> <UNK> as early as 1980 and which go back even further than that but to the well <UNK> viewer these films may offer nothing new they have in fact become a rather tired <UNK> of too many filmmakers who may try to out do the other with the amount of trauma and <UNK> they can pack into one family and here it <UNK> to neighbors and friends in fact heroes ' the latest in this genre i do think there have been enough films to accurately <UNK> it a <UNK> <UNK> so many disasters and surprises into one family that they would make prize finds for a daytime talk show host it is the story of a family who is tested by the suicide of the <UNK> son a talented and <UNK> <UNK> who hated the sport with a passion the youngest son knew this the father was in a <UNK> and <UNK> by the push for <UNK> in his all star son and it's not clear that the mother and sister had much of a relationship with the young man br br granted it is no less entertaining to some extent for those who find this material <UNK> depressing after a while and the performances are quite good especially by <UNK> weaver and jeff daniels but i sure hope that filmmakers in the future wishing to add to the commentary of struggling <UNK> relationships which <UNK> or not always seem to be upper middle class white suburban families intend to offer something new by way of material and insight i should see no distinction and consequently no purpose otherwise
<START> this one started excellently the photography and audio are the best i've experienced in years okay months especially the use of and colours in single sequences is astonishing also making jennifer lopez <UNK> most of her lines is an idea in itself but i'm not sure what <UNK> wants to accomplish with that br br now for the <UNK> the screenplay was awful <UNK> part turned out to be irrelevant or totally worthless to the plot she seemed to star the movie only to sell herself and the <UNK> the three <UNK> seemed just too obvious the of the child carl was a psychologically too <UNK> way to <UNK> the motive which carl under and so on br br anyway the movie had great way of showing where <UNK> comes from why is it that the most talented directors seem to emerge from india nowadays
<START> <UNK> <UNK> once again proves that he is the best actor working in <UNK> without a doubt his recent movies involved shouting his lines that does not <UNK> well for the theater trained <UNK> one wonders why he is always not given his <UNK> during awards season br br <UNK> the power was one of his flicks that was an utter along with a missed to create screen magic with amitabh bachchan br br but <UNK> exudes a cool calm in this film playing a cop on a sort of social justice journey <UNK> the streets of <UNK> of underworld <UNK> in fake encounters character takes control of the screen and the viewers attention and never lets go the editing is tightly paced and there are no annoying songs to distract from the story br br along the same lines as the modern day cult classic company the movie is well acted directed and should have a long shelf life on dvd br br the final ten minutes that see <UNK> and the main villain talk at his <UNK> <UNK> are bound to be part of hindi cinema classics won't be <UNK> with this cops and robbers flick
<START> this film by director of children of nature is powerful it has great music by and good acting it shows how sad insanity as a disease can be there are many good jokes but the humor is dark if that is not a problem then you should see this film note though this is not a comedy but a drama
<START> no really im not kidding around here folks and i so cant believe how many people here have given it really really positive reviews oh wait its the imdb comments section silly me its interesting to note that at this date there have not been enough votes to give this film a rating out of ten yet there are dozens of comments that rave about the film what does this mean i wonder anyway the script is terrible character change their personality and motivation and actions every scene in order to keep the movie running along at something that vaguely <UNK> a pace it <UNK> even dumb behaviour that was there too but the pure idiocy of the script <UNK> any <UNK> the characters displayed for instance karl is <UNK> an order because there are two dead bodies in the desert and the killer is out here somewhere so he forces everyone to travel in order to find the killer <UNK> orders and p everyone off when the hero spots something nasty in the darkness and warns karl karl tells our hero to stop being an idiot and that there's nothing out there so they are all going home next scene he is <UNK> to let it go and must hunt down whatever it is it is just a joke yes the monster is very impressive but the crap that the humans say about it just tries to <UNK> out its interesting aspects and the predator and alien rip off moments were very tedious and the ending the ending jesus the worst film i saw the year and i saw bug buster
<START> i saw le on the 2005 <UNK> <UNK> it was the first of ten films i saw there br br le has left the most powerful impression of the ten films from the first shot you know the movie is going to be something special the beautiful cinematography left me in awe of what can be done with a camera the music is also on par with the visuals <UNK> the colorful and stylish architecture like images br br toni plays the main character in the film he's a tax expert gone wrong who lives in a hotel every week he brings a <UNK> with money to a bank and the story plays around this br br he is always very controlled and shows almost no emotion to anyone looks <UNK> and well dressed he has a habit of ignoring people who are of no significance to him for example <UNK> played very nicely by olivia <UNK> who works as a <UNK> in the hotel where he lives although she's been working in the hotel for two years he never <UNK> her even if she does <UNK> him on one day she confronts him with this and the next day he sits at the bar instead of his usual spot at a window from here the story really begins and will unfold in a strong tale of love sacrifice and the mafia br br i won't spoil the rest of the film see this film if you love stylish movies like ones from david lynch the godfather etc don't see this if you're an action buff
<START> whatever you do don't stop watching when you think the movie is over hang around for the first <UNK> of credits or you'll really miss something we saw this movie at the film festival and thought it was the best of the bunch <UNK> is a marvel really not only because of her performance but because she can pull it off so far above the ground at the q a she said there were no <UNK> or effects so everything you see is really her going for it couldn't make it to the festival because she was dancing with madonna she was excellent and my <UNK> so beautiful i was amazed that the film went over so well with the blue haired lady crowd but there you have it isn't a <UNK>
<START> sick of the current cinema <UNK> particularly american cinema i've been making an effort to see the oscar winning foreign films that's when i came across this gem slow to start it picks up nicely once war is <UNK> basically an old fashioned girl waits for boy to return from war story the performances the cinematography make this so very much more why as the young woman didn't become an international star after this is beyond me though she has remained successful in her own country you take the journey with her young <UNK> <UNK> young girl who through the <UNK> of war becomes a very sober somber woman who keeps a <UNK> of hope her final scene is devastating we love her as much as the camera does and the camera work was this the <UNK> in hand held camera work it truly adds an <UNK> to the story and the beauty of it like when character is running up stairs and next to a fence i am <UNK> and grateful to see this film
<START> hadn't really heard too much about this movie so i went and saw it i realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world and even those people would think this movie moved too slowly br br when the movie opens up you see nicole kidman going to a <UNK> camp <UNK> shock that scene the <UNK> were all great and then the movie went downhill br br while i respect the vision the filmmaker must have this movie sucked it was too slow too predictable and not moving enough robert downey jr is great as usual but this movie is not good enough to sit through it tries to be shocking and <UNK> but makes poor use of the talents of all the actors br br don't waste your money even the sex scenes were boring
<START> all but the youngest americans are probably familiar with the iconic call of from little timmy or whatever the kid's name was <UNK> his little <UNK> head off for his border <UNK> friend these same americans may or may not be familiar with the fact that <UNK> made the leap from television to movies or was it the other way around i'm clearly too lazy to do any research here and the painted hills is one of those it is irresistible to make a this movie has gone to the dogs pun so i won't even though i technically just did but in a way it has <UNK> playing <UNK> man's best friend gets top billing the dog gets top billing now i'm not familiar with how actors or their agents <UNK> <UNK> but here's how it plays out in my mind br br movie <UNK> okay <UNK> in the credits it's gonna be and with <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> movie <UNK> ha ha kid calm down calm down <UNK> movie <UNK> okay i think i see co lead billing <UNK> movie <UNK> oh god let go of my arm top billing top billing for you now let go of my arm br br so the dog gets top billing and with the rest of this shell shocked cast i suppose it's understandable we get lovable old jonathan the <UNK> his young whiny and apparently <UNK> friend tommy <UNK> loser lin taylor and lovable old religious pilot pete the meat of the plot here could be summed up in a few sentences so i'll save you the actual pain of watching the movie jonathan is a <UNK> with a dog named <UNK> and his partner dies while he is at his claim he gets a new partner named lin who becomes obsessed with the gold and jonathan for some reason gives <UNK> to whiny little <UNK> tommy lin kills jonathan <UNK> sees it and lin tries to kill <UNK> then lin tries to kill tommy then tommy <UNK> it gets cold and <UNK> carries out an elaborate plan to get revenge on lin which he or she does the end br br unless you have a deep unsettling need to see a <UNK> movie even then there's got to be a better <UNK> movie than this just avoid the painted hills when it's not dragging on <UNK> at <UNK> limited ability to <UNK> similar in style perhaps to keanu reeves always the same facial expression only the body moves setting up the obvious using several minutes of film or insulting native americans everywhere with its white actor in ugh how me running bear stereotypes the painted hills is fit only for <UNK> <UNK> or people who have some kind of connection to <UNK> through their days as a <UNK> old <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> that vein of <UNK> gold
<START> a man <UNK> is found floating in the sea among the <UNK> of his destroyed boat just off the florida coast a helicopter him up only to reveal both of his legs are missing below the knees dr stella dickens valentine and her partner dr bob hogan lawrence are marine of some sort and are <UNK> research in the sea regarding <UNK> while out at sea hogan hears a strange high pitched noise intrigued he and stella hire peter micheal and his assistant sandra <UNK> to create a device to locate and track the source or something like that anyway as it isn't made particularly clear meanwhile a scientist named <UNK> de as stewart who works at a rival <UNK> called the <UNK> ocean is brutally murdered when she threatens to expose someone within the <UNK> more people are attacked and sheriff gordon <UNK> as john is on the case peter stella hogan and sandra all set out to sea soon enough they find evidence that something monstrous and very <UNK> may be lurking beneath the surface together with rival scientist professor donald west william <UNK> sheriff gordon and the united states army they set out to destroy the monster but there are other sinister forces at work as someone doesn't want the <UNK> <UNK> creature to be exposed at any cost directed by <UNK> <UNK> as john old jr this is a far cry from the classic italian horror and splatter films of the 70's and early 80's the script by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> is <UNK> slow and will put most people to sleep well before the 90 odd minute run time has <UNK> the monster is barely used large portions of this film are made up of footage of <UNK> and <UNK> large <UNK> of the first half concentrate on the not so mysterious <UNK> behind <UNK> part of the story there isn't really any gore to speak of a guy with both his legs bitten off and someone with one arm is about it the special effects on the monster itself are generally poor and it is shown in very quick flashes disappointing the cast of virtual <UNK> don't help make this any easier to sit through there really isn't much to recommend this film so i won't don't bother you can do a lot better
<START> first i must point out that the role <UNK> corey played was exceptional usually corey was <UNK> to supporting roles but here he is what helps carry this very limp film without him and the character he played the film would have been a lot worse hardly a 2 or 3 br br so why did i hate the rest of the film so much well one of my pet <UNK> is when characters act too stupid to live you can't base major plot points on the <UNK> that your major characters are completely stupid unless having a brain injury is part of the plot of course but this is exactly what happens in this film <UNK> corey is a crazed man who has murdered three innocent people and they know his next target is joseph wife so what do they do yep they provide really <UNK> police protection and a plan that makes no sense at all no <UNK> and guys with <UNK> that are so far away they probably won't stop this madman and if this isn't bad enough the marked woman inexplicably runs away from her hiding place and walks right into the worst possible place she could be is anyone that stupid i hate when movies have such dumb characters in fact i found myself rooting for corey since i felt the idiots deserved to die for their <UNK> in addition to these clich√©d characters there was also a bit player who <UNK> sure seeing your husband shot might cause someone to faint however in real life this is a rare <UNK> people rarely faint unless there is a medical reason so combining this with the above character problems is a real nightmare for people who are looking for realism something film noir movies must have br br all these serious problems are even more <UNK> since <UNK> <UNK> character is amazingly well written and conceived it was his chance to shine as an actor too bad the rest of the movie was so limp that corey and the basic plot idea are sunk this is one film that could really use a remake but this time without brainless characters
<START> what do you get when you have a <UNK> seasoned french police inspector by the name of maurice <UNK> is called to solve a murder case well simply a very entertaining fun film the re <UNK> black and white film <UNK> des delivers the goods despite romance jealousy and marriage that seem to just get in the way towards the truth of <UNK> done it ' br br inch by inch technique by technique as seasoned by experience and <UNK> the patience of this master inspector <UNK> into the truth but of course with the help of a bag full of dirty police <UNK> tricks br br <UNK> is the <UNK> of this film the use by director <UNK> georges <UNK> of <UNK> background music to <UNK> the drama in grand film noir style is a wonderful <UNK> around the visual experience br br <UNK> eventually <UNK> the mystery and <UNK> the <UNK> hey he is good but alas <UNK> too can keep a dark secret in his past who is that boy that is perhaps not his son br br some things can never get solved even beyond the closing credits
<START> i just recently watched ed wood jr 's <UNK> movie <UNK> or glenda for the first time after having heard so much about it for so many years nothing i had read or heard about this film could prepare me for what i saw this has to be the most bizarre movie ever made <UNK> buffalo women in bondage satan <UNK> around and bela lugosi rambling only as he can pull the string pull the string it was totally insane the acting was atrocious and the dialog was unintentionally hilarious exactly what one would expect from an ed wood film having said all that as horrible as this movie was i have to give wood credit he was way ahead of his time you have to remember that when this movie was made <UNK> were not even discussed in public much less the subject for a movie i have read that wood was a <UNK> in real life and i'm sure this movie was based on his own experiences it was sad to see bela lugosi having to say the ridiculous lines he had to say for this film but it was kind of ed wood jr to at least give mr lugosi an acting job at a time in <UNK> life when he was <UNK> and a drug addict and no one else in hollywood would hire him if you have never seen this film then you have to see it especially if you are a fan of ed wood jr
<START> having lived in upper <UNK> 30 miles from in the mid 1990s i was eager to see this film it begins <UNK> enough with some superficial understanding of the values and quirks of u p life but jeff daniels apparently was not content with a low key approach that would have been fitting given the place and the people instead he introduces extremely crude humor and some wildly inappropriate mystical supernatural elements although there is a good movie to be made about this practically unknown region of the u s this is not it
<START> this was terrible mean spirited and full of the worst clich√©s and racial stereotypes i've seen in a <UNK> time seeing hayden p trying to act ghetto was painful hi one <UNK> leg up on <UNK> <UNK> and some <UNK> make you down with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pretty much <UNK> through the entire movie most of the set sequences look like they were filmed in cardboard boxes what was up with the finale and poor <UNK> was just plain exploited to get people to watch her act which she can't br br put simply this film even deserve one star please put this tired franchise to rest or at least make the next one bring it on iv <UNK> vs freddy jason
<START> this movie gives us some wwii history along with some touching romance a little fantasy and meaningful emotion and beautiful scenery nicholas cage never fails us and here again does a great job and so do the other principle characters one key <UNK> the <UNK> father played by john <UNK> delivers to his daughter one of the best <UNK> of love i've ever heard some of the events are a bit too <UNK> to be real but i <UNK> that knowing that this is partly fairy tale and my wife and i really liked the film and it is nice to watch people taking the risks to love the enemy one man who left the theatre near us said to his wife now that's the way to <UNK> war i think you'll see what he means when you watch the italian <UNK> of this lovely greek island
<START> a fascinating slice of life documentary about a husband and wife and their marriage told through the eyes of their son we all like to think that our parents lived happy lives that their <UNK> were full of <UNK> love and happy memories sadly many of us know this not to be the case of their own families and that of their parents this wonderful little documentary is told through the camera lens and emotional perspective of the son of a family that has just experienced the death of their mother the son being a documentary film maker has filmed his elder family for many years for as he states <UNK> three months after the death of his mother his father <UNK> his long time secretary the <UNK> of this <UNK> <UNK> the family and pushes the son to dig into the past lives of his mother and father what he reveals is a fascinating look into the lives of two rather ordinary people who like so many of their generation married early for the wrong reasons and found themselves stuck in a family life where they found they just had to make do a wife who found herself at times <UNK> lonely and <UNK> and a husband who <UNK> himself in his work she and intellectual at heart he a much simpler individual who seems to find most of his pleasures in the quiet <UNK> of work they are obviously wrong for each other this much is clear yet they stick it out for what well that's part of the mystery they clearly show affection for each other at times if not ever much love you won't find any truly shocking <UNK> here aside from infidelity on both sides which in good part is what makes this such a gem you really feel that these could be your own parents if circumstances were different and indeed makes one question the lives of ones own parents
<START> put simply this mini series was terrible let me count the ways 1 absurd plotting 2 over acting 3 <UNK> approach to characters 4 annoying narration 5 inability to create viewer interest br br this film can't even pass the soap opera for <UNK> test i'm sorry i have not read this award winning novel so i am judging it only as a film but it really stinks imagine going to a party where they show you dozens of <UNK> you look at the wide variety and want to taste them but suddenly they are <UNK> and you wonder where they went that's like this film with way too many characters introduced and never drawn out there are enough stories and characters in this film to create a 20 episode series yet we are given less than four hours to <UNK> it all br br there are more facial expressions and reaction shots of ed harris than you'll find on 10 000 monkeys the pace is extraordinarily slow br br dennis <UNK> and helen hunt are so far over the top that their characters are not believable <UNK> character is one dimensional br br the <UNK> river metaphor becomes trite br br and probably the most absurd part of the film the cat this evil and vengeful cat who follows the hero around to scratch him and his seat covers well come on now it's not even good stephen king br br probably the most interesting character in the film and one who is not drawn well is john <UNK> the disturbed boy whose final act of desperation accounts for the only plot device that works in this film br br just about everyone in this film is unbelievable br br to sum up there's little here to inspire the drama is poor melodrama it's just a terrible effort
<START> although they died with their boots on is not entirely historically accurate it is a very entertaining western not only is flynn the perfect <UNK> the character actors are superb besides the action portion of the movie flynn and love scenes are very touching and believable flynn and <UNK> were very fond of each other in real life flynn was always so tormented for being not taken seriously if only he knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well
<START> eaten alive goes down much easier than <UNK> <UNK> cannibal holocaust but it's also a far more <UNK> film i mean at times it can be unintentionally hilarious but the plot is so mind numbingly idiotic that it was impossible for me not to lose all patience by the end tough guy robert cannibal holocaust teams up with janet the gates of hell here with an <UNK> accent to search the <UNK> of new guinea for sister who's been <UNK> by the leader of a religious cult <UNK> <UNK> along the way they fall witness to sometimes real animal torture and some <UNK> rendered <UNK> as directed by <UNK> the movie is so over the top it's hard to take seriously but if you enjoy trash cinema with more than a few unintentional laughs it's not bad br br 4 10
<START> i watched this series after <UNK> the <UNK> for which i gave 10 10 grade i had read user comments on this and i expected an equally good series or if possible even better at this point i must emphasize that this series is good and it definitely captured me throughout it and thus worth watching however i didn't enjoy it as much as <UNK> the <UNK> for the following reasons br br 1 less passion love and related sexual content there were surprisingly little emphasis in these elements which i held integral for a love story felt like a watered down version of <UNK> the <UNK> br br 2 similarly as in <UNK> the <UNK> the story had three parts the beginning a shocking second part and the ending the second part should have been the climax of the story as in <UNK> the <UNK> but instead it was almost totally <UNK> perhaps due to inability to make shocking but believable asylum content the series should have been in three parts featuring two <UNK> with a lot more focus on the second part br br 3 almost no weight was given to what were and how it affected their personalities i found it rather annoying that the series did not properly address such central topic br br 4 the ending was much more <UNK> than in <UNK> the <UNK> left several interesting plot lines open br br despite these shortcomings is a good series and well worth 7 10 however it is not a classic like <UNK> the <UNK>
<START> was curious to know the name of the <UNK> village where the filming in italy was done i know the name villa san however would like to know the exact location in <UNK> the cinematography is excellent and it would be wonderful to visit that area i would also be interested to know what the location of the desert shooting is as well travel <UNK> in europe and africa and would am interested in visiting the areas that the book and film were about please e mail me with any information on the sites that any one might have we would be very grateful and if any one knows if the villa in <UNK> is still <UNK> that would be awesome as well i <UNK> any information and i thank you in advance for your time
<START> this film is bone chilling in a way that is hard to describe while it is fairly accurate in its description of the events leading up to and the subsequent investigation regarding the first attempt to destroy the world trade center in 1993 seen now post 9 11 it is almost unbearable br br it would be a mistake to call this film <UNK> but it certainly makes the common <UNK> wisdom of fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me come alive br br our government learned nothing from the 1993 attempt on the world trade center and subsequent <UNK> of the 9 11 report show that many of the mistakes that led to the bombing in 1993 were repeated br br some people have criticized the first and fourth of the us <UNK> as being partly responsible for the <UNK> terrorists being able to carry out their evil plans but that is wrong headed in every possible way br br surely the people making this argument are not supporting a <UNK> on free speech a free press or freedom of religion i certainly hope they are not supporting our government officials being able to break into any person's home or office to search without cause or without a warrant br br the fact is the fbi the ins and even the local police could have gotten <UNK> based on the information they had in their possession but they chose not to for a variety of reasons besides no matter how <UNK> or ignorant it is it is not illegal to speak badly about america or its leaders likewise it is not illegal to either own guns or to pray toward <UNK> br br consider this until lee harvey <UNK> actually fired his rifle at president john kennedy he wasn't really breaking any laws living in a free society has its <UNK> br br still path to paradise is a must see film that i am afraid will never be seen by that many people as far as i know it is not on dvd and 2007 is its <UNK> <UNK> and there are no known <UNK> of it br br i'm not really surprised people don't like to document their failures and this film certainly shows that the various <UNK> that were supposed to protect us did not do their jobs right and for the of reasons like <UNK> and a <UNK> to share information br br this is a shame as path to paradise is well done and gripping and as many have stated before the final scene where <UNK> played by art <UNK> the <UNK> who built the truck bomb that was used in the first attempt at destroying the two towers is flying past the world trade center after his capture and simply says next time we will bring them both down is a film moment that <UNK> me in place for several minutes
<START> after watching a texas tale of <UNK> you feel a <UNK> disgust for the nature of the hollywood beast inside the interviews and conversations of all involved with the project there is a common sense of <UNK> and <UNK> that <UNK> backgrounds social and even <UNK> this can be attributed to hard work on the entire <UNK> <UNK> commitment to the project and the love the of the story from the original film and the complete creation of <UNK> that is it's creator the scale of people involved in <UNK> holiday was amazing to me at a no budget no glory production there were no trailers or craft services no <UNK> at all and yet everyone involved stuck right there with it if nothing ever comes of this project productions have laid their foundation for being a serious honest company that's never going to lay down and take it or sell out and make a movie just for the money i'd like to see any l a director go through the <UNK> process to get a shot more realistic true to life cinema is lacking in this time of cg and green screens the masses may enjoy their entertainment <UNK> fed to them in nice bite sized <UNK> calm bits but there is a large group of people out here in the world that share the opinions and insights of the filmmakers that still make films for the love of the material or love of storytelling not dvd sales or box office i loved this documentary and i hope that <UNK> has the to pick it up and air it so that maybe just maybe one more person will decide to pick up a camera and film some real life so we the viewer can have even a temporary understanding that everyone everywhere is the same and anyone anywhere can be a true <UNK>
<START> i remember all the hype around this movie when <UNK> was killed being a fan of ms <UNK> novels my first thought was how can they do queen of the damned without doing vampire <UNK> first br br having finally seen the movie now i can see how they did it if you have read these books imagine taking out the gory parts from vampire <UNK> <UNK> marcus and <UNK> into one character and <UNK> everything to do with beginning the wolf hunt his <UNK> playing the theatre of the vampires and also louis <UNK> and <UNK> then in the last 15 minutes <UNK> in queen of the damned br br what we loose is a very important piece of character his inner agony of having to kill to live the fact that he carefully tries to <UNK> killers as his victims and his love hate relationship with louis <UNK> <UNK> and all the other vampires br br also important to the story is that we loose the story of the twins which is the <UNK> of ms <UNK> vampires and while i am sure the <UNK> was to intense for showing on the screen they could have done something closer and showed us more of ancient egypt br br even worse we have this love interest thrown in between jessie and <UNK> the vampire chronicles is basically an american story for those that do not know is another form of <UNK> japanese porn comics but in it is about gay male relationships told by a female while i am sure many men object to the <UNK> of the characters in this movie they went to the far extreme the opposite way for instead of <UNK> killers he goes after young female <UNK> br br and the other flaws in logic and storyline are vast at the beginning <UNK> emerges from a century long sleep then later on asks <UNK> how he made it through the 1950's in red <UNK> <UNK> has no idea who elvis is and says he slept through that period makes you wonder how <UNK> knows about 50's fashion and music since he slept through the same time period himself and nothing is ever even mentioned about louis <UNK> or <UNK> i think that is a huge shame is like seeing snow white and the 3 <UNK> br br overall the movie i thought was really bad about the only good thing about it was the soundtrack most of the acting was poor the accents drove me up the wall and all of the really in depth parts of the book were removed leaving us only with a hollow shell kind of like after he was sucked dry br br if you want to see a good modern vampire movie get lost boys the original interview with a vampire or even some old episodes of dark shadows let this one rest in piece with a stake through the heart of <UNK> around the neck and a <UNK> of holy water in the mouth br br in ending remember that before <UNK> was killed this was intended to go straight to video no theatrical release was planned it is obvious now why this was it is only sad that somebody as talented as she will be remembered for this dog of a movie instead of something where she really might have <UNK> br br i rate this a 2 on a scale of 1 10
<START> it¬¥s a movie to see on tv and only once i mean it¬¥s good but it¬¥s a little too lengthy and the plot is so well known it <UNK> very original but it <UNK> boring the best thing of the movie are the performances natalie portman and susan sarandon are great actress and in this movie they have done a great job i give it a 7
<START> is a murder mystery these movies tend to be popular br br and the 6 9 rating it currently has suggests that it has been too br br unfortunately this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever br br a few non spoilers for instance include a 5 minute scene br br <UNK> the main character eats an apple and another 3 minutes br br where he <UNK> br br in case you were wondering this is not in fact art neither is it a br br commentary on humanity which from the title it seems it is trying br br to be it is in fact boring there are numerous attempts in this br br movie to say something about humanity one might think to br br how would i comment on humanity and the most br br obvious and boring answers will of course be sex love and death br br not that these <UNK> are uninteresting when done well just that br br they are the <UNK> <UNK> for sex this movie does its best to br br make it unattractive and disgusting in your first five minutes br br hence this is not a spoiler you will see the <UNK> <UNK> of a br br murdered 11 year old girl it's a murder mystery remember later br br on a few people throw themselves at each other and have what br br the director would like us to believe is raw sex but in reality it's br br contrived and overly symbolic but worse yet so br br i enjoy being disturbed by movies this movie showed me why br br disturbing movies usually show something inside of someone br br their humanity which they did not know existed and are a bit br br scared of tried to do just this and failed and i walked br br out of the theatre not disturbed but disgusted thinking that i had br br wasted my time in the theater despite having seen the movie for br br free
<START> this movie was ridiculous from the start let me save you all time from watching this movie a woman who sells corn <UNK> to the locals takes in her cousin or nephew and he convinces her to open a <UNK> <UNK> from her home she does and she and the cousin become close there is a scene later where she is <UNK> lips with him later the woman finds out an old boyfriend is coming back from jail and its tense between them leading to a down and out fist fight in the <UNK> the woman's cousin nephew is <UNK> by the man the ending was awful the story was awful and if i could get back the time wasted on this movie i would appreciate it a definite skip
<START> i saw this movie as a child and fell in love with it it has a sweet sensitive story something children can appreciate i loved so much as a child i had to find it for my daughter it is definitely a movie i would watch with kids it reminds me a great deal of story's of a disney nature like <UNK> dragon and mary <UNK> both because of the live action and cartoon features but on its premise it is also a good story to show kids that if they tell the truth they can be trusted and adults will listen to them i think all kids should see it and would enjoy it it is such a break from the violent movies of bad taste so many kids watch these days it has all the charming qualities so many of today's movies don't have
<START> this is a 1972 disney movie for the time i was eleven years old and i thoroughly enjoyed this movie feeling nostalgic i purchased the three series dvd's of the <UNK> <UNK> movies and even now at age <UNK> i still enjoyed them it was all about fantasy magic and clean fun and it still is i wasn't sure which of the three movies came first then second and last so now i have the official dates on december <UNK> 1969 the computer wore <UNK> shoes on july 12 1972 now you see him now you don't on <UNK> 6 1975 the strongest man in the world i still think the middle movie was the best the special effects were amazing back in 1972 to us kids i definitely recommend it to all ages
<START> one of the better movies to come out of the 1980's this based on fact movie tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend leaves her naked body on a river bank and <UNK> about it later to his friends what is just as bad is their inability to feel anything about it br br disturbing but incredibly compelling look at <UNK> and <UNK> kids who have no respect for their parents or any sort of authority who seem almost doomed to live lives of rebellion and <UNK> this drama hits hard and is impossible to forget the young cast does a <UNK> job even keanu reeves in one of his earliest roles is better than usual of course there's no reason for the character of <UNK> glover to be as crazed and off the wall as he is but that's just glover being himself veteran dennis hopper has an especially good role as a loner who despite his own <UNK> past is <UNK> by the attitudes of this group of kids i would like to point out the chilling performance by daniel <UNK> as the young murderer he's an under rated actor and aside from hopper his is probably the best performance in the film br br i saw <UNK> edge for the first time a long time ago when it first started being shown on cable tv movie channels however i didn't catch all of it i saw it in its entirety for the first time a number of years later and now i've seen it again for what is probably the definitive time br br some <UNK> affecting moments include <UNK> <UNK> breakdown where she <UNK> that maybe she should leave her children just like their worthless father did i also liked the scenes where matt reeves faces off with his disturbed younger brother joshua miller and when the teacher mr jim <UNK> the fact that the girl has died and that none of his students seem to care br br i will never forget this film not as long as i live it's too <UNK> for that br br 10 10
<START> i have to hold my hand up and say that i was one of the first and probably the last to see this film where do i start it's a complete mess the main attraction of course was the soundtrack which goes without saying is brilliant it's what <UNK> does best but as they say don't give up your day job <UNK> definitely shouldn't br br acting is plain and simply awful even if the film had a plot the thing that <UNK> you most is why this man is up on screen and what the hell is doing there two words of advice to <UNK> give up acting and secondly use br br <UNK> has no screen presence no acting skills and the female lead looks just a little too young for him as for <UNK> just the same old bollywood <UNK> crap br br you can package the product as much as you want but if there's no substance it won't hold don't waste your money
<START> a lot of the films i've made probably could have worked just as well 50 years ago and that's just because i have a lot of old fashion values steven spielberg br br some points br br 1 though this film is a loose remake of a guy named joe it also borrows heavily from a matter of life and death and wings of desire br br 2 this was spielberg's second attempt at being frank <UNK> br br 3 spielberg has often said that he wishes to make a frank <UNK> movie in the vein of it's a wonderful life and mrs smith goes to washington judging from his recent attempts to get a harvey remake off the ground it seems as though spielberg still holds this dream the director rightfully not satisfied with his last 3 <UNK> into br br 4 critics at the time <UNK> always stating that the elaborate action sequences distracted from the film's romance but that's really not the problem at all the problem is that always needs a lot more special effects to distract us from the fact that spielberg can't film any line of dialogue that doesn't end in an <UNK> point br br 5 the film is filled with comedy that just doesn't work spielberg's comedic tastes aren't very sophisticated and seem to be ripped right out of 1950's <UNK> and looney tune cartoons these exaggerated antics may work in a cartoon universe but in a film it just seems like an odd marriage br br 6 the film's lead couple come across as brother and sister not lovers spielberg's films have always being <UNK> toward sex and <UNK> but this film goes to extreme <UNK> she's a <UNK> <UNK> and he's a <UNK> old man they're more irritating than endearing br br 7 the film contains one good scene in which john goodman <UNK> with holly hunter but for the most part the film's characters are too annoying there's no subtlety every emotion <UNK> every joke over designed every sequence filled with unnecessary br br 8 always and hook taught spielberg how to con audiences after their failure and the twin financial failures of the color purple and empire of the sun spielberg dumped the goofy colour cinematography of color purple and empire of the sun in favour for the more <UNK> black and white worlds of <UNK> list <UNK> minority report and saving private ryan from here on less light and dark cinematography became <UNK> with serious topics br br 9 after the financial success of each dark film spielberg <UNK> back to his colour cinematography and falls flat on his face once again <UNK> followed <UNK> list <UNK> followed ryan and lincoln will follow <UNK> these colour films are always <UNK> for being too tacky sentimental corny and hokey but the truth is if you removed the all these serious films would feel the same way br br 10 since the 70s spielberg has tried to <UNK> himself from the other brat pack directors scorsese de palma coppola etc by pretending to be an <UNK> and <UNK> he would himself state this repeatedly during many interviews in the late 70s the reality though is that he is probably the biggest <UNK> of all these directors the very form of his films often <UNK> their content their very box office performances always to their dazzling displays of carnage br br 11 the failure of spielberg to connect with any of the characters in always and the <UNK> he shows instead for filming forest fires air planes crashing etc perfectly <UNK> the rest of his filmography people running from dinosaurs sharks nazis <UNK> rocks etc this is what spielberg <UNK> in the moment his characters stop to speak however everything self <UNK> a film like <UNK> failed in other words because not enough blacks died and too many whites talked br br 12 the film's flying scenes aren't up to the set several years earlier in the mega hit top gun of course when your enemy is a forest fire it's hard to make things cinematic br br 13 failures like 1941 hook always etc are often more <UNK> that spielberg's more successful films they reveal the steel <UNK> beneath the technique they show what the amusement park ride looks like when its not working revealing the <UNK> beneath the broken <UNK> br br 5 10 ¬ñ there's one good sequence here two actors in a room simply <UNK> but this is mostly an annoying picture with a predictable script br br worth one viewing
<START> the <UNK> who wanted a king or <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> most <UNK> tale about people wanting government to solve their problems that i've ever seen the ironic thing is that they pray to the god <UNK> for their answers <UNK> responds first by sending a tree <UNK> and then a <UNK> neither works out and the <UNK> is especially dangerous to the creatures the <UNK> have some human qualities when we see them dress in the latest fashions of the day and we see some take pictures or use a movie camera when the <UNK> arrives like i said this short is very much a political allegory more suitable for adults than children in fact i first saw this on the <UNK> vhs that had <UNK> meets godzilla that alone should tell you what to expect here
<START> friday the 13th meets the matrix as with all of these stupid horror movies everyone knows who has been killed and who will be killed next but do nothing to prevent anything all with the added cgi action effects from the matrix hasn't the world seen enough matrix
<START> there are so many logical errors in this show it's barely worth me stating 1 <UNK> is non existent 2 is as powerful as <UNK> yet plays absolutely no role in the show somehow he is easily <UNK> by every bad guy 3 the whole super <UNK> 4 idea is retarded and it's appalling that he loses to super 17 which is the worst idea for a <UNK> villain ever 4 super <UNK> 4 <UNK> is no match for super 17 but non transformed <UNK> using a move he learned in a movie that wasn't supposed to happen kills him with ease 5 is utterly useless 6 no character other than <UNK> has any impact to the outcome of the battles 7 the series ends with a spirit bomb come on 8 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lame 9 better yet <UNK> <UNK> they both suck 10 super <UNK> 4 involves a magical transformation into an adult 11 <UNK> is a kid 12 <UNK> is a kid 13 no super <UNK> level 2 <UNK> by electricity 14 no imagination with the animation of 15 utterly useless 16 big bang is the biggest let down in anime history not really logical but i'm going off on a <UNK> 17 <UNK> character fights ever br br i could go on longer if i hadn't repressed the majority of memories associated with this show when i make enough money i am going to <UNK> the <UNK> of this series
<START> was a good film at the first i was wondering what is going on <UNK> <UNK> made out of mutant <UNK> which connected you and other players to a surreal virtual reality game via a <UNK> <UNK> well it seems a little odd br br but once it gets going its a pretty good film with a few twists with a great open ending and the good aspect of throughout the film is entertaining too see as your not sure whats coming next br br security <UNK> throw away the metal <UNK> they have bone guns
<START> i couldn't relate to this film i'm surprised that people are it for being so <UNK> how many people at your school were victim to incest how many closet homosexual <UNK> were there how many quiet people that you never noticed committed suicide hmmm ok you wouldn't know even if their were but really these are explosive problems which many us never deal with and yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems which could have been explored but hey where's the <UNK> in that br br with regards to the girl who committed suicide i found this to be exploitative i actually think many people in high school at some stage feel invisible ignored and <UNK> but what possesses someone to violently commit suicide on just another day of being ignored and <UNK> the filmmaker decided this girl would suicide to make the film more provocative and the graphic nature of the suicide to make it even more provocative i didn't buy it as a real life scenario br br and the problems of the other students i didn't fully relate to bullying is explored but that's been done to death we all know it goes on and it truly is a matter of resolve within that person closet homosexuality <UNK> another clich√© gets rolled out thats the thing really too many clich√©s i guessed the ending at the start there was a predictable <UNK> if that makes sense you've got all these characters with explosive problems and one with apparently none and i thought what is the point of this character unless she's the unsuspecting suicide victim and surely enough br br one thing i will say and it is the saving grace of the film is that it does not <UNK> suicide the suicide is very graphic and heart breaking to watch it is a powerful scene regardless of how contrived it is and one that <UNK> suicide as the easy option but the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes br br not bad but certainly not groundbreaking or worthy of a 17 minute standing <UNK> at cannes
<START> 1st watched 6 24 2007 4 out of 10 <UNK> <UNK> ok thriller but a little too predictable this story is based in germany which is also where the movie is made it is about a young medical student who gets a shot to go to a premiere school in <UNK> and arrives seeing some strange things occurring someone she met on the train there and saved shows up on the <UNK> <UNK> table and she's <UNK> foul play right away she does some investigation and the disappearance of her friend leads her to a secret society called <UNK> and no it's not <UNK> anonymous that has something to do with the anti <UNK> <UNK> and is used to perform on live people that doctor's wouldn't normally be able to do she finds out her grandfather who was a dean at the school was a big part of establishing it and it's pretty readily filled by members of the school it's an interesting story but the problem with this movie is how quickly the audience is told what's going on and then it's kind of a horror movie with the heroine fighting off the bad boy of the group that's taking things to the next psychotic level although this movie was made in europe it plays to a young american audience with it's focus on gore sex and the horror film premise which is really it's big downfall and explains why it probably made good money and <UNK> a sequel but doesn't necessarily make for a good movie
<START> i sell the dead is a big sloppy horror comedy that refuses to take itself too seriously this has <UNK> and <UNK> the 85 minutes of the film <UNK> by and the film is full of bits sometimes funny sometimes scary sometimes gory occasionally all three at once but the individual bits are much better than the sum of the film's parts br br the story such as it is follows professional grave <UNK> arthur blake played by dominic <UNK> <UNK> partner in crime willie larry <UNK> has just had his head chopped off for murder and arthur has one night left before his own head is <UNK> for the same crime arthur insists that he is innocent of murder but there are plenty of other crimes that he is willing to confess to when <UNK> with irish <UNK> by a catholic priest played by ron <UNK> br br since the movie is a series of grave robbing <UNK> <UNK> by arthur it becomes a sort of horror anthology a series of disjointed tales all linked by a similar cast arthur and willie and a similar theme grave robbing like most horror <UNK> there is no consistent mythology because all <UNK> are true and happening simultaneously even when they <UNK> one another br br it probably didn't help that i saw this film the same night as trick <UNK> treat a horror anthology that avoids all of the traps that i sell the dead falls into in fact trick <UNK> treat designed as an anthology tells a more <UNK> consistent story than i sell the dead which is intended to be a united narrative br br the other problem with the film and i recognize that this is insane <UNK> picking is the way the film plays fast and loose with history is killed with a <UNK> we might be able to stretch a point and say that he is killed by a scottish maiden a <UNK> to the french <UNK> but the scottish maiden was abandoned in and this film is set a good hundred years later since burke and <UNK> are mentioned and they were executed for murder in grave robbing as an industry became <UNK> with the passage of the <UNK> act <UNK> so the film must take place before then br br i know that bringing this up is the ultimate in historical <UNK> and we are clearly dealing with a universe where all sorts of dead undead and legendary dead are possible but the <UNK> way to anchor a fantasy to convince the audience to suspend their disbelief is to use something real and authentic to <UNK> the fantasy off of and it's not like the history of grave robbers or body <UNK> or call it what you like is a boring story br br the most frustrating thing is that writer director glenn clearly does know the history especially the good bits as an example when first takes on arthur as his apprentice he correctly explains to arthur that as they don't steal the clothes from the dead because stealing corpses is a <UNK> <UNK> by a small fine while stealing clothes is a <UNK> by <UNK> or possibly even death so you would expect and arthur to strip the corpse at this point and for the rest of the film but of course they don't you could <UNK> the director of ignoring his writer's script but not when the writer and the director are the same person br br my point isn't that there should have been a lot of buck naked corpses in the film my point is that if you are going to bring up this <UNK> in the law and make it clear that willie and arthur will follow the law no matter how silly it is than you do have to pursue that thought to its logical conclusion even if that means that willie and arthur wind up chasing a zombie through a graveyard trying to rip his or her clothes off and <UNK> them back in the empty coffin so that they don't get <UNK> for stealing the walking <UNK> clothes otherwise don't bring up the matter at all br br historical <UNK> aside i sell the dead is worth a rental as a slight but funny horror film that could have been much more
<START> all men are guilty says the chief of the police they're born innocent but it doesn't last add this bit of <UNK> to jean pierre <UNK> fascination with the idea of the code of honor and you have le <UNK> this code of honor among crooks however is not simply a clich√© it's a <UNK> of the imagination even when film realistic by their viewpoint romantic by most <UNK> began to make movies on the subject their theme is that it isn't what one does but how one does it we most often wind up with stories all about experienced men with their own sense of honor stories where fate <UNK> and the code run things br br for most of humanity except screen writers and movie directors this would seriously get in the way of living one's life raising one's children and being a good friend this mannered <UNK> is something of a self indulgent notion le <UNK> is in my view a classic film for people who may secretly enjoy the adventure of just missing the last bus home but where <UNK> le <UNK> <UNK> collection in my opinion is style <UNK> story le <UNK> manages the great trick of combining style with a strong story and with compelling actors the point of the movie in my view is nonsense but the movie itself is a first class experience br br <UNK> hopeless tale of three crooks <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> maria and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is based on a bit of wisdom which is maybe attributed to the <UNK> that all men who are destined to meet will along with their destiny they cannot change maybe because some believe <UNK> himself came up with the <UNK> if not the thought either way we know right at the start that this movie will not end happily will depend upon fate and coincidence to set things up for us and will leave us <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> we discovered and loved when we were in high school once corey and <UNK> meet and then gather in the unique talents of <UNK> we are off on a one way ride to rob an <UNK> heavily <UNK> jewelry story on the place the tension <UNK> because we not only know the french police are after <UNK> we also realize that some determined crooks are after corey br br the great pleasure of the movie for me came from <UNK> the work that <UNK> and <UNK> brought to their characters and the intelligent <UNK> that andre brought to his character the police captain mattei <UNK> hooked me as he developed these characters and their own situations he built me up emotionally and then released me when he brought me to appreciate their <UNK> fate and let me see see it happen <UNK> <UNK> his set pieces the escape from the train the escape from the woods the later shootout in the woods the <UNK> with mattei and a man who refuses to inform with intriguing possibilities he builds tension in all these cases by taking his time a rare <UNK> in movie making and an even <UNK> <UNK> now and <UNK> takes the time to build up mattei as an individual mattei is a <UNK> experienced man he's a loner he has a set routine when he returns to his apartment he <UNK> his three cats <UNK> he draws his bath and while the <UNK> is filling he sets out food for them i don't know who mattei is destined to meet but i hope it's someone who likes cats br br <UNK> is always <UNK> among some creative people and some critics in most cases i think it's a much harder task to set <UNK> aside and to simply live one's life without <UNK> too many people and that's even more challenging to show <UNK> in a film le <UNK> is a movie which for me tells me little but it is in its own way i think a beautifully put together film
<START> i won't <UNK> what so many others have said about this film i'll try to add a few new points the <UNK> as vampire bit is a nod to fans who are familiar with his turn on the <UNK> song no exit in which he assumes the role of a <UNK> vampire it actually works as a musical concept and is in fact a great song casper van <UNK> is no worse than brad pitt and is actually more handsome and really what does anyone go to a brad pitt movie for other than eye candy same here although this is poorly filmed check out starship troopers instead and of course <UNK> <UNK> after having played dracula in the <UNK> <UNK> film has little more than a cameo enjoy it if you can
<START> i had <UNK> high hopes for this david lynch whom i really like film but the very poor acting by everybody but <UNK> <UNK> was the first clue that this was a wasted effort some twin peaks characters are recycled into this film but it wasn't eerie it wasn't interesting except for the topless <UNK> scenes and the quirks were poorly executed br br i will probably give lynch one more chance but the hype around this film just doesn't pan out especially for those of us fans who saw <UNK> when it first came out
<START> 1st watched 3 17 2002 2 out of 10 <UNK> mario silly sex filled master slave having too many intimate relations movie this movie seemed to care more about the sex than the story and kind of worked the story around the sex laughable dubbing of the original italian language in the version i watched with ridiculous ending where the attempt is made to give an anti slave statement or should i say one line what a waste of time for everyone who watches this trash
<START> captivating tale of <UNK> behind the <UNK> the movie follows the plight of david <UNK> and jay leno as they struggle for the <UNK> tonight show spot <UNK> led by his desire for the <UNK> time <UNK> and leno led by his agent and little devil on the shoulder helen br br kathy bates is excellent in this movie <UNK> herself from such top dogs as bob wright warren <UNK> and howard <UNK> towards the end of the film you are so <UNK> with how she handles every situation from guest <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> that you find yourself wanting more br br john michael <UNK> <UNK> plays his part to the <UNK> at times i found myself wondering if he was any relation to the real <UNK> br br i highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of corporate <UNK>
<START> that's a weird weird movie and doesn't deserve a better mark than david lynch's one the special effects are badly made the actors are <UNK> bad actors and in this movie it's not about a race which is the minority of a planet and tries to fight against the but it seems to be a crazy movie which pays homage to <UNK> kind of <UNK> that's surely not the will of frank herbert the author of the six part epic check out david lynch's one that's the perfect tribute to the novels
<START> this movie is not a remake of she's all that 1999 br br where is the <UNK> of the american movie this was probably the worst movie i saw in the last 5 years this and the last movies of <UNK> br br
<START> it seems that no matter how many films are made on the subject there is no <UNK> of stories that emerge from the second world war it stands to reason that a conflict on such a scale as global <UNK> would capture the imagination of filmmakers everywhere and provide them with ample material on which to base a story heading in a different direction than most mainstream movies about the war is dark blue world a film that does not deal with the traditional major battles of the war does not tell the story of many of its major figures and does not even focus on soldiers of any of the major allied or <UNK> powers dark blue world instead <UNK> into the world of <UNK> soldiers fighting in <UNK> for their occupied nations br br the film does a marvelous job of portraying the challenges faced by czech pilots flying under the british royal air force expressing the frustration that they felt both at the language <UNK> between them and the other <UNK> but also at being restrained from achieving vengeance against the germans until being re trained br br dark blue world also works quite well outside the <UNK> of the war film as being a story about human relationships a love triangle develops between the two main characters and an english woman that <UNK> the teacher mentor relationship of the two <UNK> soldiers this relationship is extremely well acted throughout developing into almost a father and son relationship at many points br br the <UNK> combat in the film is among some of the best and is also very interesting in exploring the cultural challenges mentioned above as the men struggle to fly their machines fight the enemy and <UNK> <UNK> and replies in an unfamiliar language the tension and struggle of these scenes continues the tension between the men on the ground just as the tension on the ground continues that felt in the air br br this may not be a film for everyone the hardcore war film buff may find its exploration of relationships a bit off putting but it is on the whole an excellent film regardless of the <UNK> element or not
<START> when i first saw this film around 6 months ago i considered it interesting but little more but it stuck with me that interest grew and grew and i wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual vhs quality rather than the film itself i purchased the <UNK> dvd box set and it turns out that i was right the second time alexander <UNK> is a great film it is rousing and i'm sure it succeeded in its main aim propaganda against the germans br br that is the most common criticism against this film and against <UNK> that it is merely <UNK> and nothing else it's untrue he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived by now the world is far enough beyond joseph <UNK> to be able to watch <UNK> films as art
<START> this is easily the best cinematic version of william fiction that i've ever seen and i've seen several of the most prominent ones filmed in hometown of <UNK> <UNK> it really captures the feeling of <UNK> and county intruder in the dust is not one of best novel but even if it is a clich√© to say this it would be the crown jewel in any one else's career it beats <UNK> lee's good but simplistic to kill a <UNK> fifty feet into the ground i read that one in <UNK> grade and that's exactly where it belongs two of most prominent characters play major parts in the film <UNK> stevens and lucas stevens is probably the single most common character in all of fiction he's a lawyer and he works easily as a narrator because unlike many of his other characters stevens is a man of logic not emotion at least when he's older lucas may be the most prominent of all of black characters he plays a major part in one of out and out masterpieces go down <UNK> unlike all of the other black folks in he refuses to bow down to any white man he has pride and many in the white population find that an <UNK> quality in a black man one day lucas is found standing over a dead white man with a recently fired pistol in his possession most of <UNK> and the surrounding areas don't see the need for a trial and everyone's pretty sure that will be <UNK> before the <UNK> over or at least the next day as the murder and arrest occurred on a sunday on the other hand declares his innocence and tries to get stevens to help him stevens refuses the case seems open and shut but his young nephew chick because lucas had helped him in the past is willing to help him now br br as far as i know no hollywood film of this period deals with racism as overtly as this one hollywood films rarely <UNK> the black population but instead prefer to <UNK> them to servant roles if you're an african american actor you might as well give up and accept that role as either the <UNK> the maid the servant or the porter because that's the only way you'll work in intruder in the dust there is to be found one of the most memorable non porter roles a black actor ever had lucas and as i described above is no stereotypical character and might have been hard for audiences to accept even today black characters are usually simple magical and kind the recent <UNK> hit far from heaven is a great example of that is kind of a jerk and he's very stubborn although he's perhaps a little less so here than he is in the novel he's not any kind of stereotype he's a complex human being <UNK> plays extraordinarily well i haven't seen the film in a while but he also appears in robert 1955 film kiss me deadly as well as the cinematic adaptation of final novel the br br all the actors are great in the film i should also praise quickly claude <UNK> jr who has the great role of chick the novel takes place from his point of view and he is the conventional hero of the picture <UNK> is quite an actor he captures the character who also appears elsewhere in fiction <UNK> for example events that happened a decade or more before he was born in the 1957 novel the town perfectly he would appear in another great role the next year in the underrated john ford film <UNK> <UNK> the only other film of clarence <UNK> that i've seen is national <UNK> quite a different picture than intruder in the dust his job here is exceptional i really have to credit him with capturing <UNK> perfectly other famous <UNK> adaptations are too melodramatic the long hot summer filmed in 1958 which i really like despite that or too cold tomorrow filmed in 1972 which i do not like that <UNK> is a complete <UNK> of <UNK> the only other one that really does well according to its source material is douglas <UNK> great 1958 filming of <UNK> really a different sort of <UNK> novel altogether <UNK> angels 10 10
<START> i admit i was taken in by the provocative stills of charlotte lewis from this film as well as a comment on the imdb message board devoted to her calling this picture a great underrated film and so i got with great difficulty my own copy of <UNK> help br br what a waste br br nothing but a cheaply made blood and gore movie with a ridiculous premise which i'm not even going to repeat with several <UNK> sequences for instance when we see lewis lovingly feeding her fish we know right away what's going to happen to them later not even lewis with her beautiful <UNK> hair large and <UNK> brown eyes full and <UNK> lips and stunning figure can save this film lewis fans would be better off with bare <UNK> sketch artist or even golden child
<START> for a <UNK> leader normally the only guy trained and <UNK> for <UNK> in a <UNK> and very hard to replace to risk an expensive plane and himself to pick up a crashed fellow pilot no matter how close a friend he is in the face of <UNK> enemy troops is hard to believe especially when they both have to share a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> two into a ok but a spit come on this part of the film is a adventure not fitting a film that one is supposed to take seriously as said by s <UNK> <UNK> sweden is rubbish not at all one true story of the war comes to mind of two grounded spit pilots who planned and flew <UNK> a <UNK> mission over france one had to crash land and his friend landed his spit under fire while german <UNK> was moving in on them and flew them both out of there in a spit they were both severely injured in former fights one had an artificial leg from the <UNK> down now that may sound like something out of but it happened ill get sources if needed
<START> first of all the story is not so simple as many earlier reviewers tend to emphasize it is actually a very complex story unlike <UNK> other movies that are more bend towards character study in we have two main characters but as we are thrown from the start in the middle of a war we have no idea who is fighting and why everything is open for any resolution this creates a huge tension and makes every event meaningful as the story unfolds we are introduced to numerous characters that are turned into symbols of humanity both its dark and <UNK> sides we have the example of the innocent <UNK> who try to get by during an absurd war the cynical doctor who makes fun of his patients and provides the only bitter humor of the whole movie the perverse <UNK> who try to make the best of an atrocious event character the innocent dead children the <UNK> figures almost turned into animals from the boat etc all of them are somehow seen through the eyes of jan von <UNK> and eva their characters are more restrained then in other films en passion and this is exactly because what is important here is the story the way exterior events have the capacity to <UNK> change human nature br br bergman made this film two years after persona where the main conclusion expressed by the only word <UNK> by <UNK> character is nothing that's it the meaning of art and the meaning of life the latter being nothing more than a play that includes all plays but what about war and especially the ones of the century in persona the only real emotion suffered by character is when she sees a victim of the vietnam war turned into a human torch in that idea is extended to a complex analysis of the <UNK> nature of war in a <UNK> region of a <UNK> country we only assume it's two <UNK> speaking the same language fight an absurd war jan and eva are two <UNK> caught in the middle but their dreams are woven in a sort of <UNK> jan is at first an <UNK> unable to react properly to the world and a subject to his wife's will towards the end he turns into a <UNK> different personality capable of <UNK> murder strong <UNK> <UNK> watch carefully the <UNK> on the boat the simplicity of the act is harrowing on the other hand eva <UNK> <UNK> touch with reality and at the end she is completely <UNK> in her own <UNK> dream br br from a technical point of view the whole movie delivers its message in a very effective way bergman places the viewer alongside the character putting the camera in the car with the actors or in an extreme close up behind the actor <UNK> manages an extraordinary control of the camera there are some masterful hand held effects very good in making everything seem real the shots when the characters are captured by the army look remarkably documentary like the screenplay is <UNK> but the story is quite complex for that matter actually the whole movie is <UNK> it has an intensity in the subject that is in a sharp contrast to the <UNK> and lack of emotional involvement with which it is directed and filmed nothing is melodramatic here there is no compassion no hope and no apparent redemption but as in <UNK> dream at the end it is all so beautiful one cannot help but being amazed at it it was not so awful since it was so beautiful
<START> it's painfully obvious that the people who made this movie have never seen such brilliant spoofs as the naked gun and hot shots this movie is terrible and so are the actors they wouldn't know acting even if it hit them in the face as i felt like doing while watching this total pile of rubbish br br the movie is stupid and has no humor in it what so ever i'm sure that i could make a better movie with my friends to me it's amazing that a movie can fail this much not a single clever or funny line no trace of intelligence behind it it's a pathetic movie and i'd like to meet the person who actually likes this movie <UNK>
<START> i really thoroughly enjoyed this movie for one it didn't have the corny special effects that the big budget movies have the acting was decent in this one only you can tell right off the bat that it's dubbed but once you get over that fact and that you can't switch languages on the dvd version it's cool the plot line was very unique you take a situation like a heat wave very common around the world especially in <UNK> which i've been to many times and you take a garbage strike which happens often enough in this country and you have a recipe for disaster i loved how the <UNK> of rats just went everywhere and how the idea that if you picked up the garbage that's the last thing you wanna do you pick it up the rats don't get what the want they are in essence following the garbage pick up so you ask well if garbage men are on strike who picks up the garbage private <UNK> anyway military wants to <UNK> off the city <UNK> wrong thing to do then you would have all the rats take over the city then throw in a mayor who wants to keep a <UNK> on the budget and line her <UNK> you have a realistic movie and the female lead is also a pleasure to watch on the screen a very decent movie i thought wish more were made like this another small <UNK> is the depiction of <UNK> could have been done a little better but for the average viewer who's never been to <UNK> i was born in germany and been to <UNK> many times it won't matter but all in all a great big thumbs up
<START> spoilers ahead br br 15 park <UNK> my humble take on this film br br now for a viewer of cinema having tastes as severely limited as mine <UNK> films like 15 park <UNK> ought to be <UNK> to my sensibilities with this thought and a mild sense of embarrassment that i hadn't watched the complete film earlier i watched this film last saturday there are some starting similarities with other works like the legendary <UNK> drive david lynch from which this film borrows at least 3 concepts br br a that at least some truths are relative b the first scene of <UNK> and going around in a car as the opening credits roll is <UNK> similar to the car ride that betty and rita <UNK> in <UNK> drive in both cases the object of <UNK> happens to be a place which is probably mythical in both cases and perhaps more openly symbolic in film c the incident revolving around the mad <UNK> woman is again extremely reminiscent of the whole behind involving a bum but while that scary creature is an <UNK> of something and that that <UNK> as well as the character per se is <UNK> linked to other works of lynch notice carefully the <UNK> long hair the effect of the <UNK> woman in 15 <UNK> appears to be a tribute and therefore insignificant in the context of the film and its message br br the other films from which 15 <UNK> also borrows is blow up especially the last scene is a throw back to the truth vs perceived truth <UNK> presented towards the end of <UNK> masterpiece of course the professor and <UNK> angle also bring to the mind a beautiful mind although admittedly the subject here is high brow physics and <UNK> who <UNK> it inadvertently ends up being the brilliant <UNK> to the <UNK> hallucinations of character through those very <UNK> in an outstanding scene in the movie some of these elements are <UNK> with each other and that scene cuts back and forth from the <UNK> world of <UNK> where quantum physics and the theory of <UNK> justify the <UNK> and composition of the universe to the artificial of the <UNK> <UNK> world of but for all their differences the sisters are alike too both are incapable of <UNK> long lasting relationships one out of choice and the other out of nature so pain at being rejected in love by is in harmony with the inability of to form a special bond with either <UNK> or <UNK> but i'm getting ahead of myself viewers generally tend to view this film in one of the following two ways br br <UNK> 1 it was <UNK> all along there is a certain section of the audience who think so but that explanation is not only too far fetched but also contrived as that would mean she was dreaming up so many other characters too i e all those characters whom she <UNK> as <UNK> along with her br br <UNK> 2 there was a real and the ending is a metaphor this <UNK> says that the film's essence is <UNK> in one dialog in the film when in response to a statement by joy <UNK> that is looking for something that she will never find his wife <UNK> shah <UNK> that we all are looking indeed for that <UNK> <UNK> the end of the <UNK> <UNK> appears to lie the <UNK> of happiness and <UNK> br br there are other more minor possibilities which have not been <UNK> that much by our <UNK> audience like br br <UNK> 3 <UNK> and <UNK> are alter <UNK> of the same person <UNK> 4 <UNK> too is a <UNK> of imagination <UNK> 5 the old <UNK> perhaps mad <UNK> woman is the real protagonist of the story br br are these <UNK> worthy of even being tested well your guess is as good as mine br br why 15 park <UNK> contrary to the popular perception that she was thinking of the park <UNK> in ny i believe that she got the name from the brand name of a semi popular bathing soap remember her stating jo <UNK> profession as prime minister of which as you may be knowing is a popular <UNK> used in <UNK> the <UNK> is used as it was on <UNK> december that got engaged to and after his she remains forever in a time <UNK> the film has its fair share of flaws lack of use of a strong background score which in films like these can really <UNK> the narrative some sloppy dialogs by some forced dialog delivery inconsistent performances <UNK> and are excellent though imo by a few of the cast members albeit many members of this ensemble cast have been wasted <UNK> sudden <UNK> about her husband seems to be an <UNK> introduced dimension in the plot i give it 7 10 as it made me think but not any higher than that because i can easily <UNK> its sources of inspiration and having experienced and for the most part thoroughly enjoyed those previously i have already thought on similar lines earlier so the experience post 15 <UNK> is bound to be sans a certain degree of novelty where am i coming from i gave 9 5 10 to though rumors still <UNK> that one ray ghost directed it 7 5 to <UNK> 7 to <UNK> and mrs and 5 to on an existential level it failed to <UNK> my interest not even as much as say a <UNK>
<START> this was painful i made myself watch it until the end even though i had absolutely no interest in the plot if there was one my patience was not rewarded the ending was even worse than the rest of the film <UNK> walks into the hospital with a priest and his <UNK> says i do how vile can one movie be
<START> clive barker of <UNK> fame has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is funny and exciting br br the make up done by bob keen and geoffrey was fantastic it took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground it was really a treat to see the quality of work br br it wasn't particularly horrible as the worst creature was actually a human serial killer br br i just saw craig <UNK> in shadow of doubt the other day and he did a good job in this film also nothing spectacular but fair this was only anne <UNK> third film and she was good also br br the ending was spectacular and the <UNK> got their just <UNK> as did david <UNK> ha
<START> this groundbreaking film is truly a work of art i went into the screening at the convention in indiana with very low expectations having already viewed 2 other film with <UNK> in the title both of which were so bad that by the end of the second one i had <UNK> out one of my own eyes with my drinking straw and a twisted paper clip i found between the seat <UNK> but from the opening credits <UNK> had me the <UNK> setting made a beautiful backdrop for the drama surrounding the frustrated game master <UNK> <UNK> portrayed by nathan rice and his <UNK> band of friends who set aside the real life dramas they face everyday to face <UNK> dramas in the setting <UNK> provides for them after the first scene set in the fantasy world they inhabit they are violently thrust back into the world they so desperately try to escape this drew so many comparisons to my own life that i was moved to tears <UNK> acting is of such amazing caliber that i truly believed within the first 20 minutes of the film that he really was a twenty something male suffering from frustration male pattern <UNK> and an annoying group of friends that can't seem to grasp concepts like right and wrong friends are of some note here leo the oldest and <UNK> of the trio seems to be the only other character with a job aside from <UNK> yet he seems to <UNK> socially towards gary the youngest of the group this seems only slightly odd at first until you realize that gary is in fact a sexually confused <UNK> with very few <UNK> outside his fantasy world this <UNK> serves not to confuse but to inform and <UNK> the audience about the importance of diversity in our society my only complaint about this is that the actors who portray leo scott c brown and gary christian doyle seem to play the characters for laughs at times as though they were informed they were acting in a comedy instead of a hard hitting action drama speaking of action brian lewis makes his film debut as <UNK> the third and most influential member of <UNK> crew the tension is always high when he is on screen both when he is arguing <UNK> about his beliefs to <UNK> or when displaying his fantastic martial arts skills as silence his fantasy character or even when he turns around suddenly to face the audience and you duck in the audience so as not to get <UNK> by his fantastic <UNK> lewis lights up the screen no matter what he's doing and i hope to see more of him in the future once the action begins in this movie it just doesn't quit the drama and the action blend so <UNK> at times that you tell whether your in the middle of a frenetic action sequence or a touching dramatic moment truly a thrill ride of epic proportions i would recommend the <UNK> <UNK> rising as required viewing for anyone who loves film it was almost worth losing an eye over br br chip
<START> warning miserable movie warning the day before christmas eve some nut case decided he'd entertain us by sending this movie as on tv what in gods name was he thinking br br this movie is filled with awful humor despicable acting lousy jokes and a disaster of a plot line randy quaid plays the idiotic role as cousin eddie johnson eddie is a brain dead person who's incapable of even the <UNK> tasks he was fired because he was dumb as a brick but the company he worked for was sorry for it so they sent him and his family on a vacation but being as stupid as he is he managed to make the vacation into a disaster br br all in all it's the worst movie i've seen and i have nightmares still over the miserable acting and the even more miserable jokes in this movie it's so sad you almost have to see it but don't the nightmares i have are far worse than any other nightmares you will ever have trust me i hate this movie so bad because of it's acting the humor the jokes and the story the only good thing was the nice scenery br br well it's my opinion and i surely hope everyone agrees with me

<START> in following dylan <UNK> star from the charming <UNK> <UNK> owner in the <UNK> sitcom black books i could see his comic potential begging to be <UNK> in theater or larger cinematic <UNK> this first big screen outing in a starring role he had a cameo as <UNK> the thief in <UNK> hill had <UNK> of promise but like the strained steve <UNK> vehicle the <UNK> officer has too many which should have been <UNK> out in <UNK> br br the plot is so convoluted that i <UNK> bother repeating the <UNK> details the script has every character do that for us and the laughs are <UNK> from show business in jokes michael caine is a pompous has been running a production of richard iii updated to nazi <UNK> one of the few genuine laughs a satirical <UNK> at ian <UNK> in which everyone is forever doing the hitler <UNK> every time they take the stage convincing dylan that acting should be a <UNK> act <UNK> itself the two plot to steal money from some fairly harmless gangsters by way of their acting <UNK> confusion ensues both on screen and in the audience there's a romantic sub plot between dylan and the daughter of one of the gangsters blah blah blah and dylan gets to dress in odd clothes and do funny accents michael caine delivers some choice lines and <UNK> comic timing is on the money so why isn't it any good it does have a certain charm that you would expect from film 4 but it also has a <UNK> little girl acting as <UNK> in a muddled and irrelevant plot a no no in screen writing 101 exposition <UNK> everything else you just want to see <UNK> and caine acting as comic foil to each other the way the were at the beginning but when they're together toward the end the the pairing has lost its charisma br br the actors is an amusing albeit <UNK> effort should it come on telly during a rainy <UNK> afternoon then have at you otherwise you would be better off watching your old black books videos or renting <UNK> i

<START> at one time buddy <UNK> movies ruled the box office it seemed that every summer <UNK> of beverly hills cop <UNK> <UNK> on our <UNK> theaters not any more lately the <UNK> has <UNK> to barely a <UNK> the <UNK> has <UNK> a bit recently with the release of showtime a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genre br br mitch preston is a dedicated cop he's not a dirty harry type by any means he's just incredibly focused professional who's completely <UNK> of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his say a t v cameraman mitch deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way and so falls into the <UNK> of chase a producer looking for a killer hook for her reality t v ' cop show she thinks that mitch will give her the boost it needs to be a hit but feels he may be too unlikable to carry the whole show by himself enter <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> actor who's watched way too many police story re runs of course mitch and <UNK> mix like oil and water and much merry mayhem ensues br br we know that mitch and <UNK> are bound to become best buddies by the end of the movie that's the way buddy cop movies are suppose to work in fact it has to be said that showtime rarely <UNK> from the time <UNK> clich√©s as <UNK> by lethal weapon and tango cash there's a high tech <UNK> to get the ball rolling in this case an automatic rifle that fires rounds big enough to stop tanks there's a slick foreign <UNK> with an accent of <UNK> origin there are chases <UNK> and explosions we all know this going in and we have a pretty fair idea how it's all going to turn out you know what there's nothing wrong with that yes we know the well worn <UNK> are going to be touched but the fun here is the trip not the destination showtime doesn't strain to be original instead its <UNK> are <UNK> into its characters and humorous situations as a result showtime does a competent job with the action sequences but really shines in its comedy br br robert de niro is <UNK> funny as mitch in the past i've thought de niro to be a cold and actor given horribly to <UNK> when called upon to do comedy lately though he's grown on me he seems to be <UNK> more humanity into his roles eddie murphy is hilarious as <UNK> the best way to describe his performance is that <UNK> is what murphy would be if murphy weren't so talented and hadn't hit the big time <UNK> russo has a <UNK> time playing <UNK> mouthed show <UNK> shark chase she stalks through the movie chasing high <UNK> ratings with awe inspiring determination in her <UNK> she re <UNK> <UNK> life to make it more camera friendly she even calls upon t j hooker himself william shatner to show mitch how be a more cop shatner is funny playing himself precisely as we expect him to be loud oblivious and slightly obnoxious br br i have to admit i was really looking forward to showtime and i wasn't disappointed ten years ago this movie would have been a guaranteed hit today it's doing <UNK> business at best that's a pity because showtime is a whole lot of fun
<START> i've been hearing a lot of this new bird <UNK> that has killed dozens of people in south east asia over the last three years apparently it's on the hold of <UNK> into something very <UNK> and millions upon millions of people are going to be wiped out in a global <UNK> just thought i'd mention this in case you haven't got round to writing your will yet br br i'd also thought i'd mention it since i was watching something called <UNK> tonight which wasn't about naval <UNK> but opens with a scene that's a cross between <UNK> and an episode of the x files i saw many years ago i thought i'd be watching something with added <UNK> after hearing the stories about the danger <UNK> by bird <UNK> but after the not unimpressive opening <UNK> <UNK> into a cheap and cheerful <UNK> and like every other <UNK> you'll see the lead characters are female one of which is a <UNK> authority figure while the other lead female is a mother of young children it goes without saying there's a sick child subplot too br br what is irritating about the <UNK> format is that it <UNK> the potential of what could have been quite a good film if it was made for cinema there's a fairly gory scene of someone <UNK> blood all over a <UNK> face and a very impressive jay walker getting run down stunt but these bits are quickly forgotten as the mood <UNK> into family sentiment since this and just about every other <UNK> ever made was made for an essentially female audience
<START> this is a beautiful yet simple movie about one man driven to find an answer an answer he doesn't necessarily need but has structured his whole life around it is <UNK> it is hilarious it is glorious it is <UNK> it is delicate and dynamic i say it's genius br br i have read jonathan <UNK> book everything is <UNK> mainly because i heard <UNK> wood was starring in the movie adaptation and i was just <UNK> by the characters i laughed out loud more than once and every time someone talks about what it's about i hear the same hackneyed response almost like it's one big long word yet this story is so philosophical it goes deeper than that that conversation about the ring and in case it really gets one thinking suddenly this story <UNK> from a simple quest to an inner <UNK> and i find myself looking at things a bit differently now br br i recommend renting this before if ever reading it because the book had many obscene downright perverted stories that were not included in the movie mainly the history of <UNK> family that was not necessary for the film br br a bit of trivia i heard is that <UNK> current girlfriend has a cameo in this flick as the drummer in the band that alex <UNK> to perform as jonathan steps off the train into <UNK> br br you spend half of the movie trying to figure out what it's about exactly and what jonathan is about because his character is so <UNK> like a turtle in a shell br br it is magnificent and in my opinion one of <UNK> <UNK> best movies
<START> little quentin seems to have <UNK> the art of having the cake and eating it br br as usual the pure sadistic display can be explained as a clever thought provoking way of sending violence back into the audience's face br br sure mr tarantino violence is <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> it is well worth <UNK> in it to make that point how very brilliant br br the juvenile part of the audience may well not be clever enough to follow all the smart references to higher levels of consciousness though but i'm confident they'll see the light one day br br thanks for making this little world of <UNK> a little better you deserve a <UNK>
<START> steven segal has done some awful films but this is probably one of the best since his career took a dive about ten years ago the cast is better than usual and while the story and the plot are a total joke at least most of the action scenes look pretty good br br the plot is probably one of the worst in film history someone is being executed because he stole some money some <UNK> types kidnap a supreme court justice their goal is to exchange the judge for the prisoner so they can find out where he has the money meanwhile the execution chamber is full of trap doors and false floors and looks like a set from one of the du <UNK> circus shows br br then there is the issue of the prison here the warden is a played by tony <UNK> the prisoners all have their gang colors and signs and the guards are there to serve the <UNK> and keep the prison clean nothing like a bunch of prisoners fighting and beating up some guards while the warden is watching what happens the warden gives them a stern talking to he might <UNK> them next time br br there are a lot of moments in this movie that are good for laughs however <UNK> looks pretty good and <UNK> rule tries to be an action hero lots of fun watching the prisoners all do the right thing and get armed so that they can free the supreme court justice from her <UNK> regardless of how bad half past dead may be when you watch it keep in mind that it is easily the best movie that steven segal has starred in since under siege in 1992
<START> the most beautiful film if one is looking for serious depth meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie excellent performances by the whole cast even more beautiful than a beautiful mind itself simply awesome i wish this movie entered the oscars i cried through the whole movie for the <UNK> character the most beautiful film if one is looking for serious depth meaning and excellent performance then you have to get to watch this movie excellent performances by the whole cast even more beautiful than a beautiful mind itself simply awesome i wish this movie entered the oscars i cried through the whole movie for the <UNK> character
<START> i gave this movie a four star rating for a few reasons first i felt that this movie was definitely preaching and i hate that still it's my own fault for watching a christian movie in the first place br br my friend and i rented this movie because it sounded interesting the back of the case said something along the lines of a spiritual battle someone opening some sort of <UNK> that let demons into our world and the like something i am very interested in indeed this movie almost hit the target it was more like on the edge of the target more on the tree than the target itself br br the basic plot of this movie is two couples are <UNK> by a group of terrorists to be victim to experiments however because their experimental serum is derived from the research of a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual <UNK> the men of the couples are now able to feel smell hear and see the demons of the spiritual world in that order apparently the sense of taste is not present in that realm br br this movie is very clich√©d they took the title seriously as the men while <UNK> to the <UNK> demand their women look behind them because there is something there br br although a good effort for what it was i think the special effects could have been done so much better the demon scratching at the woman was in a word hilarious the wife was obnoxious as hell and everyone in the room practically <UNK> when she died we were all hoping she'd be beaten by the other woman with the chair though br br the message is one that i don't care to comment on other than i think the christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it br br and so i give it four stars because it is not the movie's fault i am not a christian and don't like this type of message and i got a kick out of making comments throughout my friend and i watching this movie seemed to resemble an episode of mst3k
<START> michael jackson's thriller 1983 has to be the greatest video ever made dude you have zombies gore and a catchy tune what more can you ask for john <UNK> mixed elements from night of the living dead and american werewolf in london and out came this video what starts out as a nice evening for a young couple turns into a date from hell literally you have dancing zombies a werewolf in a funky jacket and vincent price <UNK> a cool video to a song that everybody in the neighborhood marked out to br br i have to give this one a high recommendation because it has to be the best music video ever made there hasn't been another one like it br br check out the making of thriller the documentary has some interesting stuff in it
<START> the film starts out with a narration of the protagonist explaining certain crimes occurring all over the city and then we get to know that the hero is a cop who is either suspended or has probably retired i did not have the patience or the interest to <UNK> the above before commenting if there is a stereotype for <UNK> to have a deep sleep inducing voice then it is high time to put an end to it i seriously fell asleep and did not bother to shut the movie down either am still trying to figure out what the movie was all about and why there were no <UNK> shootings a third rate tv serial will have more number of sets compared to this crap of a movie and i still pity the actors and producers involved in this huge <UNK> of a movie it ought to have been produced as a normal tv serial or maybe even as a local theater drama instead of putting it out on the big screen total waste of time and money the movie was supposed to be in production for a long time and it would have been better to have left it that way with redundant sleep inducing dialogs and sets this is the worst movie i have come across
<START> ok ill be brief this film wasn't just bad it was very very bad with like if you deal with the devil you expect to get sh t on your shoes you know your in hideous film territory after watching this film i wanted to kill myself and my entire family it gave me such a vast feeling of self loathing i wanted to do murder don't watch this film i will kill again but when i do it will be terribly edited with a pathetic soundtrack and stock shot for hire action sequences and bad shirts br br fortunately there is a <UNK> its the first action film to feature a three door ford <UNK> br br unfortunately it ends up <UNK> on its roof br br ps worse than the <UNK>
<START> fred the hammer <UNK> delivers another cheaply made movie he might have set a new standard for himself look for the painfully obvious special effects <UNK> cannon that is visible in the street during a chase scene you don't see it just once you see it several times look for the out of focus shot in one scene and the camera <UNK> try to fix it as the scene rolls on watch this with a group of people and make your own mystery science theater
<START> when dubbed into another language let's face it neither <UNK> nor <UNK> are really good actors when it comes to dialog and given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a loose loose situation any type of voice over is sure to be an improvement and it actually is at least in the german version br br but that is only a minor point the acting is bad the <UNK> up combat sequences are pathetic <UNK> couldn't use her sword to fight her way out of a wet paper bag this becomes painfully obvious when compared to the <UNK> of motion <UNK> by the kid who has had some martial arts training no doubt and to the <UNK> shown off by bergman br br <UNK> does his conan thing nothing new here br br some of the visuals are nice i'll have to grant that the dragon <UNK> bridge looks cool but more often than not the <UNK> is all too evident br br overall the movie isn't worth seeing even the is better than this although only <UNK> i would have much rather seen bergman as red <UNK> as she was originally supposed to be but i doubt that that could have saved this movie oh well br br 3 10
<START> in some scenes in the rain people francis ford <UNK> <UNK> to his hey day of the seventies there is the mark of a similar situation to <UNK> easy rider but not exactly in the same reference frame here we have a drama about <UNK> people from society in some ways <UNK> by the choices or by limits <UNK> by one mean or another it's one of those rare original dramas where some scenes stand alone as total <UNK> even with such a low string budget and a very <UNK> so to speak attitude about filming the movie coppola is able to capture everything that needs to be said through these clearly defined characters and the <UNK> unexpected degrees of one character versus the <UNK> of another or vice versa or both and as one might be inclined seeing as how it is very much about the <UNK> of suburban life of the 1960s it has that <UNK> of the film mentioned before but of a more <UNK> near timeless quality with the drama and the underlying issues in a way if bergman were on route as a quasi <UNK> 20 something filmmaker out to get the strange truths of everyday <UNK> this might be it br br but along with all of the very direct and sometimes self conscious photography though also with a more documentary approach at times akin with its characters the actors all fit into place shirley knight an actress i'm not too familiar with has a complex role as a pregnant wife running off in a sort of <UNK> <UNK> of what life is there to have there are moments of some awe inspiring acting by her and one of my favorites if not my favorite is when she is on the <UNK> calling her husband the first time such a tense scene on both ends and in every small gesture and <UNK> of a word so much about her is spoken with so little it's extraordinary in ways that mirror others in <UNK> films then comes in the character of <UNK> played by james <UNK> this too is a dangerous character to take on as it is a mix of childish <UNK> and amusement with <UNK> memories think forrest <UNK> if he didn't make it past the football and wit it's one of his best actually by being the most <UNK> for a guy who's usually playing tough guys in movies here's one that also is part of the <UNK> of the story and of <UNK> character also very good in a supporting role is robert duvall as a cop with a rough side and rather <UNK> past kind of an early <UNK> of other <UNK> characters he would play later on in his career br br so the characters and what coppola risks in having an <UNK> running in them are really what make up the film as whatever story there is it is definitely not resolved in the usual way you might think or expect the last ten or so minutes are like others in <UNK> work where the specific <UNK> on all sides are <UNK> by the emotional and psychological <UNK> this will leave on the principles are <UNK> to the sublime and sad this is for its time brave on the part of what is trying to be represented in both the freedom as well as the flaws and <UNK> in the subject matter and the style of the picture adds a <UNK> kind of view onto it all with quick flashbacks that are graphic and self contained in a contrast with the longer shots in some crucial scenes it's a road movie of its period but its also got a lot more working than it would under another filmmaker with less chances to take on the nature of these <UNK> characters one of the best films of 1969
<START> another period piece for <UNK> can't remember him doing a modern film br br good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises none of the hk fighting scenes or the hollywood type of heroes but it is good because of it the characters are strong i really felt for them br br understanding the <UNK> definitely gives the english subtitles the edge the film is 3 hours but it didn't feel like it
<START> this movie contains real animals been killed like a monkey been eaten by a snake and an been cut open i find this totally deranged and sick and seriously question the mental health of the director of this trash br br this movie is so stupid and <UNK> that it has no logic at all br br there is a lot of boobs and sex in this movie still don't bother viewing this trash for that if you want to see boobs and sex watch a porno instead there is also rape scenes in this movie which i found disgusting like women been raped and cut up and eaten this movie is for <UNK> and those who get their kicks seeing people been cut up and eaten br br a lot of the animals like the monkey that appeared in this movie there is none in the <UNK> of new guinea the local characters most of them appeared to be asian and none look like they come from new guinea it looks like this movie was made around the grounds of a resort which i bet it was br br stay away from this trash its sick and deranged
<START> wow as soon as i saw this movie's cover i immediately wanted to watch it because it looked so bad sometimes i watch bollywood movies just because they're so bad that it will be entertaining <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> this movie had all the elements of an atrocious film a gang of local thugs that is completely harmless a poorly done motorcycle scene horrible <UNK> <UNK> son i am very proud that you are a bad boy actors playing basketball as if they are good atrocious songs me bad me bad me bad bad boy unexplained plot lines like why are the good boy and bad boy friends and why is the hot girl in love with the nerd i've never seen such a poorly constructed story with such horrible directly some of the scenes actually took 30 seconds long like the one where the good and bad boys inexplicably ran over the gang <UNK> poker game <UNK> you are a bad director if you want to watch a good movie watch guru if you want to watch a movie so bad that it's actually entertaining then watch good boy boy
<START> ridiculous film where two swinging college <UNK> move out to california and one becomes a movie star and the other his manager br br as 10 years pass the <UNK> popularity is so it is determined that there will be a television show where women will compete for his affection br br the film is obnoxious and ridiculous the girls who <UNK> for lover boy are made to look foolish only one girl seems to be the choice of the producer of the show she is really an amateur up against some of the other women but she is wholesome and brings good ratings to the show as well br br by the third scene you realize that the manager is falling for her br br we know that ryan really was meant to be a bachelor while the ending is somewhat cute you really know where this was going
<START> i thoroughly enjoyed this film when it was first released and on each occasion i've seen it since the political drama is effective if not especially new or inspired the decades since the release of the film have demonstrated that the <UNK> to cut costs at the expense of public safety is definitely not just something imagined by a screenwriter br br however i think the most impressive element of this film is jack <UNK> performance it is absolutely astonishing to watch him at work he has the gift to be able to communicate so much at times without saying a word next time you watch this film check out jack's face at the times he is not saying anything he does not need to speak or worse yet to <UNK> to let you know what's going through his mind br br i am calling this a spoiler because of the impression it made on me when i first saw the film in <UNK> last scene in the film as he is lying on the floor he feels a slight <UNK> the terror in his eyes is one of the most frightening images i have seen in any film it is perfect acting because it conveys instantly the threat about to occur if jack's character is so terrified there is certainly something awful about to happen and it does
<START> imagine if you took the christ myth mixed it with a healthy dose of porn against a backdrop of bad sci fi from another planet like throw in a dash of after school special and lots of really bad kung fu fighting oh and some decent break dancing with an awesome <UNK> keyboard soundtrack br br and some how they make this even worse than you could imagine there are at least 4 rape scenes at least one great car explosion a buff black guy running around in his <UNK> with an <UNK> br br add alcohol and this is the perfect movie br br i mean lots and lots and lots of alcohol
<START> barney is that idiot dinosaur who didn't go <UNK> with the other dinosaurs many <UNK> ago instead he sings stupid songs and has stupid morals about life that are 100 worthless and or extremely dangerous that is strangers are your friends you haven't met yet the reason why i say he's evil well on youtube there's a video of a barney song about toy balls when it's played backwards it comes out as we'll all come hang you let's stab the <UNK> don't believe me see it for yourself i also read on another review that they are now reading out pc <UNK> and fairy tales now that is just stupid with a capital s i mean really anyways i don't recommend letting your kids watch this filth as it contains stupid morals like strangers are your friends as said before there is never a reason to be sad and if you are sad eat junk food being an individual is taboo magic can solve all of your problems and <UNK> of other ridiculous crap
<START> dark and bleak sets thrilling music that cuts through your spin like or razor a perfect cast lead by broadway <UNK> and lansbury this is exciting theatre <UNK> transferred to the small screen <UNK> is the most talented <UNK> of our age and todd is his masterpiece from the <UNK> opening <UNK> to the darkly humorous act i finale a little priest where <UNK> and todd <UNK> about the victims that will wind up in their meat <UNK> this play never <UNK> to thrill <UNK> and satisfy <UNK> <UNK> also excels as <UNK> even she as the plays <UNK> seems slightly mad edmund turns in a <UNK> performance as the corrupt judge who <UNK> after <UNK> and is the subject of <UNK> <UNK> lansbury and command the show as only two great actor stars can do other musical highlights include <UNK> <UNK> worst <UNK> in london and the act ii opening thats good and that is a title to describe this production
<START> not too bad entry in the series heavily with war propaganda but <UNK> <UNK> sincerity keep me happy br br it's a rather fantastic story from start to finish just how many are there holmes and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out the dancing men code so fast was amazing watson so why weren't you amazed the post explaining the bomb sight <UNK> me it was just the kind of cheap trick universal would play once again reminding me that they didn't expect people to be <UNK> watching this over 60 years later this and i think every other <UNK> from universal at this period were meant to be viewed the once or twice and forgotten they perhaps should have realised that basically people don't change that what was entertaining to ordinary people in 1942 would still entertain a <UNK> group now 2005 and <UNK> up on the script and sets br br lionel <UNK> was going through his hollywood rape court case at about this time i wonder if it was that or particularly effective make up that made him look so <UNK> as <UNK> br br the important thing about <UNK> though is that this was the first holmes film roy william <UNK> directed i think he directed all of the rest and produced all but one thus establishing a marvellous <UNK> continuity
<START> this is a absolutely masterful stroke of genius by paul thomas anderson the writer director of this movie it really <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> of the world of porn and consequences for your actions living in a world literally <UNK> by sex drugs and rock <UNK> roll only of the finest casts assembled with mark <UNK> burt reynolds heather graham <UNK> moore william h macy philip seymour hoffman don cheadle philip baker hall and others
<START> my wife and kids was billed as the <UNK> very own <UNK> show but unlike the latter it was unfunny and unwatchable in fact it is so poorly written and some of the jokes <UNK> around michael mickey taking michael <UNK> <UNK> and the fact that he is such a loser which got more and more tedious and annoying as the show went on br br what was supposed to have been a promising hit eventually turned into a dumb silly show later on where the ideas became so <UNK> and ridiculous and as for the second claire i ended up <UNK> this character so much she became a <UNK> childish and <UNK> teenage brat in most of the later episodes br br was no <UNK> show trend <UNK> rather it was just a poor black sitcom by general standards
<START> this is a pretty faithful adaptation of novel black rain like the book it is very moving and thought provoking the story revolves around a <UNK> attempts to see their niece successfully married they are having trouble finding <UNK> because of a <UNK> that she suffers from radiation sickness after walking through <UNK> on the day of the bombing well filmed well acted moving tragic horrifying and funny
<START> i'm like the rest of the fans who love this comedy i've been waiting for it on dvd i've got it on vhs and got so fed up waiting for a release and worrying that my vhs copy would ruin i got the equipment to get it onto dvd the picture and sound are excellent to my utter surprise if anyone else <UNK> a copy drop me a line at br br stone <UNK> <UNK> co uk br br and for <UNK> 00 i'll put it onto a dvd print the dvd and get it in the post to you <UNK> 00 just covers my costs recorded delivery etc with maybe a little over so i'm not after making money out of it i'd just like the world to see this ignored gem of a comedy i recently saw a copy of ebay got for over amazing how can they not release this classic email me for <UNK> details like <UNK> or <UNK> etc etc
<START> a bad movie about a bad movie is that original or what if it is then that's the only good thing about it the lovely ally <UNK> couldn't stop this bomb from destroying movie theaters and <UNK> everywhere it should also be noted that she and the other actors hired by danny <UNK> character were billed as themselves as well as the characters they played in his d rated film calling it a b rated film is too much of a compliment and would lead to <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> this review is long <UNK> since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made i'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting post production editing directing or any other aspect of film making it's practically perfect in all of them ¬ñ a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces br br the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema i can think of no other film where something important occurs every other minute quite literally <UNK> kim seems to have made a movie that practically <UNK> the viewer to <UNK> it on the most detailed of levels a seemingly insignificant object may be shown ¬ñ a rack of dresses two <UNK> a drop of blood <UNK> from a floor crack a bottle of <UNK> etc ¬ñ but upon <UNK> <UNK> turns out to be so much more ¬ñ a clue that helps to make sense of that particular scene or perhaps the movie in total which almost always contributes a stirring reflection upon the psychological concepts that <UNK> in the background until the viewer's intelligence <UNK> them to spring to the <UNK> such an event might occur a handful of times during any other movie but in a tale of two sisters such events occur in such a rapid fire relentless fashion that the viewer must watch the film in a <UNK> state of <UNK> they miss something important in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this it's quite simply the highest most <UNK> form of cinema imaginable br br the most <UNK> <UNK> criticism of a tale of two sisters is nicely <UNK> by <UNK> b <UNK> who <UNK> claims that the story is an incoherent <UNK> mess that uses confusion to <UNK> a false sense of intelligence because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions he <UNK> that <UNK> kim tossed up a dozen possible explanations and left it at that in reality however nothing could be further from the truth a tale of two sisters provides a series of objective facts that help the viewer to identify the exact <UNK> of each and every scene of the film if our good friend <UNK> had been paying attention he would have noticed ¬ñ for example ¬ñ the series of obvious flashbacks which provide enough factual information to make sense of the film these flashbacks convincingly <UNK> <UNK> of complete <UNK> the objective elements of a tale of two sisters are so obvious to anyone willing to see them that the mere <UNK> of a lack of <UNK> can only call into question the patience of a viewer who apparently does not want to put forth even the slightest effort whatsoever to see them can <UNK> kim really be <UNK> for the <UNK> of viewers who lack the desire to understand his film i think not br br please note that i will not insult the intelligence of critics such as <UNK> that cannot get a tale of two sisters because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence as much as a lack of <UNK> the movie spells itself out so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is a lack of effort on the part of the viewer yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzle solving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture you need only put them together remember the screenplay was written by someone with the picture already in mind ¬ñ he simply separated the pieces and placed them <UNK> throughout for the purpose of providing a magnificent cerebral exercise that ¬ñ when completed ¬ñ an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe br br don't <UNK> me there are films that seem to start with an <UNK> picture and try to create a puzzle that is <UNK> by design spider forest 2004 perfect blue 1998 and <UNK> <UNK> 2001 are perfect examples of this a tale of two sisters is not it's ironic that <UNK> claims <UNK> to be more masterfully constructed than a tale of two sisters especially considering that <UNK> not only provides almost no objective facts but also a twist ending that is the quintessential <UNK> ex <UNK> clich√© that could be dropped at the end of any movie ever made in order to provide the ultimate in faux intelligence i'm ashamed of myself for mentioning the two films in the same sentence but the contrast is an important one although it does <UNK> me that <UNK> would <UNK> a movie that <UNK> when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort as a way of <UNK> a film that only becomes discernible thru a significant <UNK> of intellectual effort he apparently likes his intelligent films in the most superficial form possible this is evident when he makes 17 <UNK> questions in his review that are answered quite convincingly by the film itself just read the threads by within the imdb a tale of two sisters discussion forum anyone who carefully reads those threads and still <UNK> a lack of an objective solution to this film may as well stop watching intelligent films altogether because the answers are so damned obvious br br i'd like to say more but i've come to my 1 000 word limit all that has been said here needed to be said so be it now said
<START> i have watched this movie at least 30 times maybe more and each time i watch it i am drawn into the movie and back to 1963 the movie takes me on a nostalgic vacation every time i watch it br br i think the important thing to say here is i was 15 in 1963 and i can remember before president kennedy was shot and before the <UNK> came i can feel myself saying something like i carried a <UNK> and then realizing just how stupid that was jennifer grey plays frances baby <UNK> in dirty dancing baby is going to start college in the fall she goes to for vacation with her family mom dad and sister lisa br br one of the staff dancers penny played by <UNK> <UNK> gets pregnant by another staff person one of the college boys played by max <UNK> and has a chance to get an abortion but it is on a night that her and johnny patrick <UNK> are <UNK> to dance at a nearby hotel br br thus the need for a fill in dancer for penny johnny is <UNK> by penny and his cousin billy <UNK> jones that he can teach baby to do the dance in time for the show baby learning the dance steps with penny and johnny are wonderful scenes br br <UNK> father doctor jake <UNK> played by jerry <UNK> comes to <UNK> rescue when the abortion is done wrong dirty dancing brought back to me this time in history when girls got pregnant and had <UNK> in back rooms by <UNK> around this time 1963 many girls actually died from this type of abortion but there were not many choices for a girl then br br <UNK> price plays a great <UNK> <UNK> neil <UNK> to jack <UNK> max <UNK> jane does a great job as <UNK> annoying sister lisa <UNK> br br the music is great and the dancing is wonderful the dirty dancers are absolutely wonderful and very sexy i can feel <UNK> <UNK> when she first sees them dancing and says <UNK> they learn to do that br br jennifer grey and patrick <UNK> are just perfect together in their respective roles <UNK> song she's like the wind brings tears to my eyes each time i hear watch it in this movie br br the movie ends on an up note but leaves you wanting to know what happens next in <UNK> and <UNK> lives dirty dancing gives something new each time it is watched it <UNK> the watcher with nostalgia a feeling of wanting it to be 1963 again
<START> question how does a film merit two different titles like the <UNK> and strike force br br answer the film is <UNK> bad that the filmmakers couldn't even decide on a title br br this film is a <UNK> of martial arts death wish melodrama romance and other clich√© film techniques the story focuses on a vigilante group called the <UNK> led by agent simon william forsythe the group is hot in pursuit of a <UNK> multi creature named <UNK> andrew <UNK> who captures women and holds them hostage in the <UNK> urban world of south florida br br burt reynolds appears as a cameo in this film and his scene is entirely <UNK> to the action burt delivers a long monologue in one of the strangest i have ever heard this may have been <UNK> attempt at an irish <UNK> but the overall effect is a kind of perverse imitation of marlon brando in the godfather br br also appearing in this film is erika <UNK> who has <UNK> the inner circle of bizarre world <UNK> character kick boxes her way into an alliance with simon the <UNK> and erika will become a powerful strike force against evil in a film that has been delivered directly from the editing room to your cable tv box
<START> director michael ritchie and actor robert <UNK> second documentary style drama 'the <UNK> is a political satire that still seems fresh and <UNK> today so it's a pity that made a short time before seems so dated by contrast the music is ugly and the perhaps innovative <UNK> ing sequences are now standard in <UNK> coverage of the sport the world of <UNK> ing seems strangely amateurish probably accurately given the time the movie was made but it's hard to relate to today's professional world and the theme of americans in europe likewise seems in an age of ever easier travel perhaps the biggest problem is the flat plot <UNK> on the arrogant but enigmatic hero unfortunately it's a dreary performance from redford offering us little insight into his cares or motivations and a character driven film without much of a character is never a good bet i expected much but sadly this is a boring movie

<START> in one of the more under seen films of the late 1980's at a time when oliver stone was riding high with platoon and wall street and before his <UNK> born on the fourth of july he co scripted and directed this look at the world of radio specifically one radio host in the middle of texas this man is barry in a once in a career turn from eric <UNK> who wrote the original play and also co wrote the script barry is like a mix of howard stern and one of those <UNK> you hear on the radio stations many of us might turn off he's got ideas on his mind opinions and he's not only un afraid to speak them but also to stand up against the phone <UNK> the <UNK> indeed are the driving force in the film as barry has to combat against the mindless the obscene the racist and the purely absent minded as this goes on he also has to <UNK> with his boss alec baldwin and a hit or miss deal to go <UNK> outside the confines of the southern way station he's in br br while after seeing the film i felt curious as to see how it would've been done on stage i'd imagine it was a one man show as <UNK> has had several on the side the direction of the film is phenomenal stone has been known almost <UNK> as a director who loves quick cuts the <UNK> effects of montage and effects with the styles of camera work and other little tricks that give his films in the 90's a distinctive almost auteur look but in the 80's he had this energy and <UNK> quality to the look of the film and wasn't as <UNK> as the other films in order to add the proper intensity that is within the studio and head space of barry he and <UNK> robert richardson make the space seem claustrophobic at times gritty un sure and definitely on edge the scenes in the middle of the film when barry isn't in the studio are fairly standard but the style along with the substance in the radio scenes is among the best i've seen from the stone richardson combination br br and one cannot <UNK> the performance of <UNK> who can be obnoxious offensive <UNK> passive and everything that we love and hate in radio show <UNK> there is also a funny near distracting supporting role for michael <UNK> as kent michael joe who prank calls him one night and the next gets invited to the studio these scenes are a little uncomfortable for a viewer but it does get very much into the <UNK> head space of the 80's that barry is as intrigued as he is critical of the <UNK> may not <UNK> <UNK> but as he says to him it's your show indeed it's hard to cover everything that goes on within the talk and there is a lot of it but it's never boring and like himself it's not easy to ignore and when <UNK> goes into his climactic <UNK> on air with the background <UNK> around in a continuous <UNK> spin it becomes <UNK> and a reason why freedom of speech is so powerful br br stone has been <UNK> as a filmmaker of hot button issues who takes on subjects that were or still are controversial and gives them a life force that isn't always great but is all his own here his skills and ambitions don't get in the way of it's <UNK> if anything making an extremely skilled vision of what is essentially a near one man show which in and of itself is already well written

<START> this is a stupid movie when i saw it in a movie theater more than half the audience left before it was half over i stayed to the bitter end to show <UNK> i caught it again on television and it was much funnier still by no means a classic or even consistently hilarious but the family kinda grew on me i love jessica anyway if you've nothing better to do and it's free on t v you could do worse
<START> this episode had potential the basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment but a phone that constantly rings is somewhat interesting and when she explores the noise there is genuine tension and fear but stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had br br first of all the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction e g it's funny that the door <UNK> shut even though there is no wind this door has serious damage to it that wasn't here a minute ago the door opened by itself without me touching it etc given these supernatural <UNK> plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room wouldn't she take some before entering it maybe she could investigate in the day time or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else or maybe she could turn on the lights also while in the haunted apartment she decides to make numerous phone calls to the <UNK> and gets into an argument over who has the power to <UNK> the phone and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide just <UNK> the phone the phone company doesn't need to be involved walk up to the phone and <UNK> it case closed br br finally showing the phone <UNK> across the floor like it's alive was just comical if the director wanted the woman to get <UNK> by the phone card he could've done it in a way that didn't look <UNK> brave little <UNK> anyone
<START> though predictable and contrived not a bad movie it entertains which is all van damme hopes to do the <UNK> twin device is again used as in a large number of van <UNK> movies but it is not <UNK> except to long time fans natasha is gorgeous and worth watching action is decent nothing spectacular for van damme but exciting i can recommend to van damme fans and even to those who aren't but don't mind an action film with a good looking lead couple the russian mob is a nice concept and <UNK> for the day clearly not his best film but by no means his worst
<START> i already gave my comment on this movie under the name now under i want to add something now after a long time i have seen a lot of so called heroic bloodshed titles but not many come close to the action shown in john woo movies that's why after all these years i think it is strange that china white doesn't get the credit it deserves no matter what version you have seen the action is top notch the scenery china town in <UNK> is very unique you get the impression it is a large district but having lived in <UNK> myself i know it is only a small area part of the red light district which happen to have a lot of chinese stores and <UNK> but because of the way they shot the movie it actually looks like a big and important territory where people know not to mess with the <UNK> chinese mafia besides the action china white is a compelling gangster drama with some good acting for this i have to give credit to <UNK> wong too bad we don't see much of him lately since he has a lot of potential must see movie
<START> <UNK> is a terrific heist movie and one from which subsequent heist films have drawn ever since jules <UNK> had a feel for the seedy underworld in which these thieves live you will not find here the hollywood <UNK> of <UNK> eleven the robbers in <UNK> don't rob for the thrill and they're not playing a game they rob to survive to pay for their children's upbringing to prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world the much <UNK> heist scene is a nail <UNK> filmed in virtual silence i did have the feeling that the plot went on a bit longer than it needed to but the high speed race to deliver the child to his mother that ends the film is classic br br be warned this movie is very bleak but it's also very good br br grade a
<START> the <UNK> of this film contains a few holes you could drive a massive truck through but i <UNK> that isn't always top <UNK> in horror two elderly sisters in rural england keep their brother in the <UNK> since more than 30 years now he escaped and started a killing spree focusing on <UNK> that are nearby we only did we thought was best for <UNK> they keep on repeating and ¬ñ strangely ¬ñ all the army officers love these women and don't doubt their sincerity even though 5 of their men died i don't know whether to find the revelation near the end suspenseful ¬Ö or tedious in a way this film reminded me about <UNK> and old in that black comedy classic two half insane siblings mother their goofy younger brother as well yet they do the killing there the old ladies in the beast in the are by no means less crazy though the <UNK> in this early 70's film is very amateurish and cheap but there are a few neat attempts to build up the tension too many old <UNK> talk about the good ol' days though and that rarely is something you seek in a horror film with such an appealing title <UNK> <UNK> who may be recognized by classic film buffs plays one of the sisters she gave image to the queen of england is the legendary errol flynn <UNK> film the sea <UNK>
<START> many of us who went through high school probably made it through alright without having to take a physics course i know i didn't but after watching this program i surely wish i had br br this documentary is a guide to the <UNK> grail of the quest to <UNK> all the fundamental forces of the universe into one <UNK> that <UNK> einstein during the last years of his life brian green a professor at columbia university introduces us to this mind blowing theory in a wonderfully simple way and leaves us with an even greater appreciation for the universe we live in br br we start with the <UNK> possibility of a <UNK> that could <UNK> and explain everything everything in this universe including the four fundamental forces that we know that exist the strong nuclear force the weak nuclear force and gravity green takes us on a tour of how our understanding of the universe came into view with the work of <UNK> then einstein and then later on to the revolution of the physics at the quantum level br br but it is at this point that we run into a problem that has plagued <UNK> for years and one that no one has been able to solve just yet how can we <UNK> all these forces that we know together we find as green constantly points out throughout the problem that the answer to this <UNK> problem could be in the theory of strings however if we are to describe the universe in terms of string theory there is a very big price to pay br br it turns out that out of the mind numbing <UNK> <UNK> of string theory that as a consequence we find that we could possibly be living in a universe filled with not just 3 <UNK> that you and i see every day plus 1 for time but rather that we may actually live in a universe of 11 <UNK> but the <UNK> that <UNK> out of that theory doesn't stop there the possibility exists that there may actually be parallel <UNK> some of them right next to you and me could we possibly take such a theory that leads to such consequences seriously as green points out we have yet to fully find out but we do know that the <UNK> that has <UNK> from these <UNK> are already showing us that the universe still has much to show us br br for those of you who fear that you won't be able to understand the concepts in this program fear not professor green does a wonderful job of doing away with the <UNK> and harder concepts of physics and instead focuses more on the concept which when you take away all the <UNK> from it transforms from a monstrous beast into an incredibly simple and as green constantly points out concept viewers of this program need no prior background in science the concepts are so simple even a child could understand them br br when you finish this program you will truly come to understand what a wonderful and mysterious universe it is that we live in
<START> did you ever think like after watching a horror movie with a group of friends wow this is so cool we have got to make a splatter horror movie ourselves some day soon i bet it isn't as difficult as it seems well this must have been what went through the minds of the young campbell brothers back in 2003 presumably right after watching sam <UNK> the evil dead or a similar independent horror classic this demon summer however is so bad it's embarrassing these young amateurish filmmakers obviously worship the horror genre and know their classics but that nearly doesn't make them talented i've seen quite a lot lousy b movies in my years as a horror fanatic but this honestly ranks as one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made and it's quite sad to be this open hearted because the whole cast and crew clearly had good intentions there's pretty much no script at all a duo of thugs simply steals a mysterious book from a bum and whilst reading some <UNK> of it one of them <UNK> into a hideous demon that starts killing off members of all the different teenager groups <UNK> hot catholic girls <UNK> and <UNK> that's about it except of course for all the obligatory clich√©s like the hot girl falling for the biggest <UNK> etc etc the performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use <UNK> they just stand there <UNK> until the script says it's their turn to interact i hate that some of make up effects are remotely decent but still not spectacular and the soundtrack contains some of the most awful punk songs ever this film should never have been released i can very well imagine that it must have been fun to be a part of the production but it's utterly <UNK> and doesn't feature the slightest redeeming element not even a bit of amateur nudity damned
<START> after reading the reviews i decided to rent the dvd version br br i like classical music and wanted to learn more about bach br br i was disappointed i guess i do not know enough about bach music and the the comments were not enough for me to understand the importance or what music was being played br br maybe it would be appropriate with the <UNK> of an expert in <UNK> music that can explain the film br br i really tried and saw the whole film <UNK> that i would be able to enjoy at least some of it but i did not br br see it at your own risk
<START> i know that full moon or any other film studio for that matter could never <UNK> the fun and cheesy sci fi feeling that was the original <UNK> ' and with the last two entries in the series having jack <UNK> in medieval times instead of futuristic los angeles it became quite obvious that there really was little hope in <UNK> the <UNK> series breathing new life into a film is one thing but taking our main character out of his element and putting him into the past well it didn't work so now with <UNK> 6 full moon has <UNK> so much new life into the series that we don't even deal with jack <UNK> any more we now deal with his daughter jo jack is in her body and must go into the past and fight the <UNK> one more time br br minor spoiler first scene of the film revealed br br to prove how bad this movie is you only need watch the first two minutes of the film when the original jack <UNK> appears on the screen but it's not actually tim <UNK> it's clips of him and sound <UNK> strung together trust me you can tell they're strung together horribly to provide the viewer the last of the true jack <UNK> humor and from this point on things only go down hill having this girl jo <UNK> as our main character while jack <UNK> is supposed to be in her body is the worst idea in the world having this cute young woman act as a rough and tough man isn't the right track at all it doesn't work and it really comes off as foolish br br i'm not going to go into the aspects of special effects and makeup because most reading this know what full moon has become a really really low budget enterprise i don't know what to say about this movie except i really wish full moon could be like it was in the days of demonic toys puppet master and <UNK> 1 back then while the special effects weren't great the story telling was they made serious b movies for serious b movie and horror fans and that just doesn't take place today with the new full moon studios i <UNK> for the good ol' days and truly hope that full moon can pull itself out of this horrible <UNK> that they're in right now br br <UNK> 6 gets a 2 out of 10

<START> there are questions that sometimes <UNK> over us and have no answer two women <UNK> find themselves <UNK> in each other's arms as corny as the expression sounds that is exactly what happens and <UNK> that they cannot answer their own question as to what <UNK> their relationship when their very own society has no name to what they are <UNK> <UNK> somewhat <UNK> titled fire is the first of a loosely connected trilogy here linked by the theme of the elements and more symbolic than <UNK> fire as <UNK> erotic passion does not make an appearance here since the women the older and more feminine <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the younger more <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> come to realize they share a lot more than common ideas and affection for each other and stand for what they believe is their passion for each other despite the opposition faced by their very traditional husbands and families as in water fire is deeply spiritual even if it technically falls into the mode of sentimental melodrama where water much like the weight of the word carries a stronger meaning that ultimately <UNK> its definition even so it's a very beautiful picture and a strong voice from a strong director
<START> christopher <UNK> oscar winner timothy <UNK> gives up on being a priest and he's returning home for an uncertain future when his best friend lee oscar winner sean penn is a drug dealer who's always gets in trouble and enjoys taking drugs a bit too much when christopher gets a job by working in a top secret government place titled <UNK> and lee both have wealthy families which they hoped to make it out of their own when <UNK> decides to take secret documents out of curiosity which these documents are supposed to be destroyed he decides to sell these secret documents for a cheap price for the soviet union with the help of his best friend but both of them never knew how far they will go for <UNK> documents for a living and since they are both amateurs both of them have betrayed their country for top secret information br br directed by the late oscar winner john <UNK> the <UNK> eye for an eye midnight cowboy made an interesting character drama about two young men taking the wrong path in life oscar winners <UNK> and penn are both extraordinary good in the film the movie is even occasionally funny and quite disturbing at times david <UNK> nearly steals the show as the man who works for the soviet union this picture has a familiar cast in the supporting roles it was quite underrated when it was first released despite some great reviews by some of the top film critics this picture is actually based on a true story there's some flaws in the storytelling like these two leads characters but overall it's a movie worth seeing based on a novel by robert lindsey screenplay by oscar winner steven american gangster <UNK> <UNK> list
<START> tragic hero is a film that is most definitely trying to <UNK> the classic godfather films focusing on family crime loyalty and revenge also this is part of a two part series as the godfather also was at the time however this film comes nowhere near the level of those classic films and actually <UNK> worse than other <UNK> thrillers being released in hong kong at the time br br one reason is the acting with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> fat the acting is generally over the top and unbelievable the audience tends to find the proceedings humorous simply because the actors' inability to maintain any degree of seriousness as a result we find the film not truly emotionally involving or intense since we don't particularly care what occurs with these characters br br another reason is its lack of focus the narrative tries to <UNK> many different story elements into the film but this results in portions of the movie becoming underdeveloped as well as lacking any real sense of <UNK> the audience sometimes becomes lost at the proceedings we are viewing not knowing what the character's motivations are br br the film's climax does contain a decent gun fight but again since we don't care about the characters we don't care who lives or who dies the scene loses it's intensity and suspense because of this the other action set pieces are rather mundane in nature with a feeling of it being too controlled rather than free flowing br br in general this is a strictly average film and isn't recommended to the general film viewer only hard core genre <UNK> and fans of <UNK> <UNK> fat should consider this film for viewing
<START> even an old cynical doctor who fan like myself can be left breathless by watching an episode of my favourite show it happened previously during <UNK> finale and it happened watching this episode it doesn't happen often though but the impossible planet is an example of both the show and of television at its very very best this is stunning television br br the doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see strange writing on the wall and the audience many of who will be moving behind the <UNK> are instantly <UNK> a door opens and horrible monsters start stalking the time <UNK> this might have taken up an entire 25 minute episode in the original show but all this takes place in he pre title sequence you may miss the longer drawn out format of the original show but at least this new series is tightly plotted and if we're treated to a disappointing story then at least it's usually only for one week br br there is nothing to disappointment a viewer here it is doctor who at its most traditional best writer matt jones and director james strong have gone out of their way to make a story that will be regarded for years to come they do this by <UNK> a doom laden narrative the doctor and rose lose the <UNK> and they're stuck with the protagonists in the far <UNK> future it's interesting how many stories never feature this type of plot point where the doctor and his companions no longer have access to the <UNK> which makes for a more intriguing type of story without doubt the highlight is the scene where goes to look for toby only to find him standing on the surface of the planet where he turns and <UNK> her outside everything from acting make up and murray <UNK> music makes this a scene that genuinely shocks its audience br br i can imagine immediately after this episode the bbc received a <UNK> of complaints for <UNK> parents saying how <UNK> their children were that it took them several hours to get them from behind the family <UNK> and that they're now <UNK> to sleep with the lights out to do this complaining would be to deny the magic of doctor who yes it can <UNK> and yes such images will burn themselves in to the mind of a child something they will never forget even if hey live to be a hundred but i will bet my life that these same <UNK> children would have spent the week begging that no matter what they'll be allowed to watch the next episode
<START> 1998 d john kevin gage elizabeth <UNK> brett <UNK> robert englund tucker amy smart dee <UNK> twisted sister <UNK> disturbing scenes of torture this dark disgusting movie about a sadistic psychopath who <UNK> teens into his torture chamber via the internet <UNK> from ex 80s rock band twisted sister plays the <UNK> psychopath who is a <UNK> <UNK> no pun intended on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is wasted as one of the <UNK> mothers <UNK> brother of woody delivers one of the worst cop performances i have ever seen in a movie and proves why this is her only screen credit with an equally pathetic performance the heavy metal soundtrack is ultimately numbing the torture scenes very graphic and gross and the ending just sucks rating 3 out of 10 rated r for graphic violence and torture strong language and sexual situations
<START> an absolute classic of 80's scare <UNK> this one isn't like any other as it <UNK> <UNK> size wild eyed psychotic youngsters with an urge to kill against all the grown ups in town bud from just one of the guys 80's gold again plays one of the killer kids and he's paired up with one of the little girls jake blues tries to purchase in the blues brothers there is a third blond boy but he keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason the violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly gruesome in spots the demonic gang of smiling kids though somehow possessed by extra <UNK> means bear little resemblance to the <UNK> ish children of the damned who never thought to use <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to kill those <UNK> adults julie brown not downtown julie brown the other one shows her rack like three times as she dances around in her bedroom this movie is a <UNK> that i cannot believe i missed growing up in the 80's this would have been my absolute favorite movie as a kid if i had seen it where is the sequel the ending begs for this movie is just incredible seek it out at all costs
<START> and nothing else br br one of my friends bought the problem child <UNK> pack contains the first two problem child s in one disc and we decided to watch the sequel because it was funnier br br there were many funny moments in the movie the vomit scene that's all i need to say <UNK> the dog after eating <UNK> down and numerous others the movie is nothing but toilet humor but it's hilarious other than the funny moments though this movie has little to offer br br john ritter <UNK> the crap out of me because it sounds like he's reading out of a book the man can't act in this one sorry br br although i can't say if i would find the movie funny now we were blown when we watched it it's a perfect movie for a rainy day but nothing else don't expect oscar material on this one guys
<START> to put it simply mind of <UNK> is the worst <UNK> show on comedy central and quite possibly all of television ever i love comedy central and watch many shows and movies there all the time but every time the intro for this show even starts after some good comedy i can't find the remote fast enough br br <UNK> tells used worn out racial jokes in a bad attempt at being controversial then will point out the <UNK> he just talked about in the audience as if to say <UNK> liked it so all of your race likes it and by <UNK> me <UNK> give me a break <UNK> i don't know if those people are plants or not but just because you go to a black guy and high five him after one of your ridiculous jokes doesn't mean he thinks you're funny it just means you put him on the spot and what else is he going to do <UNK> you on tv he gives the impression that his jokes are deep meaningful and thought provoking which is apparent in his commercials but when you actually watch the show almost 100 of what he says is common sense he also claims that only smart people get some of his jokes but you don't have to be any smarter than a monkey to understand what he just said when he says that maybe you need to go finish 3rd grade carlos the guy goes on to say that he says what others are only thinking but i think you'll find that if anyone was thinking what he says they figured out all on their own that it was ridiculous and that's why they never said it in the first place br br all in all watch 1 episode and be done with it if you must because after you've seen 1 episode you've seen them all why comedy central keeps <UNK> this horrible show is well beyond me if you're looking for good comedy look elsewhere because you will find very little of it here
<START> this is one of a <UNK> of movies where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of <UNK> to be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man mo and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film br br the cinematic aspect of <UNK> <UNK> photography seems to have left out both close ups and breasts mo and <UNK> <UNK> effort revealed the passion of the two actresses plastic holding passion there's also beetle <UNK> as <UNK> would have put it this plastic <UNK> goes up your butt the rat porn and subsequent rat <UNK> is awesome br br alright so if you are still reading let us explain who we are mo teaches at <UNK> and we are a group of her students who finishing a film class with her decided to get <UNK> faced and watch here directorial debut she also wrote <UNK> girls i can't tell you how much that's been <UNK> into our <UNK> so this movie is quite the experience at the very bottom of this post will be a drinking game we created for this movie br br about 13 minutes into this game none of us could see straight the sheer amount of in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink to <UNK> an elephant there was something secretly <UNK> about seeing two <UNK> girls hit on a kurt <UNK> <UNK> with absolutely no context save for his mysterious scene at the <UNK> store where he was oh so naturally reading a local newspaper because that's what we all do the heart shaped glasses were delightfully derivative of <UNK> and something about that provocative scene of the nude <UNK> up boy suggests the director's history of homosexual pornographic experiments we wish we were kidding br br enough intellectual <UNK> on to the drinking game this will ensure that the viewing experience is a positive one it's very simple and very likely to send at least one member of your party to immediate care br br the mo <UNK> drinking game 1 every time you see anything related to pornography take a drink 2 every time you see auteur mo name appear take a drink 3 sex 4 plastic <UNK> require two drinks 5 any time somebody points a gun at another character take a drink at this point you will probably need to pee pee any remaining <UNK> from your body 6 any time there is blood including lady blood please take a <UNK> 7 the underused <UNK> <UNK> girl requires one drink per second 8 gratuitous use of the magic black man requires one drink 9 if you can't figure out the through line keep drinking 10 whenever you are able to predict a line take a drink trust us it's easy br br that's it internet keep drinking and try not to get <UNK> br br <UNK> punch jr
<START> we just saw this movie in austin texas at the <UNK> south <UNK> yesterday afternoon it had me laughing out loud many times the scene about albert <UNK> thoughts on humanity hit me over and over and i couldn't stop laughing it's too bad it's not in more theaters i know a lot of friends that are <UNK> to see this movie welcome to <UNK> i love you great work to all involved also if you see it make sure to stay until the end of the credits as well i'm going to take my family to see it again this weekend for sure if you're a fan of office space and <UNK> and <UNK> then you have to go see this movie it's a classic and no one knows that it's out so if you're in the mood to see something funny this weekend definitely check it out
<START> so i guess that bud and lou just liked to mess with classic stories although they did have some interesting results in this case they're baby sitting a bad boy and lou tries to read him jack and the but falls asleep and dreams that he's jack and <UNK> the butcher and they climb the to rescue the prince and princess from the giant buddy <UNK> br br i think that my favorite scene was when lou was trying to make the giant an <UNK> and well i'll let you see what happens as this was an <UNK> and <UNK> movie they did have a few unnecessary songs but other than that it was pretty funny for other interpretations of the classic story <UNK> and <UNK> island both had episodes portraying it
<START> this is a great flick it is funny for everyone even adults we got jason <UNK> <UNK> like killer in this along with other wacky characters very funny flick for children of all ages must of rented this every time we went to the video store buster and <UNK> make a good pair and gotta love the duck he is probably my favorite character i was never big on the tv show but this movie just brings back so many great memories must see for families fans of the show or anyone enjoyable no matter how small or old you are rent it now at your local video store br br p s needs a dvd release
<START> this movie has a great chase scene if you listen to the soundtrack when the cars are chasing each other it sounds very much like the soundtrack from the movie bullet you'll hear the shifting of a 4 speed and they'll show the <UNK> <UNK> in roy <UNK> car it's an automatic <UNK> <UNK> i think one of the funniest moments in the movie is when the bad guy richard lynch is looking at the driver of the car they are in like the guy is nuts the crook who runs the garage is also the guy who in the the first rocky movie boss good movie also when the door gets ripped off you can see the guy sitting in the car just <UNK> the door open the guy who helps him out of the car kind of looks like mr brady from the brady bunch doesn't he
<START> i'm always surprised given that the famous title track of 2001 is called also that nobody nobody i've read anyway has noted the parallels between the movie and <UNK> famous work also the idea of man's <UNK> into a star child an <UNK> form of an <UNK> more advanced being is an explicit part of n 's there is a prominent passage called on how a <UNK> becomes a lion and a lion becomes a child in which n describes the first incarnation of the <UNK> as a child <UNK> both the <UNK> side of man the <UNK> always asking to bear more weight and the <UNK> <UNK> will to power side of man the lion the fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence and also said that man is a rope tied between <UNK> and the <UNK> the structure of the movie fits that description a brief history of man as beast until we become truly man by <UNK> weapons and <UNK> reason then a long sequence about man the rope as it were and then a brief glimpse of the <UNK> the of how these <UNK> occurred and the suggestion that an <UNK> force caused them is also <UNK> in he makes it pretty clear that he doesn't have a clue how people are going to be able to <UNK> these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an <UNK> to show us how to go under <UNK> psychedelic sequence at the near end could be seen as kubrick's best 1960's style attempt at depicting the mystical going under br br i know these parallels are pretty broad and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that i have not personally seen it but i just wanted to mention them if for no other reason than to try to <UNK> the myth that <UNK> was ultimately a gloomy <UNK> few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy and it is in my opinion <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> the case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a <UNK> of updated for the modern age feel free to disregard the outright <UNK> of my <UNK> everything to <UNK>
<START> the only way i can feel good about having handed over these precious minutes of my life is everyday telling someone how awful it was and even if i say it once a day every day for the rest of my life i will not fully get my point across just dumb br br there's a difference in movies like this and movies like elephant or fat guy goes two of my other least favorite movies the latter two were terrible yes but that was that <UNK> almighty takes a strong cast and attempts to kill them all <UNK> sykes <UNK> hill john goodman and steve <UNK> why god why all these people have much better talent now every time i see any of them i will think of this terrible movie br br the only reason i gave this a 2 instead of a 1 was when i saw the movie there was a mentally challenged elderly woman who thought the <UNK> of bird <UNK> and getting hurt by tools while building jokes were so funny that she didn't stop laughing the entire time nearly <UNK> out at several times
<START> in april <UNK> new york city faced an <UNK> crisis eugene a <UNK> arriving from mexico had arrived in the city bringing with him the deadly <UNK> virus he stumbled off a bus complaining of fever and a headache and soon died in a hospital but not before he had infected a dozen <UNK> by the damage was already done for the first time in decades <UNK> stalked the streets of new york the city's health authorities acted quickly to <UNK> <UNK> and contain the virus <UNK> a free <UNK> campaign that saw over six million new <UNK> against <UNK> thanks to their swift response the virus was contained with minimal <UNK> the <UNK> nevertheless must have left an <UNK> mark for several years later it was followed by two similarly themed film noir thrillers in which doctors must track down a single <UNK> <UNK> in a city of millions <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the streets 1950 ' and earl lower budget 'the killer that stalked new york 1950 ' br br film unfolds in an <UNK> <UNK> drama style reed <UNK> narration sounds as though it was <UNK> straight from a <UNK> <UNK> facts as if reading off the official police <UNK> this technique does feel a little cheap at times but fortunately the narration is largely <UNK> to the film's <UNK> as well as providing some <UNK> filler during breaks in the plot the killer stalking new york in this story is not a <UNK> from mexico but beautiful diamond <UNK> sheila <UNK> evelyn <UNK> who has just arrived from cuba within days sheila has two parties <UNK> pursuing her a <UNK> agent barry <UNK> looking to arrest her for <UNK> crimes and a team of doctors led by william bishop who have identified her as the source of the <UNK> <UNK> as in <UNK> in the streets ' an otherwise routine <UNK> is given a <UNK> sense of urgency particularly when those in pursuit initially have no idea as to the identity or appearance of their suspect br br 'the killer that stalked new york ' for the most part manages to <UNK> its low production budget aside from a <UNK> few lines of dialogue we have to stop it <UNK> dr wood at one point as though coming to a difficult decision the filmmakers and cast members allow the story to unfold in a realistic engrossing fashion indeed in this regard the low budget quite possibly aids the film's intentions <UNK> a documentary style that adds to the <UNK> of the <UNK> scenario evelyn <UNK> is excellent in the leading role showing <UNK> <UNK> in the face of <UNK> torment by the film's end she appears so brutally <UNK> by her illness that it's almost painful to look at her face aside from the virus charles is the main villain of the piece as <UNK> greedy and <UNK> husband who rest assured gets everything that's coming to him and if all <UNK> looked like dorothy malone perhaps catching <UNK> wouldn't seem like such a bad break after all
<START> detective burt williams has been on the trail of the infamous poe killer for nearly three years <UNK> daughter kris williams a homicide agent for the fbi along with her partner sean michaels take over burt reluctantly steps down from the case and <UNK> for the next seven months the poe killer continues his murderous rampage until kris discovers that the killer uses internet chat rooms to seduce his prey she <UNK> in as <UNK> lee and is quickly captured by poe killer it's time for burt to find the <UNK> and free his daughter before it's too late amateurish and <UNK> <UNK> horror flick with no suspense and a bit of nasty gore the acting is hilariously terrible the characters are painfully dumb and the killer is not menacing still i have seen worse indie horror flicks 3 out of 10
<START> spoilers spoilers the cell 2000 out of four br br do you believe there is a part of yourself deep inside in your mind with things you don't want other people to see during a session when i'm inside i get to see those things br br catherine <UNK> br br and so do we one of the most visually stimulating films of the year the cell is a love hate movie either you love it or you hate it i can understand the reasons some people dislike this production with a story that combines disturbing serial killers with mind <UNK> the cell is too much for some viewers others will not understand the complex actions and emotions of the film i think it's one of the year's most engrossing films br br making his feature film <UNK> debut mark creates an imaginative world of rich colorful images and provocative characters the filmmakers take advantage of every shot conceived ideas for the cell in 1993 when he decided to combine two of his major interests mind <UNK> and serial killers he was reportedly influenced by such directors as wes craven george romero and david <UNK> they would probably be proud of such an imagination br br the film combines two major <UNK> one about scientific exploration of the human mind and the other about a psychopath who murders young women for his own sexual pleasure catherine <UNK> jennifer lopez a child <UNK> is part of a <UNK> study at the campbell center a research clinic because of her <UNK> personality scientists chose <UNK> to enter the mind of a <UNK> <UNK> in hopes to revive his brain into waking br br a sick demented serial killer <UNK> the streets within an abandoned rural <UNK> vincent <UNK> locks innocent female victims in a large glass cell where he then <UNK> them and performs sadistic sexual <UNK> with their bodies the killer escapes from the fbi every time they draw near until now a violent <UNK> <UNK> him <UNK> the fbi captures his forever unconscious body unfortunately he already prepared the cell with his latest victim in forty hours the cell will fill with water and is the only man who knows the location of his victim br br the fbi takes this situation to campbell center where catherine enters the mind of hoping to discover the location of his latest victim before the cell fills with water sending the woman to a <UNK> grave br br the science fiction portions of the story relied on both real science and <UNK> fiction in the creation of the <UNK> and transfer system the premise takes a long time to develop but it is worth the wait it is far fetched but that doesn't matter the film makes us believe even if you don't suspend disbelief however the visual <UNK> provides an engaging setting to enjoy br br according to the film's production notes mark was thrilled to work with the director named because they both think visually <UNK> is known for his attention to detail stunning art direction and highly developed abilities to tell a story when i wrote 'the explains i surrounded myself with <UNK> or color copies of <UNK> paintings or photographs while i was working so i'm thinking visually and is a highly visual director has a similar frame of visual references which made for a very smooth collaboration br br vincent <UNK> provides the film with a <UNK> and no actor could have accomplished his character any better he delivers a mysterious disturbing and engaging performance i think that my character is in a way trapped in himself <UNK> <UNK> he also <UNK> the psychology of serial killers to help get him beneath the surface of the character his in depth performance <UNK> pays off beautifully br br while the actors writer and director do wonders with their material the real honor goes to the film's behind the scenes talent the director of photography paul production designer tom costume designer april <UNK> special effects <UNK> clay and visual effects <UNK> kevin <UNK> they bring the world of the cell to life it's is an extraordinary world worthy of several viewings some movies you watch others you experience the cell falls into the later category br br
<START> i made it about halfway through this movie and at that point realized that i absolutely didn't care how it ended it is basically a bland teen comedy that i only watched because i like helen <UNK> who is in fact very good as an <UNK> cruel teacher br br the basic idea of the movie or let's say the first half of the movie since i don't know or care how the second half goes has been done before most notably in 9 to 5 and a comparison between the two shows how thoroughly <UNK> gets it wrong you need to feel things are <UNK> out of control in a way that makes you feel events are inevitable and you need well defined interesting characters who you care about and you don't have that not the worst movie i've ever seen but it never grabbed me for a second
<START> i love <UNK> terrific characters and poignant situations make this one <UNK> loved bill murray is hysterical and you gotta love that 4 mile trail race at the end a total classic and one of my favorites now for about 20 years it brings back fond memories of camp and deals nicely with the experience of being rejected by foolish peers and the <UNK> brought one by being rescued by a sympathetic adult tons of great one liners and quite an assortment of <UNK> <UNK> this is the kind of movie where you repeat key phrases among friends for years afterward also nothing overtly crude and what a sweet late <UNK> soundtrack to bring on just the right amount of nostalgia i can't say enough about <UNK> it's a classic be <UNK> all the sequels are <UNK> stink bombs that simply bought the name rights for marketing they have no connection to <UNK> masterpiece
<START> it's the best film that takes the first place at the <UNK> and an useful films ever made in this poor country really u people even don't know what the word cinema means and u cast votes for movies i'm really curious to know how many movies of p p p or l <UNK> have u seen the score of this experiment it reflects a lot of way of understanding things and to recognize a good quality movie when u see it we the romanian people have only one movie and until this day the status hasn't change that movie is but i don't lose my time thinking how many of you have seen it that is a movie that respects all the required of an movie from the script to the frames and even to the quality clarity of the picture even are past over him <UNK> years i recommend to the voters to search for better movies and then vote kudos will see u later
<START> this movie had a very convoluted plot and very contrived setting that i frankly could not follow which is surprising considering the acting and dialogue could have only been the product of a writing if you like kathy ireland then maybe you'd want to see this the movie was probably made as a vehicle to try to get her into hollywood but if that was its goal i would have to say that i hope she didn't <UNK> too much money in its production
<START> okay here's the deal there's this american pilot who's flying along <UNK> his own business when suddenly he's <UNK> by evil cowardly non american fighter planes they're middle eastern types but suffice to say they don't like apple pie or elvis <UNK> who proceed to shoot him down now this american pilot was doing nothing wrong but those evil non americans didn't care and before you know it he's <UNK> up in a foreign jail and sentenced to death br br now what would normally happen here is that the us military would carpet bomb a couple of nearby towns until the pilot was released but not this time those evil peace <UNK> types probably got involved and managed to stop any kind of massacre as you can imagine this doesn't please the <UNK> family and the evil foreign dictator has this smug <UNK> look about him he'll make those americans pay oh yes indeed br br but he didn't <UNK> on doug masters the captured pilots 16 year old son you see doug has been able to fly a plane longer than he can drive a car which can't be that long and decides to fly into that evil foreign country and get his dad back so with the help of his friends doug and his retired pilot <UNK> doug <UNK> a two man air raid on the <UNK> br br now you'd think that this plan would be bound to fail but you'd be wrong sure those middle eastern types might be all veteran pilots but got an ace up his <UNK> he <UNK> to rock music when he flies after shooting down a dozen or so enemy planes and blowing up an oil <UNK> doug lands at an airport and gets his now wounded dad <UNK> the plane understandably the evil not quite so smug anymore dictator gets quite annoyed at these antics and takes to the <UNK> himself in <UNK> to shoot down doug but the young <UNK> <UNK> to some more rock music and blows the villain out of the sky <UNK> br br after doug and <UNK> have shot down 90 of their air force the <UNK> send up their last few planes in a rather poor attempt to shoot doug down but in the nick of time a flight of us turn up and scare them away br br i cannot recommend this film enough it was the first ever <UNK> movie that i brought and until i was twenty i kept hoping that my dad would get shot down over a foreign country so that i could rescue him but he's doesn't like flying so it didn't happen
<START> i have never missed an episode david morse is a wonderful actor and i am hoping that this show can survive it certainly beats out that <UNK> crap i love the storyline and would actually like to see him as a cop again someday i give the show a 10
<START> a heap of human flesh lies asleep on a red <UNK> this is the hunk of naked meat that is little joe a new york hustler who lives with his <UNK> wife and baby child the film follows a day in his life after he's <UNK> from sleep by his wife demanding that he go out and do the traditional male thing be a <UNK> but the use she wants to put the bread to is to pay for her new <UNK> abortion we certainly aren't in the traditional family unit here br br after playing with his child joe hits the streets to cruise for <UNK> the <UNK> come thick and fast the ordinary gay man who wants to meet him again because they work well together the old english classical <UNK> who pays 100 to see joe pose like an ancient greek <UNK> the female topless dancer who blows joe then boasts about being raped the <UNK> gym bunny who doesn't think that what he and joe do together is <UNK> after a hard day's work joe returns home exhausted only to be put down by his wife and the girlfriend he goes back to sleep as they <UNK> and <UNK> him br br flesh is fascinating as it takes what is a traditional classical mainstream structure it has an <UNK> incident the money for the abortion and set up a confrontation and a resolution albeit a very downbeat one even a protagonist with a strongly motivated goal and then proceeds to concentrate on the details of the day to day routine of these people who are perfectly ordinary to themselves but extraordinary to most mainstream people it all seems very authentic and natural it's hard to see the acting the actors are so fully being their roles but yet the whole thing is a piece of cunning <UNK> a beautifully drawn portrait or an <UNK> <UNK> statue director <UNK> carefully plants every incident every encounter around his theme of human flesh become <UNK> <UNK> but with such cunning slight of hand that you almost don't notice him doing it the wife <UNK> <UNK> sexual <UNK> the old <UNK> <UNK> a long gone order of classical beauty which created art and poetry from human beauty the <UNK> friends of the stripper package themselves as women whilst reading a hollywood magazine in which real women are <UNK> as products the gym bunny buys <UNK> friendship and affection thinks artificial porn is real and can't tell as we can't that joe is performing his friendship and <UNK> for the cash the film itself presents itself as the <UNK> plus ultra of cinematic realism but what we might as well be dealing with here is fine art or an early example of concept art br br the genius a word not lightly used of <UNK> was to find a way of taking <UNK> arty <UNK> to film making which were interesting sure but boring as hell and making them into <UNK> products which remain amongst the most intriguing works of cinema art ever made commercial <UNK> <UNK> flesh and trash and heat with a product label andy <UNK> which sells an idea about the product as much as the product itself yet just as you reel from <UNK> cynicism you are <UNK> by his ability to still maintain the highest of standards and depth of meaning the constant what seem like camera flashes continually draw attention to the <UNK> nature of what one is witnessing yet you get drawn into the illusion all the same flesh is surely one of the most extraordinary pieces of cinema magic to ever <UNK> an audience
<START> the original psycho 1960 is widely considered as alfred hitchcock's best work and certainly in my opinion is one of the best movies of all time the decision to film a shot by shot remake is therefore a little puzzling br br the cast in the original was flawless so the cast of this remake had a lot to live up to vince vaughn as norman bates was not a good choice for the lead he is too much of a pretty boy hunk and is not very convincing as bates i can imagine actors such as mark <UNK> or john <UNK> doing a much better job in the role anne <UNK> as marion <UNK> does a <UNK> job but one keeps mentally comparing her to janet leigh <UNK> moore is a much better actress than she shows here and <UNK> merely walks through his role the best of this new cast is william h macy as the private detective br br although director gus van <UNK> does an acceptable job he can't build the suspense the way hitchcock did and why did he change the scene in the basement of the house in the original the atmosphere is dark and <UNK> and closed in whereas in this version it takes place in a <UNK> lit laboratory like setting and i think the black white photography of the original has a definite advantage over the color version br br maybe another flaw could be the fact that most <UNK> have seen the original and know what is going to happen and when br br all i can say is if it ain't broke don't fix it br br
<START> thought provoking <UNK> depiction of the human <UNK> of war a small but <UNK> view of one family's interactions with the enemy during the civil war in kentucky this movie <UNK> the <UNK> of war showing it's effect on not only the soldier but the entire family unit br br a lot of today's movies show war as an opportunity to highlight the hero's and other glamorous features of war but very little attempts to show the true effect war actually takes on a community this movie attempts this through a retelling of a person's memory of those days this movie is stated to be loose translation of an actual events when in reality this movie is probably a factual reality of hundreds perhaps thousands of actual events during the civil war i highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie
<START> maybe james p lay knows what do to in the sound department if a director him br br in 2007 ' however he cannot accomplish anything as a writer or as a director br br there is absolutely nothing in this film no story no character building no events no atmosphere no plot no twists no acting that deserves that name br br in any of those <UNK> this movie is <UNK> of light years behind any short film that has some actual thinking in it even a one minute one br br it has nothing to do with any of david lynch's works br br i actually think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the west br br recommend it only to your worst enemies
<START> i love this film i've seen it 1000 x on dvd and i cant say enough about it it has it all comedy awesome action and incredible stunts fx samuel jackson steals the show here big time i dont think there <UNK> a moment that he's in that he <UNK> funny everyone knows that when you make an <UNK> you make an ass out of you and the f x are great the bridge truck explosion is incredible although the sound <UNK> all that great when samuel drives out of the truck the sound is off a little i think and what he says is priceless for those of you who own it on dvd put the audio in french it's even emotional moments are great when the bad guy discovers that <UNK> charlie's daughter is his is great this is a great film that no action fan can do without i also <UNK> <UNK> island aside from all the negative publicity it kicks
<START> what makes this documentary special from a film making perspective is its which <UNK> the audience to in the delight of gypsy music it <UNK> the form of documentary while <UNK> a <UNK> of sound and movement that invites us to celebrate the primal similarity found within the traveling music of historically traveling peoples br br indeed the film itself is a single take of sweeping movement that travels the globe and transitions effortlessly from one <UNK> culture to the next br br watching this film one's breath is taken away by the simple beauty in our common connection to music rhythm and dance if there is a more deeply spiritual flowing homage to the sound and movement of gypsy cultures it has yet to be filmed
<START> this movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie but apparently there was no script when they shot this waste of time the trailer makes this out to be a comedy but the film can't decide if it wants to be a comedy a drama a romance or an action film press releases <UNK> that shatner and <UNK> made this movie because they loved the script what were they thinking if you like william shatner i do see free enterprise instead
<START> please if this is about technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves i think i missed his entire point because i walked out feeling like relied on cold war era footage of space exploration and had nothing new to add to the dialogue about fears of technology <UNK> of 1 and 0 <UNK> technology and <UNK> and science done that anyone out there see the matrix and motion studies of people in motion ever heard of edward at least he uses exact clips of photographs of human motion studies br br this film was derivative and the score is just enough philip glass to sound like everything he's done in the past 10 years avoid this film at all costs
<START> what do you do if you're <UNK> <UNK> coming off of a blockbuster film like with some skeptical critics still relentlessly <UNK> with your astounding performance or convinced by your strong screen presence and stellar acting skills what do you do go home sit down and <UNK> no if you're <UNK> <UNK> you sign yourself up for the next strong period piece that comes along and continue to prove yourself worthy of all the praise kudos great scripts and equally great roles and that's just what she did with and in <UNK> a passion where she stars and shines as a young widow who causes controversy way ahead of her time directed by who later goes on to direct her in the equally stellar <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK>
<START> as a nice <UNK> to one of the above comments in was in <UNK> about two weeks before the release of this movie i was approached being white to dub some of the lines of this movie in a recording studio br br while i speak german as well i was kindly asked to do all dubbing scenes in english otherwise it would be too confusing for the indian audience so therefore all germans in this movie actually speak english funny enough i did multiple characters so if you would want to actually spoil some time by watching the movie again listen carefully br br all non indian characters are only done by 4 voices
<START> i must say every time i see this movie i am deeply touched not only by the most painful four years of life but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction it is also true that getting addicted to anything such as drugs alcohol or pornography cannot only hurt you but also hurt your most important people in the world your family since family is the 1 <UNK> in the asian culture it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him her this is actually the first chinese movie that i actually enjoy not for the fun of it but the elements surrounding it superb acting touching story great direction make this movie worth watching what stands out the most is that and his family act out the story themselves instead of having some b movie actor trying to imitate the real person it shows the <UNK> of the movie
<START> because that's what hell ride pretty much is larry bishop and tarantino <UNK> on the money with the promise to deliver a movie sometime down the line i'm all for fake <UNK> and booze as much as the next guy but did we really need the movie really there's nothing worse than the <UNK> second hand <UNK> of an old trend and i'm not even talking about 70's <UNK> cinema because hell ride has none of the raw and <UNK> feel of the era it <UNK> to pay homage to no this is slick and glossy mtv hollywood through and through the old trend i'm talking about is the self <UNK> pseudo hip quirky cinematic world where tarantino meets guy ritchie and robert rodriguez all three guys were at least talented and found success for a reason hell ride is just a second hand copy <UNK> and uninspired polished to the max when it should be raw the aspect coming off forced and silly br br there's no reason for example why such a simple and utterly inane story has to be told in convoluted back and forth in time fashion it's just a post tarantino <UNK> there's also no reason why the dialogues have to be so mind numbingly pointless people <UNK> their <UNK> while saying nothing at least when travolta was talking about <UNK> in pulp fiction it felt fresh dialogues here amount to little more than pseudo macho <UNK> there's also no reason why a grating <UNK> guitar has to <UNK> over the entire movie perhaps the lowest hell ride hits is when it tries to be quasi existential there's a hilarious dream illusion scene in the desert where bishop eats <UNK> and sees colours i was half expecting an old indian to come out and offer <UNK> of wisdom br br the only saving grace of this abysmal turd is the <UNK> and <UNK> jones' monologue about his wings and maybe some of the desert exterior shots lots of <UNK> and hot scantily clad babes now that's something i can get behind but a movie they don't make everything else is just an empty shell an imitation of other infinitely more talented <UNK>
<START> the movie features another exceptional collaboration between director william <UNK> and cinematographer <UNK> the first after worked on citizen kane but the talent of both these men was focused on achieving a perfectly crafted movie understood in the good old american sense as a great story the technical aspects of the movie are covered so as the viewer gets absorbed into the action that takes place on the screen without <UNK> to the power of the image technique is seen as a vehicle of representation unlike in citizen kane where welles' <UNK> style almost drew the attention from the story to the way the story was told one of my favorite moves with deep focus in this film is the drama conveyed by the returning home <UNK> of homer and al if <UNK> girl comes towards him perfectly in focus al goes over to his wife also perfectly in focus this is a brilliant move because it shows only through the use of the image the nature of these relationships as we will see them throughout the movie loves homer and she accepts him as he is <UNK> wife loves him also but she feels <UNK> to fully welcome him home also later in the film we find out that their marriage has not always been a bed of <UNK> br br <UNK> is a director whose force lies in being true to his work without feeling the need to <UNK> he wanted to show his audience how hard it was for the american soldiers returning from the war to fit into a society that either didn't understand them or treated them with contempt with a perfect cast and great dialogue and <UNK> produced a movie that will forever be the <UNK> for any other returning home movie the three hours which <UNK> with the rough cut because the test audience back then never felt for a moment that the action was slow and indeed every scene from the film seems perfectly justified the whole thing is constructed beautifully every character gets a fair amount of exposure nothing is left to chance and it is quite pitiful that hollywood nowadays never manages to bring so much character conflict to the screen explores the depth of the american way of life of the american family and society to an extent that makes other movies look like the children's hour
<START> <UNK> fans don't be fooled he only plays a cameo in this movie and that's it this movie loses an extra point for that <UNK> i think <UNK> has a total of about 2 very short scenes and 2 very short voice overs br br the female lead for this film is way above this poor material in looks and talent she's great this movie is a dog and she's wasted on it the story is of a lawyer hoping for that <UNK> one day at the firm getting <UNK> into having to <UNK> the <UNK> niece across country they have several encounters on the road with various <UNK> and that is the vehicle for a variety of skits and the dude that played <UNK> dynamite is thrown in the mix as a side character for good measure br br this is a road trip where extreme circumstances put our repressed hero to the test and he slowly winds up <UNK> up a little bit by the end of the movie ah isn't love grand <UNK> <UNK> br br only watch this film if you want to see a hot chick be annoying to a <UNK> in a truck for an hour and half
<START> i'm probably one of the few people who defend and even enjoy <UNK> the project that put todd on the map if that is indeed where he is i appreciated that someone had the guts to take on dennis cooper and not back away from the material fairly rolls around in it judging from what he's done since then he's well suited for that type of material and should probably stick to it a would be teen coming out film is so misguided in so many ways it becomes unintentional comedy and i'm disappointed i have to report that br br first off our hero the high school senior joe is far too old in appearance to be playing 18 when we later meet a man who is supposed to be <UNK> teacher it's confusing as the <UNK> faced guy looks much younger than the student he's teaching <UNK> mother looks younger than he does and doesn't act any older either second in <UNK> opening scenes he looked like he was either playing or actually experiencing mental challenges to his credit he got better as the film went on and i figured out he was playing young but it just wasn't working it was weird br br it's 15 minutes in before anything is revealed about who what and where these people are and why we should care the second scene in the film is an extended bit of business in a men's toilet room that considering where the story goes later is absolutely superfluous the subplot with the teacher goes nowhere at all even as a <UNK> of passage for our young hero one minute joe is <UNK> trying his hand at bathroom <UNK> sex a scene so un erotic it makes you truly wonder what anyone sees in the practice the next minute he's an expert at sexual blackmail and violent double crossing this is followed by an extended scene with the character we'll later learn is andrew and that's about all we learn about him other than he's apparently gay but not out yet br br there's a lot <UNK> in to the 1 <UNK> running time which is about 20 minutes too long i can't imagine how it played with the mind numbingly long and pointless deleted scenes of joe walking around a sub plot <UNK> from gods and monsters with an aged <UNK> who <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of nothing played by an actor who obviously can't remember his lines he is conveniently <UNK> with in a way dickens might have come up with on a slow week a mix n match almost four way between the boys and their girlfriends a gay bashing toilet tramp a would be wise <UNK> in the form of a <UNK> queen and hasn't the <UNK> queen suddenly taken over the role of the hooker with the heart of gold as most tired <UNK> type who exists only to be <UNK> blackmail <UNK> murder alcohol <UNK> and abuse of <UNK> music <UNK> for soundtrack recording br br what you will not find in this movie are any interior establishing master shots we're expected to imagine we're in an airport <UNK> store office and <UNK> as all the scenes in these locations consist of close ups and poorly edited to convey the idea of locales that the production must not have been able to afford one thing they were able to get appears to have been an actual gay bar either it's the worst bar in the world or there are only about 5 gay men in <UNK> as the bar never has any <UNK> in it another good chuckle came when the actors were supposed to be yelling over dance music that very obviously wasn't coming from the <UNK> but was just more of the <UNK> loop music of the score br br plots and characters come and go emotions are <UNK> and the dialog clearly inspired by dennis cooper is film speak meaning no humans actually talk this way since we aren't given any information about these characters it's impossible to care about what happens to them it's as if joe et al appear out of the <UNK> one day and might simply <UNK> to exist once the credits roll certainly the character of <UNK> sister a <UNK> jennifer grey who is <UNK> crazy seems to just simply stop we never know where she is in la or what her problem is but again does it matter visually the film looks very good at times more a testament to new developments in hi <UNK> video than anything i suspect the editing is pretty clunky though there was one great edit joe is posing naked and says i wanted to play sports but and we cut to a shot revealing his butt ha ha composition is also odd at times i thought i was watching <UNK> parody of persona when the boys were talking together in bed and visually it looked as if their <UNK> were stuck together for the whole scene br br one senses is really <UNK> himself from making a <UNK> or somewhat <UNK> movie like he usually does and maybe he shouldn't have held back the <UNK> <UNK> sex fantasy worked nicely i thought though the tone was out of touch with the rest of the movie he produces and directs this sensitive coming of age story much like <UNK> gordon lewis directed films without gore porn films without sex in them i got some <UNK> laughs out of this and it wasn't boring it just wasn't very good either
<START> i do not find this show at all funny i actually think it is much worse than any of the other terrible disney channel sit <UNK> right now charlotte arnold is an interesting choice to play <UNK> because she can't act the jokes on this show are terribly unfunny and it makes it even worse when the only cast member that has a little bit and i mean little bit of acting talent is justin <UNK> as <UNK> brother hal <UNK> richards and michael portray <UNK> friends there both really stupid and just terrible actors two words that can really describe this show is terribly corny it's corny humor that only little girls find funny because their brains have not developed yet now i've explained my hatred for the acting and the horrible humor what's next the whole premise of the show is a stupid idea she changed again not so an ben loving and suddenly nobody <UNK> her it's moronic in <UNK> i hate this show however little girls who do not have a concept of funny will enjoy it so i guess that's what they're going for over quality although i can say as much as the first season is clearly better than the second br br bottom line just don't watch any of it br br my rating awful show tv g 30 mins
<START> ok i have to admit that i quite enjoyed house of the dead despite its well documented <UNK> this however was the worst film i have seen since demons at the door compared to the effects are vastly superior however the plot is weak the acting reminiscent of everyone's favourite the porn film and the decisions and actions of the characters consistently verge on the moronic i feel like trying out uwe <UNK> latest cinematic <UNK> just to get some sense of perspective over i am not suggesting that he is really the cure more a case of a different disease but when your senses have been insulted in such an <UNK> manner the only way is up ok there it is i have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is house of the dead 2
<START> spoilers actually based on the novel the brick <UNK> about a gay man who was murdered by a <UNK> on leave because of his sexual <UNK> the movie <UNK> is about a violently anti <UNK> <UNK> who because of his own failures and <UNK> in life takes it out on those of the jewish <UNK> whom he obviously feels threatened by br br getting himself <UNK> up at a local in d c <UNK> sober us <UNK> robert ryan spots joseph samuel sam and starts to get a bit overly yet <UNK> friendly with him it seems that <UNK> is a bit <UNK> off at because he's talking to his best friend and <UNK> buddy arthur mitchell george cooper samuel is also getting through which the <UNK> <UNK> can't to the sensitive young <UNK> who's into the arts he's an artist and painter on the outside about war wwii the war that just ended as well as the shaky peace if that's what it is with the dawn of atomic bomb that's now following it in this very dangerous and unstable world what really <UNK> <UNK> more then anything else about is that he's obviously jewish that more then anything else is enough reason for the racist <UNK> to want to do in br br <UNK> mitchell to join him and his lady friend miss lewis <UNK> at his apartment to have a couple of drinks and continue the very deep and stimulating conversation that they started at the bar this has a what seems like very jealous and feeling hurt and rejected <UNK> together with his also <UNK> but somewhat clueless in what <UNK> plans for are friend and fellow <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> steve <UNK> later that night go <UNK> to place br br with the party already ended with mitchell and miss lewis gone the two very drunk <UNK> <UNK> crash the place the fact that in <UNK> sick and anti <UNK> mind stole mitchell away from him had him whip himself up into a white hot frenzy <UNK> and <UNK> break into home <UNK> his well <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> taking a couple of <UNK> against strong <UNK> of very <UNK> and <UNK> and spirits which is very unlike the watered down and cheap booze that the <UNK> <UNK> is used to <UNK> this all soon lead to a violent and brutal assault on by the angry psychotic and drunk <UNK> with <UNK> out cold on the <UNK> from all the <UNK> he consumed who beats the poor and innocent man to death br br the movie <UNK> then goes into a long and tedious since it's obvious from the start who killer is investigation into why a wounded and <UNK> wwii veteran who got the purple heart in the battle of <UNK> was murdered with <UNK> acting like he's really interested yeah sure in finding killer which in reality is himself this so called <UNK> action on <UNK> part in order to throw off suspicion on himself that he may be the man who killed him br br <UNK> is so <UNK> and even for someone who <UNK> considers himself to be very smart stupid in him constantly opening up his big and <UNK> out anti <UNK> and racist <UNK> and <UNK> about the murdered that only throws suspicion on himself and no one else i guess that guy just couldn't help it br br it's not enough that <UNK> murdered who in his sick mind was one of them he even murders his friend the scared to death in being <UNK> in murder <UNK> who in <UNK> racist way of thinking is one of us just because he was afraid <UNK> would talk to the police in order to save his own sorry neck and thus have the spotlight put on in death br br it doesn't take that long for the detective on the case capt <UNK> robert young to see through obvious lies and <UNK> and then has him set up by having another <UNK> friend of his <UNK> william <UNK> who was the butt of all his dumb and racist <UNK> jokes set the arrogant creep up this has <UNK> coming back to the scene of his crime where he murdered <UNK> where a trap has been set up for him that was all capt <UNK> needed to get <UNK> to panic when <UNK> saw that the <UNK> was up and make a run for it straight into the <UNK> of a police <UNK> br br dated a bit now but very hard hitting back in <UNK> when it was released <UNK> addressed the horrors of anti <UNK> when it at the time was kept under the covers and out of sight in almost every post wwii hollywood movie about the <UNK> of racism in the us and in europe even after the second world war and with what happened to the jews in it when it should have been given the very full and honest <UNK> to the movie going public that it so rightfully deserved
<START> anthony <UNK> and sophia loren are absolutely gorgeous in this <UNK> <UNK> western that alone however doesn't help a ridiculous story with countless historically incorrect elements br br <UNK> is convincing as the 70 something <UNK> <UNK> an <UNK> who <UNK> to see his <UNK> birthday his wild dancing at a party he gives for his neighbors will make anyone take notice this guy is six always <UNK> bible <UNK> he demands respect while driving sons and friends away with his self righteous <UNK> and emotional <UNK> br br the love affair between <UNK> and loren at first appears absurd but becomes believable near the end there is plenty of drama but not enough to feel good about clearly written for the stage this story was dated even when it was filmed <UNK> <UNK> my bonnie in the <UNK> although the song wasn't composed until br br critics knocking sophia <UNK> command of the english language are rather petty i found her english flawless and completely <UNK> as a <UNK> loren speaks a distinct <UNK> that often had to be dubbed into proper italian her accent however hardly affects how she speaks english as a first generation german american i can appreciate the efforts of those who learn english as a second or even third or fourth language br br desire under the <UNK> is a drama or even a tragedy in the classic sense for my enjoyment is was missing a logical story and an overall pay off for the time invested fans of the stars won't want to miss it others however tune in at your own risk
<START> respected western auteur <UNK> <UNK> is woefully out of place with this choppy modern day cops and robbers story that suffers from a strong lack of emotional believability <UNK> seems to have rehearsal time and settled for the first take as leads joe <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> put little effort into their roles delivering lines <UNK> and without energy br br mild mannered employee leon <UNK> <UNK> works as an inside man on a bank job that goes bad and gets his wife killed in the process he escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the wife of the detective who killed his hundreds of cops are <UNK> to keep him from getting to the home of the intended who has been moved to another location but wouldn't you know in the films final moments we have <UNK> <UNK> feet behind the victim who thought somehow that taking a bus back to the house was a sound move while a company of cops observe and <UNK> over what action to take sound preposterous you should see it it's all of that and more br br <UNK> <UNK> camera work does a decent job of bringing noir to the <UNK> but the editing is <UNK> and <UNK> and it <UNK> the film of its suspense and pace as <UNK> <UNK> corey is the best thing in the film managing to evoke great sympathy as he transitions from gentle soul to murderer these attributes aside killer uniformly fails in construction and execution making its message clear go western old <UNK>
<START> for those that might send me nasty e <UNK> <UNK> it there is a trend in hollywood where those that create overly quirky movies are instantly <UNK> to criticism garden state tends to be one of those movies br br sure <UNK> star of a rather overrated sitcom surprises people with some talent behind the camera but that doesn't warrant the kind of praise that a film like this has been receiving the story is often times too thin and shallow to provide any real insight people have compared this film to the graduate but those type of people are the types that try to independent cinema indie films are subject to the same hit and miss mentality that typically hits the studio films but people seemed to have forgotten that there are far more bad indie films than good ones garden state isn't atrocious but its isn't great br br first off the film is too quick resulting in a rather fast <UNK> of large into his former life after ten years people tend to act like he never left where's the <UNK> of course the situation is always solved by a quick drug <UNK> scene which i will say was portrayed rather accurately the film seem to present a lot of emotional <UNK> giving us the idea that the emotion will come up later in a more deeper and more well thought out way however it fails to deliver on those <UNK> leaving us wondering why the journey to some of his decisions and moments were quickly resolved like peter grave robbing <UNK> it wasn't completely abysmal but maybe we should stop <UNK> the film as something it isn't
<START> ok end of the story is all the kills were a joke on the main character and no one is actually dead yes i know cry wolf did it and did it well but this isn't cry wolf it's scream crap even though the characters don't apparently die we see them get stabbed to death and other ways they are killed even though these kills do not take place as anyone can see them mr director if you're gonna show people getting killed someone needs to see it if they're off camera and the character getting <UNK> killed is alone it doesn't work and until the end i liked a couple of scenes but your end ruined the whole thing br br the acting is horrid especially the kid at the beginning who really thinks he tricked his friends into believing they were playing with his dead <UNK> brains the script is less than half baked though if you're half baked you might like the movie the only reason i gave this movie a 3 is because a they actually made something b they got it released and c they shot on film yes you read right they wasted at least 5 000 on film stock for this crap sad if they'd shot <UNK> they'd had some cash for a better cast and another writer to go through the script and make it good br br i admire the fact that the director made something as most don't but the fact that he comes on talking about how original the movie is br br avoid the movie if it means buying it to see if a friend has it it might be a funny movie to borrow
