<START> this is a funny movie the bob eddie show feel of it could lead to a sequel but i doubt it will make enough money br br deniro proves he can be a great straight man again with some hilarious and spontaneous moments eddie was fun to watch working with people instead of cgi animals and <UNK> <UNK> russo well she's just fun to watch anyway and she's played her part excellent br br some wild and unusual stunts especially the garbage truck scene this was worth seeing in the theater we needed a good laugh and got many from the movie and the great out takes at the end do not leave at the start of the credits br br at least a 7
<START> leaving aside the <UNK> and <UNK> of the film mentioned by other viewers i must say that it seemed to me a film about power which is in my opinion one of the most <UNK> <UNK> i saw the drama of an emperor and people it seems to me that the director wanted to pose a question of what the benefit of nation is and what the price of happiness for all is is there justification for the <UNK> benefit and happiness how much can be for the <UNK> security and peaceful existence is the idea of a powerful would be empire worth <UNK> to misery and killing thousands of its citizens now it seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and seeks to learn it all the time the film runs he is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically <UNK> by the discovery of his true origin he seems to half hate his subjects for having to <UNK> his father and his love half love the people as a good emperor should no wonder his actions are controversial and emotions confused it seems to me that as another film presenting the problem of power of man over other men the film is a success
<START> this is a really great film in the pulp fiction genre with a touch of film noir thrown in truly one of emma <UNK> best performances to date this film has everything it's well written well directed beautifully films and has some great performances i don't know why it didn't catch on it's spectacular
<START> this is my first <UNK> <UNK> film i saw the film on tv in its hindi version with its <UNK> character presented as i also note that it is <UNK> who <UNK> the <UNK> trial by fire in the film and not <UNK> yet what i loved about the film was its screenplay by ms <UNK> not her direction the characters big and small were well developed and seemed <UNK> towards the end somewhat like the end of an <UNK> woman they are brave women surrounded by cardboard men and one cardboard man <UNK> seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him carrying his <UNK> mother he seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond <UNK> and to religion br br ms <UNK> seems to <UNK> as a director however compared to most indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant as she cannot use her script to go beyond the <UNK> joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the chinese <UNK> minority in the social <UNK> of india she even <UNK> the film to her mother and daughter not her father yet her <UNK> of <UNK> days with both her parents in a <UNK> field compare her to <UNK> ali and she is <UNK> by these giants given her competent canadian production team and financial resources <UNK> film of two <UNK> ladies in an indian middle class household may be <UNK> to some but merely captures the <UNK> of middle class homes that does not seem to <UNK> for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space <UNK> and films have touched parallel themes in india but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of <UNK> br br ms <UNK> ms <UNK> mr <UNK> and mr <UNK> are credible but not outstanding ms <UNK> is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a brilliance notably absent in this film ms <UNK> due to her screen presence rather than her acting <UNK> all in all the film's strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema i am sure ms <UNK> can <UNK> her writing talents in her future screenplays
<START> i watched this movie recently and fell in love with it i loved the storyline and the actors it has a little of everything i was completely taken by the unfolding of the story it has so many surprises along the way i highly recommend it in fact i loved it so much that i ran out and bought the book i felt i had to read it in order to appreciate the art in the writing behind the movie i also wanted to make sure i didn't miss anything that was in the book but kept out of the movie i recommend people who love the movie to read the book because there is enough difference in the book especially in the second episode to want to read it it has become my favorite movie i am now a sarah waters and <UNK> cassidy fan
<START> one of the most pleasant surprises of this early 3 strip technicolor short was that a ballet dancer that appears here was named maria i half wondered if blake <UNK> was <UNK> the character played by <UNK> <UNK> in a shot in the dark after this now forgotten performer though the spelling of the <UNK> character's <UNK> was actually i watched this on youtube mainly to see an early judy garland appearance as we watch her in profile with her two older sisters singing la <UNK> that was the highlight for me which otherwise showed some dances like that of ms that were enjoyable and some lame comedy between andy <UNK> as a great bull fighter yeah right and buster keaton as a bull owner who provides one that is obviously a man in animal costume only funny part of those two is when they cry with buster providing <UNK> to bull during the sad part of la <UNK> also lame was seeing ted <UNK> without his stooges dealing with a <UNK> who keeps <UNK> <UNK> for other movie stars <UNK> himself didn't know <UNK> had left the marx brothers since he puts four between the and marx speaking of a marx it was interesting seeing <UNK> without his wig though he is wearing a hat to hide his bald head also interesting was seeing <UNK> <UNK> among the <UNK> in the beginning though i also recognized toby wing from her part in murder at the <UNK> last year at least when <UNK> pete smith identified her oh and smith himself wasn't funny with his wise guy narration other famous stars you may or may not recognize are also in cameos and not all are m g m contract players either so with all that said la de santa barbara is worth a look for anyone curious about judy <UNK> early film appearances or the early use of 3 strip technicolor
<START> this movie is powerful i watched this movie at 3 00 am and i was suppose to be at work at 6 00 am needless to say i was late to work i could not bring myself to get up off my bed to go to work this is the most powerful movie that i have seen in a long time and that made me cry and feel the pain of the family i think did a wonderful job of directing this film i agree with the previous comments from other views that this is the only movie that i have seen that has brought the war home and showed what a family had to go through what a veteran went through it is almost heart breaking to think that back then people just thought you could come home from a life changing experience and be the same person you were before you left kathy bates reminded me of my mother in a way i believe she really showed how women felt and acted back then i am surprised that this film wasn't up for more awards
<START> beware the scottish play in his riveting and harrowing opera <UNK> <UNK> returns to classic form <UNK> the <UNK> he lost while filming convoluted and delirious psycho <UNK> like <UNK> and <UNK> indeed <UNK> on a simple narrative that is <UNK> by <UNK> set pieces <UNK> brutal murder sequences and <UNK> photography the film feels like the <UNK> we once knew only real <UNK> is its lack of a score by <UNK> who provided unusual iconic and timeless music for many of <UNK> greatest films the opera <UNK> used here are wonderful however br br the production is filled out by several competent actors while she's no jessica <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> manages enough <UNK> and compassion to grasp the role of the tortured heroine ian <UNK> is interesting as horror film <UNK> turned opera director <UNK> and daria is fantastic as always even in her relatively brief role watch the making of <UNK> on the dvd for a hilarious interview with about her role clearly <UNK> and <UNK> over the end of her relationship with <UNK> fans of stage fright another excellent 1987 giallo directed by <UNK> who served as the second unit director for opera will barely recognize the final girl from that film barbara as a stage manager here i think it's the glasses that do it br br with me it's often the little things that matter and <UNK> fascination obsession with <UNK> nightmarish images makes him my ideal filmmaker opera is full of minor details that left me <UNK> for instance i love that we never see the great <UNK> face i also love the scene where the killer is <UNK> the tip of his her deadly sharp <UNK> across a television screen showing <UNK> performance as lady <UNK> finally i defy even the most <UNK> slasher veterans not to cringe as the pin <UNK> are placed over <UNK> eyes br br in short opera is a clean tense and taut thriller with its solid performances <UNK> focus and <UNK> cinematography it begs to be in the same league as deep red and the bird with the crystal <UNK> might opera be the last great giallo
<START> a made for television version of the heart of darkness seemed like a good way to add more insight to the book well that was the wrong <UNK> the movie made it even worse i was highly disappointed about almost everything in the movie i hoped that the movie would possibly help put the pieces of the book together that i didn't comprehend but it did no such thing it still left me confused and hanging it is one of those movies that makes one feel like it would be more fun to watch the grass grow instead of watching the movie not exactly anyone's cup of tea it was an overall dreadful boring and slow movie br br to begin with nicolas <UNK> must have been pretty desperate when he decided that he wanted to <UNK> the task of making the already boring book into a movie it's a guaranteed loss it's like going into a knife fight but forgetting the knife on the kitchen counter the person is going to lose and in the case the person was <UNK> all i've heard about the movie are bad things and the movie deserves those bad things to be said about it from watching the movie i got the impression that the people who made the movie just <UNK> over the book to get the key points br br furthermore although the movie did follow the main story line of the book it left out quite a few details and it also changed the ending i am not a fan of that <UNK> left out when <UNK> and his crew came across the russian <UNK> camp and at that camp they found the book also it didn't show when at the camp they came across the sign that says wood for you hurry up approach <UNK> conrad <UNK> also at the end of the book <UNK> dies on the boat not at the inner station br br on the contrary nicolas <UNK> did one good thing while he was making his movie he managed to hire some pretty decent actors to play in the movie for instance he acquired tim roth and john <UNK> both of whom would later go on to have successful careers in doing so he added a little something to the horrible movie also though i am ripping his book to <UNK> i do have some respect for him because it takes a lot of courage to try to take on the heart of darkness it isn't exactly the <UNK> novel to portray into a film a <UNK> effort though in conclusion if for whatever reason someone actually wants to watch this movie i suggest the reading of heart of darkness first this way you'll get all of the scenes that were left out of the movie and you won't be completely lost when you watch it but i really suggest you don't read the book and that you really don't watch the movie both will be a complete waste of your time trust me i was forced to do both by my english teacher and now i wish that the book and the movie didn't exist if either the book or the movie are pursued good luck
<START> first let me say that although i generally appreciate mike <UNK> work i've been merely tepid in my response to office space king of the hill and <UNK> and <UNK> i generally prefer more intelligent comedy and <UNK> lies the irony with respect to <UNK> br br in a future world where the <UNK> of <UNK> and views <UNK> instincts and intellectual <UNK> are the <UNK> of a chaotic messy semi mad max semi blade runner society where every trailer trash guy's fantasy becomes reality a man with even average intelligence is threatening and accused of talking gay and the mob mentality takes over and this world is also incredibly funny br br yes it's obvious that <UNK> jr <UNK> <UNK> and executives will be horrified at the twisted values given their products in the year br br there were some missed opportunities with the film and the relationship between the time <UNK> the other being an average intelligence woman who's worried about her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> could have been stronger the chemistry is there and there don't seem to be too many women in the future br br i did leave with a grin on my face but the experience is a bit better than the memories thus it's my kind of popcorn film and it will be fun to <UNK> on video recommended <UNK> stay through the credits for an extra scene
<START> let's face it you know what to expect when you tune into a post 1990 corey <UNK> film there are probably boobs guns and cars saying that there is more to this movie than just naked ladies i'm sorry to say <UNK> it's mainly people getting themselves killed in a variety of unusual and as the name suggests often ways i love crappy horror and i love this film if you don't you probably wont but i think it's worth most people giving it a go it's not so crappy that it'll ruin your weekend or anything all in all if its mindless good fun a bit of corpse loving and an 80's childhood superstar your in the mood for then you've come to the right place its a cracker
<START> admittedly alex has become a little but they are still for me the greatest rock trio ever i <UNK> recommend this dvd to any fan br br i was very disappointed that they canceled their planned recent <UNK> gig <UNK> and regret not making an effort to see them elsewhere the dvd is a small <UNK> the greatest <UNK> to <UNK> a proper dvd <UNK> setup br br naive perhaps but i still don't understand the significance of the <UNK> on stage i would be grateful for any <UNK> br br cheers
<START> br br this movie is <UNK> incredibly unfunny it makes any man want to cry the cliché are put on <UNK> than 5 year old <UNK> <UNK> and in such a way that it actually sucks humour out of your heart every single joke was badly timed and wouldn't have been funny if it were timed correctly br br don't see this movie there's a real chance you'll never be able to enjoy going to comedies again ever
<START> i was in blockbuster and i saw a film called dark <UNK> the cover art looked great the plot wasn't that bad and the <UNK> you <UNK> what you <UNK> made the movie look pretty good but i was dumb that day because i did something i should have never done i rented a straight to video independent horror film walking out with my much better <UNK> i went home popped dark <UNK> in the dvd player and it began i figured i would watch the trailer after the film was done bad idea but went ahead and watched it anyway now to the review possible spoilers first off the acting by the kids sucks and the scene when the 2 main characters are talking the lighting sucks and the buildings even look fake now they go to this house where sean i think he's the main character i don't care relatives lived there all of a sudden one by one they all start getting killed by gasp a killer scarecrow <UNK> the scarecrow is obviously the definition of low budget and the scenes where the scarecrow is <UNK> looks so fake it's hilarious it makes dinosaur noises and everything and then at the end they shoot the scarecrow with a gun that is red for god's sake and looks like it was purchased at a local family dollar and it pauses for a while and then gasp blows up br br save yourself some time i'm telling you this movie sucks if you need to pass an hour and a half look at the wall because looking at the wall is a fun compared to this disaster it is quite funny though br br overall grade f if there was anything lower f than i would give it that
<START> well i am the target market i loved it furthermore my husband also a <UNK> with strong memories of the '60s liked it a lot too i haven't read the book so i went into it neutral i was very pleasantly surprised it's now on our highly recommended video list br br
<START> if you've seen the trailer for this movie you pretty much know what to expect because what you see here is what you get and even if you haven't seen the previews it won't take you long to pick up on what you're in for specifically a good time and plenty of laughs from this clever satire of reality <UNK> shows and buddy <UNK> movies showtime ' directed by tom <UNK> starring robert de niro and eddie murphy br br mitch preston de niro is a detective with the l a p d and he's good at what he does but working a case one night things suddenly go south when another cop <UNK> <UNK> murphy inadvertently <UNK> a television news crew shows up and mitch loses his cool which results in a <UNK> by the television station that's going to cost the department some big bucks except that they may be able to get around it thanks to chase <UNK> russo who works for the station and likes what she sees in mitch enough to pitch an idea to her boss for a <UNK> cop show that would feature none other than mitch preston whom chase sees as a real life dirty harry ' br br her boss likes the idea and gives chase the green light now all she has to do is convince mitch to participate which shouldn't be too hard since the station has agreed to drop the <UNK> if he will do the show but mitch is a cop not an actor and he wants nothing to do with any of it that is until he has a heart to heart with his boss captain frankie <UNK> who puts <UNK> future into <UNK> perspective for him and just like that the show is on oh yes there's one more thing for the show mitch is going to need a partner and who do you suppose they're going to come up with for that let's put it this way <UNK> <UNK> is more than one of the usual suspects br br this is <UNK> second film as a director his first being shanghai <UNK> ' also a comedy and he's definitely showing a <UNK> for the genre from the opening frames he <UNK> a pace that keeps the story moving right along and he allows his stars to make the most of their respective talents and personal strengths including their impeccable timing with stars like de niro and murphy <UNK> of course had a leg up on this project to begin with but he's the one who keeps it on track <UNK> that he knows what works achieving just the right blend of physical comedy and action and <UNK> the subtleties of the dialogue to great effect br br there isn't a more natural actor in the business than de niro and he steps into <UNK> skin like he was born to it and after years of doing hard edge cutting drama in which he turned in one remarkable performance after another with such films as analyze this ' meet the parents' and now this one he has firmly established his <UNK> for doing comedy as well mitch is not an especially complex character he is in fact something of an guy but <UNK> lies the challenge for the actor to make him believable to make him seem like the guy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community and on all counts de niro succeeds he's mitch the guy you run into at the <UNK> store or the bank or say good <UNK> to on your way to work who likes to watch the game on tv and has a life just like you and me who happens to make his living by being a cop it's the character mitch has to be to make this film work because it makes the ordinary guy in extraordinary angle credible it's one of those role and work that is often wrongly <UNK> out of hand because it looks so easy and of course this is what makes de niro so exceptional he does make it look easy and he does it with facility br br as <UNK> <UNK> eddie murphy turns in a winning performance as well and it's a role that fits him like the proverbial <UNK> <UNK> is a cop but also an aspiring actor and a bad one and it gives murphy the opportunity to play on the over <UNK> side of his personality <UNK> in enough by <UNK> however to keep him from <UNK> over the top into jim carrey territory which works perfectly for this character and this film from his melodramatic take on a part during an audition to his throwing out of one liners delivered by looking directly into the camera which as far as he's concerned isn't even there while filming the <UNK> show murphy's a riot and he has a chemistry with de niro that really <UNK> which is not unexpected as this is another of de <UNK> many talents his ability to connect with and bring out the best in his co stars all of whom evidence will support are better at their craft after having worked with him including the likes of meryl streep christopher walken and ed harris just to name a few most importantly this is a part that allows murphy to <UNK> at what he does best and he certainly makes the most of it br br russo makes the most of her role as chase too a character who isn't much of a stretch artistically but whom she presents delightfully with a strong believable performance and william shatner playing himself absolutely steals a couple of scenes as the director of the show br br the supporting cast includes de niro annie <UNK> <UNK> vargas and james camera man well crafted and delivered is a comedy that's exactly what it is meant to be pure entertainment that provides plenty of laughs and a pleasant couple of hours that will have you <UNK> for some time after it's the magic of the movies 8 10 br br br br br br
<START> this movie could be <UNK> to comfort food for the soul anyone who has ever tried and tried to save a relationship could relate to this movie so many parts of it are so hilarious and so many parts are so <UNK> true it's not perfect in its production or even its dialog but the story is unique which is saying a lot for modern romantic comedies luke wilson is bland at best but heather graham does an exceptional job in my opinion give it a try despite the trite looking dvd cover the character of brings a lot of issues up in our culture of self service she asks us if commitment is really for the other person or ourselves truly it is ourselves following through on promises anywhere from marriage to an <UNK> for a friend is a great feeling anymore our word is nothing but a <UNK> <UNK> of smoke is like a wake up call we must be conscious of our words and <UNK> they mean more than we think at the same time we must not commit to someone who is incapable of doing the same
<START> alright so maybe the <UNK> of jay leno and david <UNK> are not spot on but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they operate behind the screen bob <UNK> and treat williams are as warren <UNK> and micheal br br the movie doesn't go for joke and punchline but it is still funny kathy bates in particular is amazing as <UNK> manager br br funny amazing interesting very watchable this is a good tv movie
<START> in everything is <UNK> <UNK> wood plays jonathan <UNK> a jewish american who is looking for the woman who saved his grandfather during wwii in a sense the woman that saved his entire family br br this is a heart felt tale about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey a stranger in a strange land so to speak jonathan is not entirely prepared for this adventure he sticks out like a sore thumb in the <UNK> he would probably stick out like a sore thumb anywhere but what he discovers is more much more than he anticipated this movie will make you laugh and will make you cry <UNK> wood is really good in this film based on the novel by jonathan <UNK> <UNK> br br from someone i talked to this movie is somewhat different from the book a book i gather is really good nevertheless this is a good movie it has something for everyone and i really enjoyed it can someone say oscar
<START> what can i say an excellent end to an excellent series it never quite got the exposure it deserved in asia but by far the best cop show with the best writing and the best cast on <UNK> ever the end of a great era sorry to see you go
<START> this movie is widely as being a copy of the will smith feature <UNK> that movie was dull br br this movie isn't so much dull as unbearable govinda looks way past his prime he is not at his best doing roles like this it is similarly unconvincing as his performance in <UNK> <UNK> br br salman khan is at his eye <UNK> best and that's in the few scenes where he remembers to put clothes on it could only have been through <UNK> that this eye scenes could be saved from the trash bin of any movie's cutting floor br br another case of bollywood embarrassing itself with it's shameless <UNK> another case of the bollywood audience majority embarrassing themselves by making this a hit
<START> plot in a nutshell <UNK> voice of eva <UNK> is the well polished single mother cat of three little <UNK> when their owner the wealthy elderly woman known as <UNK> <UNK> realizes that her time is running out she decides to write up her will leaving everything she has to her cats which will then go to her butler edgar when the cats pass on edgar <UNK> this and is deeply offended by the idea that the cats would get everything before him and plots to destroy <UNK> and her <UNK> he drops sleeping <UNK> in their <UNK> one night and then leaves them stranded in the french countryside out of their element <UNK> and her <UNK> <UNK> a street smart stray cat known as thomas voice of phil harris who did the voice of the big bear in the jungle book after making a pass at <UNK> unaware that she is a single mother decides to <UNK> them back home with <UNK> genuinely falling for as the usual <UNK> surrogate family bond develops chaos and mayhem ensues culminating in a violent clash between his brother cats from the streets and edgar also features appearances by british <UNK> american southern <UNK> dogs what they were doing in france is anyone's guess a mouse who sounds a lot like the rabbit from alice in wonderland he was in fact voiced by the same guy who voiced <UNK> the <UNK> and a horse br br sometimes slow paced but still enjoyable disney venture features the memorable everybody wants to be a cat musical piece sung by the late <UNK> <UNK> better known to 1980s fans as the voice of jazz on transformers of course if this was being made now it would probably be a dark social commentary on class division represented by the <UNK> between well <UNK> well fed <UNK> and the street born
<START> this is without a doubt one of my favorite columbo episodes ever the acting is very well done the music is very catchy the script is ingenious and the direction is fabulous br br peter falk who acts brilliantly in every columbo episodes acts particularly well in this episode br br also great performances from stephen gary alan <UNK> and robert <UNK> br br the ending is absolutely brilliant and i love the way columbo describes it br br this is a columbo movie that won't go <UNK>
<START> don't waste your time and money on it it's not quite as bad as <UNK> by the same director but that's not saying much
<START> terry <UNK> andy garcia catches up with danny ocean and his team and demands that they <UNK> the money that they stole from him in <UNK> 11 plus interest he holds back from violent action however as he is under the <UNK> of the world's greatest thief the night fox the team then have to pull off a series of <UNK> to pay <UNK> back whilst testing their abilities against the night fox who wishes to maintain his position as the greatest thief ever put simply this film is a complete mess the masses may argue that it is cool and that clooney and pitt put in great performances but these are the same people who have a <UNK> to hello magazine and think that david beckham has the potential to be a great actor the story is convoluted it is not complex or clever and it does not have intelligent twists and turns it is just a complete mess that <UNK> out in multiple directions with the hope that the audience will think it is cool and intelligent hello magazine readers any respectable movie watcher will however see the film for the farce that it is whilst <UNK> 11 wasn't a great film it had a decent pace was stylish and had some decent twists and turns this movie loses its way very quickly and then basically gives up it is as if the director and cast said to themselves hey this isn't really working out lets just have a laugh indeed the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves but i was not i will not delve into the plot as its confused evolution does not warrant any examination the addition of catherine zeta jones is largely annoying the scenes where julia roberts <UNK> herself with bruce willis <UNK> a cameo role whilst mildly amusing appear to be a desperate move to keep the audience interested the movie is so full of plot holes that it as if arnie has <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> into the film studio credit can only be given to some scenes where the night fox uses to <UNK> a heist against the back drop of some funky music but this is hardly justification to watch the movie the final scene features the team in a nonsensical drunken <UNK> this accurately sums up the movie stick with the original
<START> big fat liar comes as a welcome shallow but welcome breath of fresh air after one too many films featuring <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pets on acid jokes and <UNK> gags after all see spot run max big move and snow dogs had <UNK> the <UNK> spiral of kiddie movie making worse is the realization that the young audience would later be <UNK> by the offerings of not another teen movie and <UNK> written by <UNK> producers dan schneider and brian robbins who <UNK> co starred on the '80s sitcom head of the class the film stars frankie as jason who's always ready with a good lie to get out of <UNK> where's the english paper dad <UNK> on a swedish <UNK> his teacher sandra oh issues an ultimatum turn in the paper by the end of the day or take summer school jason <UNK> out a story called big fat liar and is struck en route to school by a <UNK> carrying <UNK> hollywood producer marty wolf paul <UNK> wolf gives him a ride but jason leaves his paper behind no one will hear the truth this time and dad tells him he's lost his trust br br months later jason and best friend amanda <UNK> see a movie preview for big fat liar and head off to los angeles to <UNK> havoc on <UNK> life all to get a confession that he stole <UNK> paper to make the film they even gain the sympathy of some of <UNK> abused employees including his assistant amanda <UNK> former <UNK> donald <UNK> movie star white playing himself and stunt <UNK> a much aged lee <UNK> br br because big fat liar is without the edge that his sitcom malcolm in the middle is known for is easy to root for but doesn't have much to work with likewise for <UNK> who <UNK> her own <UNK> <UNK> like sketch show on <UNK> all the <UNK> is given to <UNK> whose eyes <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> with every <UNK> insult br br the film gets <UNK> just by attempting the high road and should be enjoyed by its target audience especially since most of the high <UNK> occur on the universal studios lot but here's one head <UNK> the message is that it pays to tell the truth but didn't we just see jason getting to his <UNK> by telling white lies throughout the film well at least there's no <UNK>
<START> simply delightful <UNK> feature from nick park and company <UNK> such film <UNK> as king kong and the wolf man has wallace and <UNK> as rabbit security finding it difficult to solve a major problem in their village a giant were rabbit is <UNK> <UNK> on the <UNK> <UNK> of the citizens what makes this even worse is that the great <UNK> festival is about to <UNK> and the citizens have all prepared <UNK> to win the top of prize what makes the situation even worse is wallace is the reason behind the whole <UNK> eating rampage he was testing out a new invention regarding taking his brain waves in an attempt to brain wash captured <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> what occurs is <UNK> as some sort of hybrid were rabbit is created in the process and it has more to do with wallace than he could ever imagine it'll be up to his loyal and <UNK> intelligent and fast thinking dog <UNK> to save the day br br this is a clever and imaginative effort from the crew behind other oscar winning <UNK> features starring wallace and <UNK> seeing good <UNK> fashioned <UNK> is refreshing considering the cgi boom that has featured rather lackluster fare here recently as the industry <UNK> out more and more mediocre product here we get a full feature with witty humor and some wild stunts featuring marvelous animation not to mention gut <UNK> sight gags
<START> watching cold mountain gave me the impression that its director anthony was deliberately trying to <UNK> himself and the own film of <UNK> that he was trying to beat was the virtually impeccable the english patient from 1996 comparing the two movies the premise is quite similar we have a passionate love affair between two people set in a <UNK> time of war and they end up treating the war more or less as a <UNK> in the background while trying to find themselves back in each other's arms again the primary plot differences are that nicole <UNK> character is not married jude <UNK> is a <UNK> and the conflict is the american civil war br br cold mountain is story wise more watered down and <UNK> than say the english patient and it's more on the level for people who want a simple love story with some kind of an exterior <UNK> causing a problem it is a shorter film which is a plus for people with less patience however it's not as spectacular or original or genuinely gripping as the english patient my only big complaint about cold mountain is astonishingly the love affair between the characters of jude law and <UNK> monroe nicole kidman amazingly their love was the least interesting thing in the picture they don't have a real relationship we don't feel any real passion coming from them and the passion that we do see is more physical than emotional i was more fascinated by the friendship between nicole kidman and oscar winner <UNK> and also jude <UNK> travels across country <UNK> <UNK> and enemy soldiers if had <UNK> the importance of the love story then he would have had i feel a better picture br br of course the movie is entertaining even if the love story is uninteresting the civil war sequences are absolutely great they are of the modern tradition that show war as horrible and <UNK> the re <UNK> of the <UNK> campaign in which tons of <UNK> was <UNK> from underground and then followed by a hand to hand battle is horrifying does not shy from showing blood and gore in an artistic and sensible manner and he's not afraid to show <UNK> of innocence and life in these scenes there are moments where women as well as men are killed <UNK> by <UNK> and there's more to it just the sound design of the movie <UNK> tension there's a scene where and another <UNK> make themselves a meal by <UNK> off the head of a dead cow we don't see the <UNK> but the sound effects of blade going through bone are sickening br br lastly i must <UNK> the cast for the performances jude law was terrific in the movie and deserved the academy award nomination he received i feel that nicole kidman deserved one as well even though her character was a bit shallow <UNK> had the most personality and screen stealing atmosphere and then there's just the bit parts that also really work to complete this <UNK> world <UNK> a horrible time in america's past br br maybe cold mountain would have been better as a war picture but it most certainly would have been spectacular like the english patient if its love story had been powered up and made more passionate by the screenwriters and director anthony as it is it's a most enjoyable picture i wasn't bored by it and i recommend it i just say that its love story though a central plot point is a little more <UNK> than it needs to be and all the stuff around it was what really worked
<START> i saw this movie as part of the <UNK> madness at set in 18th century england the plot covers the life of arthur blake from his first outing as an apprentice grave <UNK> to his final confession on the eve of his execution br br the plot moves along via a series of <UNK> involving arthur and his partner <UNK> various <UNK> characters and bizarre situations br br the first thing that strikes you about this movie is how accurately they managed to capture the look of the hammer period horrors the atmosphere is set with lots of fog laden <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scenes and excellent set costume design br br for a movie titled i sell the dead i was expecting the emphasis to be mostly on horror  don't get me wrong there are some <UNK> moments and gore but the tone is very much comedic driven by the situations the characters get themselves into and their dialog the closest comparison to the scenes between the two leads larry <UNK> and dominic <UNK> is the character interaction seen in the classic english comedies only fools and horses the two <UNK> and <UNK> and wise br br the acting is strong and the casting of very familiar faces in ron <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> lift the movie above many of the others on view in br br overall the movie offers something very different to the current crop of mainstream horror and will leave a smile on your face
<START> it was <UNK> talking to <UNK> in the flashback and if anyone is confused about her past like how did she end up in the same hospital <UNK> was in then you should know that <UNK> dying in season 2 the character will be explored more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions surrounding her br br btw great episode it had a really great cliffhanger and some interesting questions like what happened to <UNK> and lock and what about the four toe statue br br i cannot wait till season 3 lost just rules i hope all the unanswered questions will be answered i loved how they explained why the plane actually crashed <UNK> did it when he did not manage to type in the numbers in time 4 8 15 16 23 <UNK>
<START> i really enjoyed this movie for what it is a funny little film that doesn't take itself too seriously plot <UNK> are available everywhere so i won't go into details michael isn't about a complex plot anyway it just builds on a great premise and takes the viewer on a wonderful road trip br br john <UNK> performance as a chain smoking lady loving bar <UNK> pie eating angel is just perfect and who doesn't love <UNK> br br watch this if you want to have a few laughs and a overall good time highly recommended
<START> okay okay i must admit i do somewhat like peter and i'll admit this is not the best <UNK> sequel i mean yeah it had its flaws such as no <UNK> themselves but the two <UNK> that come to earth were really funny i guess they were called dark and <UNK> i enjoyed the plot of the movie and even at the end of the movie both <UNK> implied that there would be a sequel still waiting lol peter <UNK> his role as jonathan graves this time playing a detective how cute <UNK> iv may not be scary or suspenseful but it is definitely funny i thought i would comment on this movie and just say it's not that bad it is worth watching even though the <UNK> aren't in it
<START> well every scene so perfectly presented never before had i seen such a movie that has meaning in almost every scene br br well while i was watching this movie i remembered watching is also a similar kind of movie with more fun and fantasy touch these movies are both based on a same plot line but both of them are perfectly perfect in there own way and being able to create a world of their own br br red is able to <UNK> lots of thoughts in people about destiny and s and i am still thinking about it br br the story is great and the ending is a bit funny i was laughing in the end scene well funny how this three movie red white and blue are connected br br all in all a great work of art a work of a br br 10 10
<START> this wonderful 3 part bbc production is one of the <UNK> love stories that i have seen in a while the actresses display a very high level of talent especially <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> she is funny seductive and cute the love making scenes and the close up kisses are very erotic regardless of one's sexual <UNK> br br the characters are well defined and very believable i guess this is a by product of a good adaptation from a well written novel br br a truly remarkable well paced drama that picks up speed quickly after a couple of boring but necessary scenes in the beginning br br my vote 9 10
<START> i think the <UNK> of this movie was written on the piece of toilet paper no respect whatsoever to many important details which <UNK> make the movie for example the names of some serbian terrorists that i remember are and leo what kind of names are that certainly not serbian by the way what a name i laughed for days thinking about it probably an <UNK> on <UNK> and secondly there have never been any cases of terrorism done by <UNK> a journalist like the main character ought to have known that <UNK> the actors playing serbian terrorists are not even <UNK> nor do they speak <UNK> <UNK> all this aside this movie is <UNK> acted but the story is paper thin and full of holes at times it makes no sense whatsoever
<START> <UNK> a pair of cinematic references to <UNK> not only in plot but in style <UNK> a pair of references to the historic case of the <UNK> <UNK> players that survived in the by eating the dead members of their flight to <UNK> <UNK> only an excuse the movie uses to delve into the extremes men are willing to go to defeat isolation and obtain social acceptance br br the script is extremely creative and hopefully is going to leave the viewer laughing and wondering
<START> i may <UNK> from many people on this board but i enjoy watching mind of <UNK> the reason i like mind of <UNK> is the host is not afraid to speak his mind or exploit stereotypes carlos <UNK> does what we all do with our friends but are unwilling to admit and then some br br <UNK> has no problem doing jokes about any race religion sex or <UNK> while he gets a lot of <UNK> for this it is a breath of fresh air in these politically correct times <UNK> does not care if he <UNK> anyone but he is not a racist and even does jokes about his own race br br the typical format for the mind of <UNK> goes like this there will be an open skit making fun of a person or recent event <UNK> then comes out and does a 5 or 6 minute stand up where he talks about various issues the show then has 2 separate skits divided by commercials in these skits <UNK> does a variety of things such as making fun of people giving his personal opinions with a funny twist or simply doing parodies of people events or movies at the end of the show <UNK> comes out for a minute with either one final skit or something else to say br br people criticize <UNK> for <UNK> stereotypes and say his statements are overly offensive carlos only does what everyone else thinks of certain races but are afraid to say as for <UNK> being offensive he is only speaking his mind i find nothing wrong with that br br the show is not perfect the skits can be not put together the best and sometimes <UNK> does go over the line in his jokes for the most part however it is a show where the comedian says what is on his mind no matter what the consequences and presents in in a humorous matter so if you aren't afraid to laugh at stereotypes and see someone speak his mind and often say what you have wanted to say then watch mind of <UNK> however if you are easily offended you should not watch this show because you will be offended or worse yet you might even laugh
<START> i began watching this movie on t v some weeks ago but gave up after the first 10 minutes or so at the start the person on the witness protection scheme located in an isolated <UNK> becomes nervous about his exterior placed guards and then asks the guard inside the house whether he can make a <UNK> call only to discover the line has been cut br br shortly afterwards roy <UNK> as one of the <UNK> turns up and <UNK> <UNK> the witness and his wife upon which the roy <UNK> character <UNK> picks up the wall <UNK> in the kitchen a number and then speaks it is done that was it for me
<START> mr seagal has <UNK> <UNK> his already low standards even more and has now <UNK> himself in making bad movies the <UNK> has no substance what so ever in the script it's director has made an even worse job and the music and score is so <UNK> and <UNK> that you just don't know whether to laugh or cry already 10 minutes into the movie you just want to turn it off however considering steven <UNK> past movies you think <UNK> there might be some cool action sequences at least worth watching ' you are wrong it only gets worse as the movie progresses everyone with a few exceptions seem to kill every person that they talk to good or bad innocent or not the only good thing with the movie is that it that it has an end and that it has a rather short running time <UNK> the movie up in two words stay away
<START> i left the theater and i was only 10 years old that's how bad it sucked the plot was horrid and the acting was worse leslie <UNK> should be ashamed of himself and so should the person who made this movie i was only 10 years old when i went to see this catastrophe with a friend and even at that young innocent age i did not laugh once at the movie we me and my friend still laugh about how bad the movie was we ended up going into the <UNK> movie my parents were in bottom line this flick was bad mr <UNK> more like mr ma who this movie could have <UNK> me for life had i watched the popular cartoon on television as a child but luckily i had never seen it so i was <UNK> the agony but i will never get back those precious minutes of my life that i wasted
<START> end of days starts off pretty well arnie plays a down and out cop a very similar character to <UNK> in lethal weapon and the story looks like a kind of serial killer action thriller that will be good entertainment br br sadly it fails to deliver arnie is as good as we we have come to expect but as for gabriel <UNK> i expect him to chose his roles more carefully than this cast as the devil this is probably the weakest portrayal of the lord of darkness ever br br this movie gets a little too <UNK> for me and the end sequence aside from being very weak is visually one of the worst i've seen in recent years cgi is have been better than this since the early nineties br br quite simply not good enough 4 10 watch it if you have too but don't expect too much cause it won't deliver
<START> the toxic <UNK> part ii starts with the startling revelation that after the toxic john who was apparently fired during production replaced with ron had rid his home town <UNK> of evil it actually became a nice place to live this meant that <UNK> had no use as a superhero anymore now suffers from depression a feeling of utter <UNK> just like directors lloyd kaufman michael <UNK> should feel like after producing this <UNK> now works as a <UNK> at the centre for the <UNK> it's not long before trouble <UNK> it's ugly head though an evil chemical producing company called apocalypse inc plans to take over <UNK> for some stupid insignificant reason or other but to do so they need to get rid of <UNK> after the evil <UNK> rick collins first plan fails he <UNK> psychiatrist erika to tell him to go to japan see his father leaving his girlfriend claire <UNK> his mother jessica <UNK> his home behind <UNK> heads for tokyo japan once there <UNK> sets about finding his father a woman named <UNK> helps him in his quest meanwhile back in <UNK> apocalypse inc move in for the kill without <UNK> the citizens are <UNK> to defend themselves <UNK> eventually finds big mac whom he has been lead to believe is his father however big mac is all part of apocalypse inc plans to destroy <UNK> once for all br br produced directed by lloyd kaufman michael <UNK> this follow up to the successful the toxic <UNK> 1985 basically proves the first film was a complete <UNK> a lucky accident to combine the right blend of bad taste comedy outrageous violence so bad it's good film making the toxic <UNK> part ii is a load of crap in comparison the script by by kaufman phil gay terry with a load of <UNK> <UNK> credits does not contain one single funny moment during it's entire <UNK> uncut director's cut duration the visual gags are terrible <UNK> walking through tokyo with a wig glasses to blend in for instance or a scene where he <UNK> up a bath with a bad guy in it as he <UNK> <UNK> throws in a load of spaghetti a scene where he sticks <UNK> <UNK> up a woman's nose sticks an <UNK> in her head a <UNK> in her mouth to which a japanese radio <UNK> talks into a bit where a japanese bad guy has his nose burnt into the shape of a fish a bit where <UNK> grabs a <UNK> head uses it as a weapon or the embarrassingly bad overacting stupid idiotic facial expressions a guy who literary has a fish for a head gets turned literary into <UNK> the awful comedy music sound effects the whole film in general is a pale imitation of what made the original mildly amusing memorable the bad taste gags aren't there this time round the silly childish juvenile humour of the first is also missing it just feels like a real step back from the original lets not forget this is troma here so that is most definitely a bad thing there are a few gory fights some serious gore violence at least in the supposedly uncut <UNK> minute version i saw crushed heads with the bodies <UNK> out blood <UNK> faces intestines <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> eyes <UNK> wrapped around their throat ripped off ears severed arms a very graphic gory scene of a man being chopped to pieces unfortunately the special effects by aren't particularly convincing come mostly within the first twenty or so minutes the acting is of embarrassing proportions as i've already mentioned action wise there is an ultra cheap looking car chase at the end a few <UNK> <UNK> fights <UNK> cardboard ninja throwing stars at one point horror wise there is nothing a few gory set pieces apart comedy wise this is very unfunny in fact the toxic <UNK> part ii sucks on all levels really to top it all off it's <UNK> made as well most of the cast appear to be people <UNK> from the nearest street corner continuity is none existent cinematography is basic point shoot the special effects are anything but one or two gory scenes apart this is total crap plain simple do yourself a favour watch the original again instead
<START> this 8 minute gem is not only timeless but it is a cartoon <UNK> it is third cartoon and one of his best ones too it is a cartoon <UNK> because it was the first one with sound and my goodness even after 70 years it is ever so good and gives real additional weight to the narrative the black and white animation is excellent and the character features are convincing enough the music is wonderful i love the soundtrack it does add to the fun the cartoon has no matter how thin the story sometimes is and the cartoon is funny so many memorable moments like the <UNK> teeth being used as an <UNK> and its <UNK> as a <UNK> the characters are also engaging mickey and <UNK> two landmark disney characters are well voiced by walt disney and pete serves well as the villain of the piece all in all <UNK> willie is just a timeless gem that everybody should see at least once 10 10 <UNK> cox
<START> i completely understand why this movie was made silence of the <UNK> was an incredible film a gruesome thriller with a superb story and high jump factor br br what i don't understand is why this movie was made and why anthony hopkins agreed to <UNK> his role as <UNK> the cannibal in this terrible and <UNK> film br br there's no possible way to spoil the movie any further than going to see it could but for those of you who prefer to waste your money don't read on the film is absolutely horrible it's so bad that the transition from jodie foster to <UNK> moore becomes a non issue br br the only way to truly enjoy the film is to set your watch and leave the theatre exactly two hours into the film because up until that point it's quite an interesting thriller the between moore and hopkins is comparable to hopkins and foster and the performances by the other characters are pretty good but literally at the two hour mark the film <UNK> into nothing but a cheesy d grade horror flick it's sick and it's stupid and almost like the crew ran out of filming time and threw together an ending in one day of filming br br initial buzz over the thomas <UNK> <UNK> unsatisfying and bizarre ending led director <UNK> scott to order a re write and honestly having seen the film and read the <UNK> finale i don't know which is worse br br please don't waste your money or time on this film unless you're prepared to leave exactly at the two hour point because that's the only way you'll feel satisfied about the saga of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> continuing the mystery that made the first film and the wait for this one so great
<START> ok who ever invented this film hates humanity and wants to see them all <UNK> their throats this film was absolute and utter filth what the heck was up with the weird old <UNK> eyes seriously was she on some sort of horrible drug and then she like just thought she could control people she was running around with her freaking evil eye and it was like what do i have a <UNK> hanging out of my nose what are you staring at are you like the sea witch or something all and all though i thought the graphics were top notch old <UNK> for that alone i would give it a ten but just cover your ears when you are watching it the pure and complete evil that comes from that film will make your ears bleed and your <UNK> fall off who knows you might even get a <UNK> in your small <UNK> you better watch out fools
<START> i have always liked this film and i'm glad it's available finally on dvd so more viewers can see what i have been telling them all these years story is about a high school virgin named gary lawrence who works at a pizza place as a delivery boy and he hangs out with his friends david joe and rick steve gary notices karen diane franklin who is the new girl in school and one morning he gives her a ride and by this time he is totally in love that night at a party he <UNK> rick with karen and now he is jealous of his best friend but doesn't tell anyone of his true feelings br br spoiler alert br br rick asks gary if he can borrow his <UNK> <UNK> home but gary makes up an excuse so that rick can't get karen alone but one night rick <UNK> to gary that he nailed her at the football field and gary becomes <UNK> a few days later in the school library gary <UNK> rick and karen arguing and he asks karen what is wrong she tells him that she's pregnant and that rick has dumped her gary helps her by taking her to his <UNK> home and paying for her abortion finally gary tells karen how he really feels about her and she seems <UNK> to his feelings but later at her birthday party he walks in on karen and rick together again gary drives off without the girl this film ends with a much more realistic version of how life really is no matter how nice you are you don't necessarily get the girl br br this film was directed by <UNK> <UNK> who would go on to be a pretty competent action film director and he did two things right with this movie first he made sure that there was plenty of gratuitous nudity so that this was <UNK> to the young males that usually go to these films secondly he had the film end with young gary without karen and i think the males in the audience can relate to being screwed over no matter how hard you try and win a girls heart yes this film is silly and <UNK> but it is funny and sexy actress <UNK> <UNK> almost steals the film as the sexy <UNK> <UNK> was always a popular b level actress and you might remember her in one flew over the <UNK> nest like fast times at <UNK> high this has a very good soundtrack and the songs being played reflect what is going on in the story but at the heart of this film is two very good performances by and franklin there is nudity required by franklin but she still conveys the sorrow of a young girl who gets dumped at a crucial time she's always been a good actress and her natural charm is very evident in this film but this is still story and you can't help but feel for this guy when the film ends it's his performance that stays with you it's a solid job of acting that makes this more than just a teen sex comedy even with the silly scenarios of teens trying to have sex this film still manages to achieve what it wants underrated comedy hits the <UNK>
<START> the creative team behind <UNK> almighty really should have been able to make a better film starring one of america's favourite and <UNK> by ace <UNK> pet detective director tom <UNK> one expects a higher laugh count than the picture provides hell even steve <UNK> who wrote and directed last years atrocious <UNK> and <UNK> a writing credit here has done better work the fact of the matter is that <UNK> almighty isn't the worst picture of the summer season but it might well be the most disappointing the title and creative team behind the picture suggest this is a sequel of sorts to <UNK> bruce almighty that picture had jim carrey in the lead and whilst both steve carell and carrey are both funny guys it's the latter who's better suited to this sort of material i've heard that carrey was offered this sequel before anyone else but the actor <UNK> he saw no other places for his character to venture thus <UNK> moved over to carell who ever since an amusing bit part in the 2003 original has been <UNK> for stardom after sleeper hits the 40 year old virgin and little miss sunshine the man has become big business and so it's him rather than rubber faced jim who leads this production into theatres the story <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> steve carell having been elected as a <UNK> and thus he and his <UNK> move house and state so <UNK> can find success with his job his wife lauren graham and three kids have doubts but overall show a supportive side towards <UNK> who himself looks at the future with optimistic eyes however things start to go belly up fairly fast god morgan freeman appears to <UNK> stating a <UNK> is coming and that the politician must build an <UNK> initially ignoring the encounter <UNK> is quickly granted some <UNK> a beard that refuses to stay <UNK> and animals are beginning to appear two by two <UNK> then begins to put the boat into construction but the <UNK> aren't happy and neither is a fellow politician john goodman anyone expecting the wacky laughs of some of tom <UNK> other films will probably be left completely cold by this movie ace <UNK> liar liar and hell even bruce almighty where largely very funny pictures but all of those projects have one thing in and thats jim <UNK> presence <UNK> hasn't made a worthwhile film without carrey at the <UNK> he's worked with robin williams eddie murphy and now steve carell but still only carrey seems to <UNK> successfully with <UNK> carell after the disappointing box office and critical <UNK> won't be desperate to work with the director again and with carrey now doing more serious projects <UNK> had better find a new comic <UNK> fast carell himself is fairly dull here whoever felt that his bit part in the first movie despite being quite amusing deserved a full length feature should be taken out back and shot i expect after bruce box office draw it was universal studios themselves but you know when a quality comedian can't do anything with a character then the <UNK> persona is a dud and thats exactly the case with <UNK> almighty lauren graham isn't any great shakes as <UNK> wife nor do any of the children strike the right note freeman lets it all hang loose as god in another amusing and <UNK> performance but he appears to <UNK> to carry the piece indeed the most consistent source of laughter is <UNK> secretary <UNK> sykes and creep co worker <UNK> hill both made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project writing has been worse <UNK> but also better ace <UNK> when nature calls than his work on this production his script does have genuinely funny moments but it's also full of <UNK> family moments and the humour is never weird or indeed offensive enough the film takes tame and easy <UNK> at religion when it ought to rip the concept to <UNK> indeed the opening church sequence in the simpsons movie shakes religion harder than <UNK> whole 95 minute run with a bit more daring and heart this could have been a far better picture i don't doubt that the core family audience will be mildly entertained by this film but if they'll be satisfied is a completely different question there's a line between being watchable and being worthwhile a line that <UNK> almighty is always on the wrong side off maybe when you're feeling bored and the films on cable you can afford to watch but i can think of plenty better ways to spend my time and indeed more importantly my money than <UNK> into this mediocre comedy
<START> stupid government once again attempted to create an <UNK> and <UNK> soldier and of course the experiments went terribly wrong <UNK> us with a half man half mutant who <UNK> an awful lot and <UNK> like a little girl whenever he's upset lance <UNK> stars as the honest scientist who immediately quit the experiment upon hearing it was a military project but he returns bringing the whole family with him when he finds out his beloved guinea pig has gone on a killing spree mind <UNK> certainly is a watchable horror movie but it's very unoriginal and features pretty much every lame cliché you can think off including the estranged father rebellious teenage son sub plot yawn the characters are like wooden puppets the dumbest things are being said and done and there's a completely pointless dream sequence coming from the monster there's a handful of interesting gory scenes to enjoy and some of the isolated desert locations are effectively eerie lance <UNK> is adequate as always even though this is yet another inferior production he stars and <UNK> <UNK> surely deserved a better motion picture to make his debut in for some reason this anonymous 90's thriller is also known as the hills have eyes part 3 is it because it handles about members of the same family being <UNK> in the desert is it because wes craven was once again involved as a producer this time or maybe it's because the monster gets bald near the end like the freaky michael <UNK> in the 1977 original who knows who cares wes craven probably <UNK> this project because his son co wrote the script and it's always moving to discover that your <UNK> is equally <UNK> as you are not recommended
<START> after i couldn't ignore the hype about the show i started watching season one and it struck me as really good and i was hooked for about 5 episodes then it started to spiral <UNK> why first ethan is scripted to act as a complete idiot <UNK> that very obviously by <UNK> out semi random stuff in great expectations of it somehow becoming the next best joke br br <UNK> <UNK> got stunning looks but if she thinks <UNK> lips to explore parts of the face to which they normally never go to and making strange <UNK> to <UNK> everything she says is hilarious she's way off track maybe she thought her character would be too flat faded and she wanted to make it colorful and <UNK> but made a <UNK> of colors <UNK> of <UNK> and screams out loud for attention and it hurts my eyes ears and intellect br br i really really wanted to love this show like i said the premise is great comes from the same shelf as the fabulous destiny of <UNK> <UNK> and jason lee is doing a pretty good job here along with some of the other actors but there is no way no how i would get <UNK> and forget that this is just a show because <UNK> and surreal extreme characters abruptly wake me when they show up it's worth to note that their characters and acting would be fine if this wasn't a 70 something part series and if they didn't get that much screen time
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is the story of five <UNK> boys most being sean <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> attempt to save their school from a terrorist invasion after the american government <UNK> the <UNK> father lou jr plays the <UNK> of the school a <UNK> guy who tries to <UNK> in his students a sense of discipline br br <UNK> <UNK> is a funny and pretty cool action and certainly the better of hostage crisis at school movies i think most of the appeal comes from the teen cast but also the terrorists don't come off as completely useless whereas in some movies they never seem to be quite the <UNK> group that they should trapped inside the <UNK> school and threatened to be killed if the military or police <UNK> this is a very <UNK> challenge for these group of guys who plan to save the school they're actually pretty clever about it too br br i was surprised that it was a pretty good movie it keeps a steady pace and doesn't get ridiculously sentimental or anything like that <UNK> and jr give good performances br br i too agree that this is an underrated action movie
<START> now let me see if i have this correct a lunatic serial killer is going around murdering estate agents okay what's wrong with that scenario i can live with that br br what next a slasher with tax <UNK> butchered traffic <UNK> <UNK> to death are we supposed to feel any sympathy for empty headed and shallow money obsessed property people er no br br sadly joking aside it's just not a very well made film with poor acting and crude effects the climatic scene is particularly silly you can almost see the director shouting <UNK> to the <UNK> as he falls through the glass of the window br br as another reviewer quite rightly said after starring in 'the fog ' this was the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> career therefore i was happy to see that she had it by becoming the voice of <UNK> in the batman animated series while watching the extras on the live action <UNK> film <UNK> not quite the awful film it's made out to be by the way br br this however is a bad film think a poor episode of <UNK> or <UNK> of san francisco ' and you will get an idea of what is on offer here
<START> this review contains a spoiler br br the movie is an american ninja mysteriously trained in the martial arts he falls for the <UNK> daughter and turns from the most hated <UNK> on the post to the people's hero at the end of the film this film is extremely cheesy and very poorly <UNK> it is good for folks who do not care about plot development or reality good for kids under 14 the military errors in this film is comical i remember during my three years in the military us <UNK> were not required to <UNK> or call <UNK> sir the film does this in various spots the <UNK> hair is way too long on the ears the master <UNK> was against military <UNK> in length on the post the colonel was the only officer around not one other officer was shown walking around the post you had idiot ninjas swords against troops with m rather poorly made br br folks this filmed <UNK> michael <UNK> is not really that bad of an actor he just has lousy scripts the ninjas were more hilarious than dangerous avoid this film
<START> i have to give this movie a 4 because of a couple of things br br 1 what i'll call the stupid victim syndrome if you have the killer on the floor and you have his gun shoot him please if you are a cop and you have your shotgun pointed at the killer's back shoot him please br br 2 when you are in a high stress situation and you have your finger on the trigger of a gun your first instinct is to squeeze this is one of the first things they teach you in <UNK> training and the reason that you don't put your finger on the trigger until you are ready to fire ask any hunter or <UNK> if you are <UNK> your <UNK> should also contract making you squeeze your finger br br 3 it's really hard to lay on the floor completely still for 8 hours without 2 other people one of them a doctor not <UNK> that you aren't dead even more so if you are supposedly dying of a brain <UNK> and were in the hospital just a few months earlier br br 4 technically the killer did kill one of his victims the guy he <UNK> with poison that had to get the <UNK> if you poison someone that is murder br br 5 what was <UNK> lesson that he was supposed to learn yes the doctor needed to be there but what was <UNK> crime maybe i just missed something br br other than those things i would have given this movie a higher grade the plot was pretty good and the ways the killer chose to kill his victims were very inventive i can even forgive the terrible acting on the doctor's part the scenes with his family were enough to make me sick the cinematography and soundtrack were very good but the ending seemed contrived and just didn't work for me thank goodness i didn't have to pay to see this or i would have <UNK> a <UNK>
<START> a bit too much <UNK> for me the cast was beautiful lovely to watch in all of the romantic scenes the locale was beautiful with <UNK> and water it just was not convincing to me that such an <UNK> <UNK> bent on nothing but his building could attract so many beautiful vulnerable women only in the <UNK> i guess certainly in no world i am familiar with the macho men were really obnoxious and i found it difficult to believe that the female characters could have anything to to with them for so long the screenplay cinematography directing etc was set up to deliver a class b film the central effort being on showing scenes of beautiful exposed female breasts it was <UNK> nice for a while but it could not sustain a very mediocre film
<START> i saw this movie on video with a couple of friends as part of a teen comedy triple <UNK> alongside <UNK> <UNK> and going greek obviously we weren't going for quality but for air headed entertainment and gross out gags generally we got what we came for but wild <UNK> really stood out for being awful br br first impression first the cover the norwegian release cover showed breasts covered up and a bunch of seemingly crazy <UNK> in the background brings up pictures of drunken semi naked teenagers doing <UNK> of funny stuff stuff doesn't it the crazy <UNK> on the cover were not even featured in the picture and the funny stuff you assume they'll be doing absent as well br br this movie was labeled comedy which is a bit strange since it not even remotely funny relationship drama would be more accurate br br put shortly the movie is about a young couple <UNK> a <UNK> house in la and are forced to get some <UNK> to make ends meet these roommates eventually put both the young <UNK> patience and relationship to the test because they're so wild problem is they're not and here lies the problem of this movie the protagonist couple are so <UNK> <UNK> and neurotic that they manage to generate zero sympathy you'll find yourself rooting for the antagonist <UNK> halfway through the movie add mediocre acting lame dialogue and boring direction and you got yourself a movie that is best left unseen br br see something else
<START> as usual leader leo <UNK> as slip <UNK> and the <UNK> boys are hard pressed for cash after <UNK> trying to sell their old <UNK> the <UNK> look for help at the local bank there hapless <UNK> hall as has his picture taken by pretty photographer <UNK> as cathy smith but since the shot was <UNK> during a robbery it makes mr hall look like the prime suspect with pals bobby jordan as bobby william billy <UNK> as <UNK> and david <UNK> as chuck mr <UNK> wants to clear hall and collect the 1 000 reward money <UNK> <UNK> goes through the motions with ms <UNK> a main strength br br <UNK> <UNK> 7 20 <UNK> phil leo <UNK> <UNK> hall <UNK> bobby jordan
<START> this without any doubt is the greatest spin off to jackass ever made hell it even blows jackass out of the water br br picture this you have a group of guys who just didn't want to grow up throw in a ton of money and some seriously cool stunts and you have <UNK> la <UNK> br br this show it's such a family based one and it's not just the gang running around being complete <UNK> like in jackass for example parents april and phil are in every episode with appearances of <UNK> uncle don <UNK> to boot the reason why the family makes us laugh is simple somebody in our family can relate april the woman who wants to live life by the book and follow tradition phil the guy who tries to be a good father and finally <UNK> that son that never grew out of high school br br the pranks and jokes in every episode will give you a guaranteed laugh and buying the dvds is definitely recommended another thing which is surprising to see is how casual is over the whole thing he's said in interviews that for the majority of episodes he isn't acting and is just acting off instinct br br what i liked the most about the whole thing however is the amount of influence has over mtv he wanted <UNK> to play in his backyard mtv did it he wanted to hang with dani filth for a day and have a cradle of filth concert in his backyard it happened br br add to this his passion for the love metal and <UNK> as <UNK> band h i m and his brother's garage band and there's a whole lot of head <UNK> going on br br if you liked jackass you'll fall in love with this i borrowed season 1 from a friend last year and i would give up my legs to meet the <UNK> la <UNK> crew you will not be disappointed and i can promise you'll be in <UNK> by the end of it all
<START> it is always great to see a movie that teaches us about history in africa as they are definitely too few however the movie depicts as a political leader who wanted the new independent country to be the same as the old <UNK> one i felt it hard to <UNK> with this kind of <UNK> yet the movie is somewhat like a homage to the man there was too little content explaining how the man got to rise in the first place and the whole context of <UNK> letting them go so it is certainly worth going to see as the acting and photography are excellent especially himself i would just have liked a better political analysis
<START> first off i am a huge fan of <UNK> and as one i will base most of my critic on his books br br the movie is a standard adventure movie well made with nifty special effects nice sound track and fine acting now if this movie was called something else than lord of the rings the reviews wouldn't be half this good as they are here br br the problem of the movie is that it takes the basic story line from <UNK> books but then it goes and <UNK> everything it can numerous scenes from the book are missing or changed quite a lot the characters are changed from the book also a thing that i think should be <UNK> what the movie lacks is deep insight of the characters in it i know that it is almost impossible to make a good film out of a good book and it didn't work here mostly the motivation of the characters is left <UNK> at best br br as a adventure movie it would rate 7 10 as a adaptation of <UNK> it rates 2 10 br br i mean honestly what on earth was <UNK> doing at <UNK> ford and as for the comments that this movie is the best ever i can only say that you are very young or you <UNK> seen good movies br br peter jackson should have called this movie an adventure movie based on the lord of the rings
<START> this movie is brilliant br br i don't remember this movie even being in theaters so thinking it was a straight to dvd i have fairly low expectations even though i am a big fan of mike judge it has some of the same kind of comic future satire as brazil and <UNK> man but taken to the next level br br then i saw the cast luke wilson <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> shepard who were all brilliant in their roles br br needless to say this movie won me over in the first 5 minutes where it shows above average people having fewer children and the <UNK> stupidest <UNK> people having lots of ignorant children and how this is leading to a kind of reverse evolution it takes that concept and then shows where we are headed with this <UNK> of the gene pool br br sadly i don't think it will take the 500 years as depicted but probably only about 50 i already see the shocking rise of mild <UNK> in the general <UNK> media and culture people who like classical music and art are <UNK> instead of respected the lowest common <UNK> seems to rule especially in hollywood and on tv <UNK> jackass the movie and any reality show where they make you eat something disgusting or <UNK> yourself for money br br all of the political social satire aside this movie is also just laugh out loud funny and i don't say that lightly few movies make me actually lol but this one did br br a lot of the best jokes are word sight gags in the background so you really have to pay attention to get some of them i even had to pause and zoom in for a few of them like when joe got his government id and for hair it said yes and for eyes it also said yes also the prison has <UNK> on the front house for particular individuals since the cops in the movie much like real life cops call everyone individuals instead of people etc again this was on the screen for just a moment this is one of those movies you can watch again and again and <UNK> it to get through the layers of funny br br also i normally watch movies with the subtitles on and that <UNK> me in to some jokes that might pass by your ears in the dialog mix for instance the police constantly talk about people instead of escaping and there are many other <UNK> <UNK> that just <UNK> me up but again i might not have picked up on them just by the dialog mixed with music sound effects it is very subtle but still hilarious br br additionally the special effects were really good for a sci fi social satire br br i could go on and on but overall i think this is one of those movies that if you don't think it's funny it's probably making fun of you i plan on <UNK> this to many many people
<START> watch this movie just to see <UNK> khan say i love you k k <UNK> it's both heartbreaking and frightening at the same time when he says this from the beginning to the end this movie made him famous and i totally recommend it d it's highly entertaining the <UNK> wicked and you will laugh right along with <UNK> here you'll genuinely feel scared for the hero and heroine and oddly enough you will identify with at least one of the characters you will feel sad and happy and <UNK> and afraid at the same time go see this classic bollywood movie with your good buddies and some lovely food and have a day in and after you see the movie have the songs and scenery playing in your mind forever
<START> i just saw the big trail in <UNK> <UNK> for the first time immediately i was <UNK> by both the pictures <UNK> high quality and unusual format and by its beautifully detailed story who has ever seen such a documentary style western with john wayne and there is so much time you can actually look around on the screen there is so much to see one is ever grateful that the scenes are often static because every single shot is so well composed and you want to take it it even the acting is good and fits in well the long running time of the picture is wonderful you don't want to miss a minute of it
<START> this movie is way too long i lost interest about one hour into the story <UNK> <UNK> tells the story of ingrid bergman who is an the child of a prominent new orleans man and his mistress after her mother dies in paris bergman comes back to new orleans to her father's legitimate family and to blackmail them she meets gary cooper who is likewise seeking revenge against the <UNK> <UNK> who cheated his father out of his land in texas she draws him into her schemes and the movie <UNK> at a <UNK> resort long and boring but worth watching if you are a bergman or cooper fan the midget provides the only bright spot in this meandering story
<START> this movie is a absolute masterpiece and <UNK> has all the kinky sex car crashes <UNK> and a penis monster that shakespeare always wanted but never got this is <UNK> classic <UNK> troma style <UNK> and juliet is about two rival <UNK> named the and the non of the <UNK> ever got along ever since <UNK> <UNK> father screwed monty <UNK> father in the filmmaking business two rival <UNK> grow apart until <UNK> and juliet find true love together and when each side hear of this blood shed is the least that happens yes <UNK> and juliet is the troma classic <UNK> by fans world wide witness harry balls the penis monster first feature film and also has first troma appearance what are you waiting for now go out and rent the movie br br 10 10 br br
<START> i too was fortunate enough to see checking out with peter falk at the phoenix film festival this is an extremely sweet character driven film that leaves the audience enthralled in the plight in life more than funny each character in the family contributes priceless comic relief that not only <UNK> laughter but <UNK> a few <UNK> tears as well peter falk was born to play this role he plays a <UNK> young father of three who brings his adult children together in what could possibly be one of the most important times in his and their lives the 2 day journey that the family takes though the delightful backdrop of new york with carefully selected characters not only leaves the audience wanting more but <UNK> ones own sense of family checking out is a must see film not only for all those who <UNK> family but also all those who don't my thanks to the director who took the chance to bring this gift to its audience robin sly <UNK> arizona
<START> at what point does a film become so bad it's good compelling in it's awfulness <UNK> stands out as a shining example of c p cinematography and for that alone probably deserves some kind of award br br the plot revolves around the age old battle of heaven and hell for the <UNK> souls of the recently dead in the case of <UNK> the <UNK> of good and evil <UNK> themselves <UNK> as a herd of cats a <UNK> grim <UNK> figure with a face of <UNK> flames similar to a coal effect electric fire a philip <UNK> a like with a seriously bad <UNK> and a female psychologist who appears to be on day release from <UNK> save br br the protagonists are competing for the soul of a newly dead teacher who spends most of the film running around a <UNK> field and <UNK> a <UNK> in an attempt to <UNK> his <UNK> br br the plot is spread thinner than a <UNK> with no character development or attempt to build suspense the acting is laughable comparable to a school play although that would be an insult to many educational <UNK> and the dialogue oh how my sides <UNK> with the <UNK> souls of the dead being described as life's <UNK> by the flame glow demon you wonder whether hell really is a <UNK> br br but is is <UNK> compelling you find yourself watching just to see how bad it can get at just over 80 minutes it's worth the time spent for the unintentional <UNK>
<START> the thing which makes fire even more appealing to watch apart from its magical artistry is its touch of and rebellion to my mind the very character played by <UNK> <UNK> is a symbol of the indian feminine protest against the indian society the name of the movie and the scene when <UNK> walks through flames in her kitchen are of <UNK> lord wife walking through fire for the proof of her as per the same narrative which appears in the film too the film could be a great inspiration for women particularly those in the to search for their liberties and to <UNK> control of their lives
<START> i am a music lover and was excited to see this movie unfortunately i was disappointed i was ready to walk out half way through the movie i didn't identify with any of the characters which meant that i didn't care what happened to them and lost interest in the story completely on the good side ed harris looked exactly like <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> is always a pleasure to hear so that made part of the film bearable also the parts where they talk about the bridge almost redeemed the entire movie but it couldn't sustain me through to the end the actors did what they could with what they had to work with but the screenplay just wasn't adequate to make it even remotely interesting the bit about wash me was utter rubbish i wonder how many takes the actors had to do on that one i wouldn't be able to say those lines without <UNK> into laughter anyway such a shame it could have been so much better
<START> jaded takes on the complex question of abuse the <UNK> and the victims in lesser hands it would have <UNK> into an erotic thriller made for direct to video this director however has managed to pull off a <UNK> multi layered study with a decidedly different point of view br br given the fact that the director writer is a woman and the main detective and d a are also women this could have turned into a very anti male film it is not to be a sexual predator is gender neutral the nudity of this film is not erotic the rape is brutal not sexual we are looking at victims and not <UNK> br br the gifted cast rings true for a film that is so little known i was surprised at the quality of the performances they are good carla and are incredible br br somehow this film got lost perhaps it is too smart for its own good it is a should see highly recommend a thinking person's sexual thriller
<START> adam <UNK> movies are my favorite comedies the silence of the <UNK> is my favorite horror movie the matrix is my favorite sci fi movie anywhere but here is my favorite drama br br perhaps the single most valuable asset that this movie has is it's acting br br susan sarandon is absolutely amazing by the end of this movie i felt as if i knew her character better than i knew myself she did a simply amazing job br br natalie portman also did a great job i recently rented her first movie leon 1994 in which she played a 12 year old girl i believe that she is a <UNK> in terms she was a good kid actress well 5 years later she is still just as good an actress in fact she's much better br br not only did sarandon and portman portray their characters well but they also worked perfectly together i mean even now i can hardly believe that they are not actually mother and daughter in real life as well as in this movie br br this movie is about a 14 year old girl portman and her restless mother sarandon that leave their home town in <UNK> for beverly hills br br at first portman hates her mother for taking her away from her cousin and friends and the two begin a very <UNK> relationship that goes up and down over the course of a couple years usually down might i add br br although this explanation is a little vague the plot can only be <UNK> vaguely but when you see this movie you will see that the plot really is not so vague or weak for it is actually very deep what i am saying is that the plot is <UNK> <UNK> but then they focus in on it to make it strong br br and it is very strong but also the plot <UNK> is great and there are a few brilliant scenes that i hope will someday be seen as classic br br i loved this movie i laughed i cried and although admittedly there are a few <UNK> it's still a stellar movie and it really comes together in the end
<START> the film begins with a little girl rita seeing her father killed he apparently was a criminal who on his fellow crooks later and this part makes little sense the girl has grown to <UNK> and still her father's past <UNK> her a bit later rita meets a good for nothing and dates him during one of their dates he's a bit <UNK> and driving like a total fool the cops give chase and he <UNK> away killing a pedestrian in the meantime here comes the really stupid part he convinces her to confess to the crime as he <UNK> her his lawyers can get her off <UNK> free why oh why would she agree to this yet she does and spends the next couple years in prison and soon after her conviction this boyfriend disappears showing that he's a total <UNK> what a <UNK> later after her release her friend jack la <UNK> informs her about the truth about the boyfriend then he explains the <UNK> family is loaded and she should shake them down for lots of cash for all the trouble he put her to by taking the rap frankly this does make sense as they certainly owe it to her especially since they knew she'd go to prison and had every intention of using her and then casting her aside br br now the idea of bleeding money from the rich <UNK> is a good plot idea however there is no way this would have occurred in the first place because it's hard to believe anyone could be so stupid as to take the rap for a hit and run in an interesting twist the dumb lady decides on a life of crime <UNK> a wig and picking up a rich guy taking him into the desert and robbing him at <UNK> wow how she's changed apparently she loves the idea of stealing from <UNK> i e rich <UNK> however and this made no sense she soon stopped doing this and began shaking down the father of the old boyfriend why she bothered to do some petty <UNK> in the meantime made little sense and what also was a bit hard to believe was that instead of wanting money from the old jerk she was interested in getting him to put his influence behind a mob controlled man for mayor odd very very odd br br in the meantime another plot develops involving a young alan <UNK> he's an undercover agent who has <UNK> the mob he was chosen because he just happens to be a dead <UNK> for a real crook what a cliché but what makes no sense is that this real crook isn't in jail and is out committing crimes while the fake one is <UNK> the mob in another town br br eventually evidence that <UNK> is able to <UNK> is enough to issue <UNK> to the mob <UNK> including rita this is a case of very bad timing as in the <UNK> she's made a decision to become a decent and legitimate woman as she's met a really nice guy who she wants to marry wow what are the odds overall this is a goofy and rather dumb movie that suffers from kitchen sink syndrome in other words there is way too many plot elements and weird twists to make the movie the least bit believable plus since the movie is only a little over an hour long it all seems very forced and contrived it's a relatively bad b movie from crap studio <UNK> of note only for the performance of alan <UNK> just before he gained great fame the following year at paramount br br by the way this dvd was released by <UNK> video a company which sometimes releases some wonderfully obscure titles mostly public <UNK> but which never <UNK> up the <UNK> or adds closed <UNK> in other words the dvd production values are strictly 3rd rate at best
<START> a <UNK> soldier kills a man for being jewish and tries to pin it on a fellow soldier not as good as the novel it was based on the brick <UNK> in which it was a gay man who was killed but hollywood wouldn't touch that in <UNK> that said it's still a very good film the anti <UNK> is handled very well but it's <UNK> into the audience that <UNK> is bad well duh but this was <UNK> the picture is well acted by the entire cast especially robert young and robert ryan and the tone is very dark as it should be very atmospheric too a deserved big hit in its day well worth seeing
<START> i have been looking for this mini series for a very long time i saw this movie when i was living in back in russia many years ago i'm curious if somebody who has the recorded copy of this movie can send me the copy i'm willing to cover all the <UNK> and pay for the extra tapes or dvds this is one of the best tv series that i have ever watched i would recommend it to anybody who is somewhat interested in israel history and world history after wwii i'm also trying to find a book i have heard that its even better than the movie however the new one costs around 50 on amazon and i have never purchased a used copy my e mail address is <UNK> com thank you very much for you help
<START> so many fans so little to show for it i know i know these words are gonna find me in a great minority a lot of people really liked good will hunting but seriously please great film making not even close and let's put the blame where it belongs in the writing br br now i know they won an oscar for it and boy did they look good <UNK> on the screen but good will hunting is an abc after school special with lots of <UNK> in it and a slightly bigger budget br br what this movie does show is the brilliance of harvey <UNK> and <UNK> pictures mr <UNK> could take <UNK> feed it to you and make you believe your eating bon and that's exactly what the studio did with the film they created such high buzz around it that people believed and wanted to believe it so much that they saw brilliance where there was none br br now i know some people think it's a great movie i don't think it's a horribly bad movie i like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies and also to some great made for tv movies although not hbo films hbo films are unusually better than good will hunting would ever be it's just a nice little film with some good performances robin williams was not good in it they just gave him the oscar cause been <UNK> to do it for a while and of course the <UNK> public relations machine <UNK> ben and matt their <UNK> oscar but come one people there's better movies out there
<START> <UNK> is clearly derivative of the <UNK> <UNK> of crime films released since quentin tarantino took the genre by storm with <UNK> dogs and pulp fiction in the early nineties but it has enough ideas of it's own to ensure that it remains an interesting little film <UNK> <UNK> a few characters mostly within a single location it works because each character is quirky enough in their own right to be memorable and when put together what you've got is a very amusing little thriller there is little substance to be found within the plot but it doesn't matter because nobody goes into this sort of film expecting a life <UNK> experience the plot follows <UNK> a former drug dealer who has gone straight and is now living as a successful architect in <UNK> with his wife the pair wants to adopt a child but things turn awry when <UNK> receives a visit from his old partner in crime nick who brought with him a case of heroine and a load of money stolen from the cops <UNK> is going to turn out to be a very interesting day for our former criminal br br the first scene sets the film up rather nicely and <UNK> that we know what to expect we see a coffee order go wrong which turns into a murder scene that the <UNK> promptly cover up when a cop comes in for <UNK> the scene is <UNK> with dark humour and witty dialogues and that is carried on throughout the rest of the movie <UNK> is a very funny film and scenes such as the ones that see the <UNK> visitor turn up at an awkward time ensure that the film is difficult to dislike it's true that the film doesn't bring anything new to the table <UNK> or plot wise but the fact that it's happy to <UNK> in its <UNK> <UNK> that there's more time for the absurd situation to build around the central characters the acting is decent enough with the entire cast clearly having fun with this plot thomas jane holds the film together well in the lead role while amusing portrayals from james <UNK> michael <UNK> glenn plummer and mickey rourke back him up nicely this film is unlikely to impress the seasoned film fan but if you just want an amusing little movie with a few enjoyable twists and performances <UNK> is likely to suffice
<START> another asian horror movie packed with intense and creepy moments another asian horror trademark is the complexity of the plot which is here as well major spoiler warning br br the movie starts pretty simple two sisters go to live with their dad and stepmother after being put in a mental institution after their mother <UNK> herself the sisters seem very hostile towards their mother especially the elder one and they seem to ignore their father all goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the elder sister tells her father then it hits you your sister has been dead for years now it turns out the older sister is still not <UNK> from the death of her mother and what we didn't know is that the wardrobe the mother was <UNK> in fell on the younger sister and killed her as well as for the stepmother she is the alter ego of the older sister revealed when the stepmother actually the sister's alter ego is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother walks in i hope it has been made <UNK> for confused asian horror fans out there br br finally my favourite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke which <UNK> into a panic attack very creepy 7 out of 10
<START> may be spoilers so do not read if you do not want to just like watching the tv news everything is already happened a great <UNK> <UNK> over a city bay and cut no more to see suffers a large <UNK> did anyone see more than the 5 seconds i saw if you want to make a love story make a love story but if you want to use a disaster movie title do please be kind enough to show me the disaster <UNK> after watching this movie watch or any godzilla film to satisfy the part that was willing to see people screaming and buildings <UNK> that did not get a chance to do in this movie don t take me wrong i love disaster movies and i love the original and i even like the latest <UNK> not to much of a story there but a very good and graphic disaster sequence new <UNK> the point as many times as pearl <UNK> or the day after tomorrow but at least this two movies do show good disaster sequences and also enough with the expensive fx that did not show anything give me fake buildings if you like as long as you do destroy them properly i know i must sound like a sadistic freak however i did go to see love actually when i felt like going to see a romantic film even <UNK> makes me cry and this movie <UNK> t there is also a tv series called <UNK> made in 1975 i have on dvd and it is much better
<START> sadly this movie did have potential with such a willing cast but everything was so poorly thought out and poorly executed i don't think i've ever seen any film where every scene just falls flat with a loud <UNK> as it did here also i don't think i've ever seen a <UNK> sex comedy that didn't provide at least one laugh but this <UNK> of pain provided nothing but <UNK> and misery the last time i was this stunned at how un funny a comedy can be was with the awful big <UNK> house scene after scene these movies will turn your brain into <UNK> silly and stupid can sometimes be funny but here silly and stupid are used as a torture device against the viewer an absolute rock bottom dud
<START> let me begin by saying that i adore the book and loved the a e miniseries i was hoping to love this film and i was absolutely willing to allow it a <UNK> degree of artistic license in <UNK> and the actual story however this film <UNK> resembles the original book if only the names had been changed to protect the innocent i would have possibly enjoyed the movie as simply an entertaining if inaccurate period piece br br unfortunately putting the name mr <UNK> on a character who is emotional and weak giving the name elizabeth bennett to a reckless <UNK> often <UNK> eyed <UNK> who cares nothing for the rules of society and making mr a wide eyed <UNK> absolutely destroyed the idea that the director had ever read jane <UNK> original story br br there are some really stellar moments in this movie perhaps a total of 10 minutes are truly excellent <UNK> explanation of why she accepted mr <UNK> <UNK> begins beautifully she is 27 years old quite near the hopeless <UNK> age in those times she is becoming a burden on her family and she is not romantic she only wants a comfortable home however the beautiful dialogue is ruined when she <UNK> don't you judge me elizabeth don't you dare judge me and runs off in tears later you see charlotte to lady catherine de which was not at all in her character as described in the book br br another good moment is when <UNK> catches elizabeth in his home while she is <UNK> the area with her aunt and uncle it was well done in the a e series but the film version with <UNK> knightley made the audience feel <UNK> how very <UNK> that moment must have been for elizabeth very nice br br the ending also illustrated a level of affection between elizabeth and <UNK> that was not shown as obviously in the miniseries i actually appreciated that scene simply because i like to see a happy ending rather than just know that it took place br br altogether though this movie eliminated the subtlety that was such an integral part of <UNK> pride and prejudice the characters speak in a jarring combination of <UNK> dialogue <UNK> and modern phrases and <UNK> information that was only <UNK> to or suggested in the original work is blatantly stated in this version yes time was a concern it's only a short movie <UNK> <UNK> but turning a complex beautiful book into a superficial love story is ridiculous br br some have commented that they loved the moment when <UNK> first sees elizabeth because it is so obviously a case of love at first sight love at first sight huh one of the best aspects of the book is that elizabeth is not supposed to be a traditional beauty and <UNK> comes to love her for her wit and <UNK> he literally loves her for her mind br br this version also had a moment during first <UNK> when the two are yelling <UNK> at each other while <UNK> closer and closer and almost kissing but they suddenly step apart ugh what a sad cliché they're angry and disgusted with each other but so attracted that it doesn't matter that at the time they don't even like each other ridiculous br br the characterizations were all so far removed from those described in the book that it really was like a different story mr <UNK> was <UNK> elizabeth usually acted just as silly as her younger sisters charlotte was emotional somewhat <UNK> and desperate for a home of her own unlike the intelligent slightly scheming woman with an abundance of common sense who is portrayed in the novel jane and <UNK> relationship is merely <UNK> instead of the deep <UNK> love and admiration they are supposed to have for each other br br all this i could have accepted as merely poor interpretations of the novel but i refused to accept all that in addition to the many many historical inaccuracies miss walked around <UNK> <UNK> her dress looked like what the others would wear as tight <UNK> elizabeth walked to with her hair down and allowed to fly all over the family <UNK> about one morning though <UNK> were supposed to be reserved for calling on <UNK> or being called on at your own home elizabeth walked outside <UNK> in her <UNK> and in a really appalling scene walked into jane's bedroom and <UNK> with her and sounded like an idiot when she was ill br br most people would feel these are minor points but i simply wanted either a an historically accurate film or b an accurate representation of the characters in the novel br br the director writer whoever sacrificed accuracy subtlety and a good story for a trite tale of love at first sight i can <UNK> that those who have not read the book or who are not familiar with the social conventions of the time could very easily like this movie and there is nothing wrong with that i simply couldn't overcome my desire to see a film that involved more than just two pretty faces
<START> <UNK> the man who knew too much is exceptional entertainment to those who prefer the 1934 original i will say that that one is faster paced and <UNK> however even though the american version was heaven <UNK> a big budget blockbuster i believe it blows the british version out of the water i think this is one of hitchcock's 10 best no small feat considering he made over 50 films and many of them were among the greatest of all time i find so many things to love br br 1 james stewart america's favorite <UNK> for so many years does an excellent job playing the <UNK> father here he can make any film enjoyable and working with such a likeable character in such a gripping story he had me rooting for him very intensely leslie banks in the original is nothing in comparison br br 2 doris day yes doris day despite all the criticisms directed toward her i think she makes the loving wife mother an extremely sympathetic person i disagree with the negative remarks towards her character just because she is soft spoken and gentle it doesn't mean she is <UNK> and helpless i don't want to spoil anything but she does make a crucial discovery by herself after her husband has failed she gives the story a level of warmth that just wasn't there in the first one and for those who care about that this version is the way to go and i loved <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i think it is one of the most beautiful songs i've ever heard and deservedly won its oscar it <UNK> the film to another level br br 3 the albert hall sequence i don't think it was too long at all i think the suspense built the whole time to that terrific <UNK> and hitchcock's direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant and the assassin was truly frightening br br 4 the ending really put a smile on my face even after the aforementioned scene was over i found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was great to see the charming family together again the last line in the film is highly amusing i don't think the film started out slowly was trying to get us to know and like the and he did a great job i wasn't a huge fan of the kid playing hank but i didn't have a problem with him since hank was ben and <UNK> kid i cared about him too it's not like he was a brat or anything br br i found no major flaws in this movie and so many major and minor virtues way to go <UNK>
<START> i guess my husband and i are a little slow we don't usually warm up to a series until they are almost at the end of their production life in this case we didn't start watching until almost the <UNK> season i'm not sure how it escaped our radar for so long other than the fact that we are not big fans of <UNK> tv viewing our <UNK> our such that we don't like to commit to watching series every time they come on and we didn't have a <UNK> yet so i guess it wasn't until <UNK> starting running reruns on their daily <UNK> in the <UNK> that we started watching consistently br br by the time we got hooked there were only a couple more <UNK> left before the series was canceled but we still watch it almost daily on <UNK> i almost prefer to see series this way because you can watch multiple episodes day after day and it helps to build continuity and what's going on with the characters without having to wait a whole week br br but the episodes stand alone in the since that the stories don't carry over from week to week but that is fine with me because you can watch an episode then miss weeks and still pick back up br br my only criticism is the writing wasn't always consistent some episodes would be outrageously hilarious and then some would only be mildly funny so i'm not sure it had the quality of writers that seinfeld or raymond had but i loved the casting and the characters are all quite believable and realistic kevin james is just plain funny to look at so even if the plot isn't that great james body language and expressions make the show worth watching <UNK> is great as the play it straight wife i think its harder to play the straight character for laughs than the comedic character and she does a great job she has a knack at sarcasm and insults like no one else she is one tough cookie and who can forget arthur as <UNK> dad who lives with them in their basement br br this a great series and i was sorry when it cancelled but a big thanks to <UNK> for keeping the king alive in reruns
<START> critics and audiences both pretty much <UNK> this movie but i actually didn't think it was too bad even the critics i normally agree with thought it was crap and i normally despise pg 13 horror films so this means one of two things either 1 i'm too easily pleased and my taste in movies has <UNK> over the years or 2 <UNK> a stranger <UNK> isn't nearly as horrible as it's made out to be now to be fair some of the criticisms of the movie are true there's not much character development and not much happens in the story but man alive folks how much were you expecting from a movie about a babysitter being stalked cut them some slack as a former babysitter who was watching this flick late at night with the lights out i can safely say the stalker dude was one creepy <UNK> who knows i guess stuff like this just gives me the <UNK> br br yes i admit i had fun watching this and i don't care how big of a minority that puts me in
<START> if one wants to have a character in a movie have a disturbing sexual encounter that would shame that character in later life the only thing left that an audience would see as shameful was <UNK> and now it has been done judging by some of the other comments even that did not succeed that well i cannot remember one funny scene though i have to admit i had to turn it off before it was finished i did watch a part of the director's commentary and it appears he was as surprised as anyone that the movie was doing well if you want to get the same feeling you get from this movie but only cheaper stick your head in a pile of <UNK> and breath deeply
<START> i wasn't surprised to read a comment by the director to the effect that she made this film as an <UNK> to all those making of dvd <UNK> as that certainly struck me i do confess that i have a <UNK> for <UNK> but i found this film to be very accessible and entertaining and not even in a <UNK> self <UNK> clever way which is certainly a bit of what you expect in a film about film making it is very french in that there are a great deal of outlandish yet occasionally compelling theories about how film making and even sexuality works but since the director doesn't quite play herself using an <UNK> instead we're left with a lot of choices since i'm pretty sure she's constantly <UNK> herself apparently catherine <UNK> in hard to watch films but i'd definitely say this one doesn't qualify i really enjoyed the dialog the balance between the cinematic and the natural the relationships between the director character and her assistant and actor and so on highly recommended
<START> nothing but the void a pleasant one for those who have known the eighties but well quite boring for those who are not interested in it no screenplay in this film but a hero wandering in an underground new york full of and night <UNK> it is <UNK> pointless and naive but not entirely unpleasant
<START> running out of time is probably as close to a perfect film as you're ever likely to see out of hong kong all the elements click a terrific script by french writers <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> that even manages to <UNK> the odd cliché <UNK> imaginative direction by <UNK> to and excellent central performances by andy <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> wan the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody especially in his <UNK> reactions to his <UNK> abysmal <UNK> skills the supporting cast is fine too with <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> making a strong impression in a tiny role and even the often <UNK> lee looking remarkably and very <UNK> like a bald andy <UNK> it in to good effect it's best not to know too much about the plot going in beyond the basic set up  with only a few weeks to live <UNK> <UNK> in a criminal game with <UNK> cop with no easily apparent motive  and just sit back and enjoy the ride it's certainly worth the fare it also has one of the most perfect love stories in recent movies and played in a mere three scenes the second bus ride is one of the most magical moments of film making i've seen in ages there's also a fine score by raymond wong as well the most fun playing cat and mouse at the movies in years
<START> in the twilight years of his career charles bronson <UNK> long running with several directors most notably j lee thompson and michael winner he did two films for one time bond director peter hunt too the first being the decent 1981 <UNK> death hunt the second being this indifferent political chase thriller assassination is pretty dull if truth be known and come the end you'll find yourself longing for something with a bit more passion and pace like the conspiracy for instance which <UNK> this film resembles br br bronson <UNK> through his role as bodyguard jay <UNK> whose assignment is to protect the american <UNK> wife lara <UNK> craig jill ireland real life wife of bronson <UNK> believes that mrs craig has been <UNK> by <UNK> she thinks he's an over protective paranoid <UNK> turns out surprise surprise that <UNK> was right all along and someone is indeed out to <UNK> her the pair of them go on the run pursued by the <UNK> br br everyone knows that the wife of an american president is known as the first lady for some reason in this film they have <UNK> her one mama quite what the point of this is is <UNK> guess but it's <UNK> of the film's <UNK> as a whole most of the film's performances are lazy and the script takes a heck of a long time to get to where it's going if i had to label assassination within a specific genre i'd say it is supposed to be a thriller i'd say that with some <UNK> however as to say that it's a thriller it has precious few thrills
<START> after sitting through the <UNK> that was the first dark <UNK> movie i couldn't leave bad enough alone upon seeing that there was a sequel or rather what i believed to be a sequel i had to increase my pain level seeing that this had nothing to do with dark <UNK> that should have been a good thing we didn't get any killer scarecrows in this one instead we got a jackass walking around a <UNK> screaming out little things like girls and can you hear me every so often plus we got two four if you include the two girls that the director wanted the same effect as the twins in the shining obnoxious little girls who couldn't act and the <UNK> on top of this mess would have to be the corn cop i should have known this movie was going to be terrible when the dog got an opening credit how i managed to stay awake through this movie i'll never know
<START> a friend of mine once rented this thinking since peter fonda starred in it it couldn't be bad wrong it's bad as anything can be there is so much to laugh at and it's not the jokes for instance in one scene walks into the forest and when he comes out he is suddenly wearing a completely different outfit where was the director's brain when he shot that scene probably the same place <UNK> was when he agreed to do this flick it's truly a shame one has to see such a fine actor go dumb in this poor excuse for a film br br <UNK> performance in this movie can be called acting jack <UNK> is brought in just to bring up the star count here but all he does is looking <UNK> in a very dark and awfully shot scene in some kind of bar not to mention the indians the girl was so <UNK> i wanted to shoot her just to end her misery and mine as well if i could give this a 0 i would shame that mark doesn't exist here this truly reminds of a bad joke or an amateur footage made just for fun this should serve as a proof of how bad b movies can get
<START> i can't quite explain why i find this so <UNK> and the <UNK> not it may be because the focus here is on all that was great with that film those intimate moments that visconti can render so <UNK> like that film it has a <UNK> slow pace but this time it isn't overlong it's the kind of film where nothing happens but twenty minutes passes like that i think that must be due in part to the way the film deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini story like the <UNK> it has a sympathetic lead who brings out the same kind of worn pathos though performance is more willing to open itself to being unlikable especially in look he has a really stupid grin that's easy to dislike it's often quite beautiful in the quiet moments it's the <UNK> of <UNK> films the <UNK> of the ball scenes that i find tedious as they exchange individual clarity with mass <UNK> but here that is part of the point <UNK> surrounded by a visual din br br the way in which the object of affection is introduced to us is quite brilliant the camera shows a girl girl girl then this beautiful feminine featured boy it's like an <UNK> to shakespeare's and it doesn't feel heavy handed it's not until the camera views fully pulls back and we see his long <UNK> legs that we realize he is not a boy but an adolescent at first we're forced to question attraction in an uncomfortable way visconti must have known that and he doesn't shy away from it visconti is extremely patient with <UNK> we get a sense of the man we know him it's a largely silent performance and when he does open his mouth it's to <UNK> <UNK> no wonder he wants the <UNK> open featured boy to project himself onto there's a difference with we never know him just as we never know a handful of fellini <UNK> but that's because his life is another its own film but it's not as <UNK> as it's been made to seem there is one scene however where he <UNK> around a pole that's too much isn't necessarily leading him on he's looking at him visconti just <UNK> in is all br br the film doesn't detail <UNK> as being gay isn't even really male he's a version of a boy delicate pale <UNK> with golden locks that everyone seems to love including one gorgeous slightly older young man who he <UNK> with the closest they go to showing what could be understood as a reference to homosexuality is the famous <UNK> scene which <UNK> his repressed vanity br br it isn't totally successful the whole section with alfred is a waste and some unnecessary scenes people carrying <UNK> in long shot could have been <UNK> some parts are heavy handed such as when boat pulls in and <UNK> boys pass him by the looks on his face are too obvious but during the same scene <UNK> throws a fit wanting a new something so <UNK> that it makes up for it but there are some scenes touching for the first time that build up a remarkable quiet intensity repeating a piano song again and again the notes <UNK> in the air may be the best example of the anxiety the film has there is one discussion that contains a debate i'm especially interested can art be spiritual if it <UNK> the senses or does it have to go beyond them we can consider <UNK> who both visconti and mann to be the prime example of someone going beyond mere <UNK> <UNK> i think this one manages to do both 9 10
<START> seeing this film brought back to me memories of 9 11 the first thing i remember of that morning was seeing tv pictures of an airplane flying into a large building and my immediate thoughts must be a preview for a new tom <UNK> film br br this was not a tom <UNK> film this was certainly not a british version of the sum of all fears the typical tom <UNK> film or novel has a relatively small cast a linear plot and usually some sort of resolution this film had neither sure what i saw directly on screen was a small cast a plot and a vague resolution but like 9 11 the point was that reality was so much larger and more complex br br i work in systems planning and the reality of the disaster <UNK> exercise and the disaster itself is painfully obvious it's impossible to prepare for a disaster like this nor will it be any more possible to deal with this when it happens br br from the argument between the police not enough is being done to prepare and the politicians giving everybody on the tube a would cause panic to the constant <UNK> <UNK> you are in no danger to your health but don't go home before we you and don't eat drink or smoke before we you i was on edge during the entire film not the slightest urge to channel surf br br this film was 90 minutes in length it could have been twice that and still not shown all the possible details instead it left enough <UNK> to allow each of us to imagine the details each of us in our own way that made it so much more real to me than any tom <UNK> film br br i lived in london once and just off the road and i took the train from <UNK> station many times as i watched dirty war i kept telling myself that this is only fiction right now br br <UNK> and <UNK> willing this film will remain fiction and sometime in 20 or 30 years my <UNK> may watch this film and remember the early 21st century and the panic we felt too much hopefully to the same degree as i feel currently when viewing <UNK> of the cold war with the evil communist regime of the mid 20th century and remember drop and cover <UNK> in school
<START> as an adventure mini series this is about as good as it gets i viewed it when it was originally shown on hbo <UNK> is totally believable in her role as philadelphia and the whole production was first rate see all 400 minutes of it if you can i highly recommend this mini series amazing that i can't rate it officially but for you readers users i will let you know it's a solid 10
<START> let me start out with saying i was very surprised with the production value of this movie i managed to catch an early showing and i have to say this is the best if not only christian film to hit theaters since the passion br br don't let the pg 13 rating scare you off the rating is appropriate because of the serious issues that are dealt with in this film divorce teen <UNK> drug use and suicide but nothing in the film is gratuitous this is definitely a movie that a junior high youth group could see without <UNK> most parents and the message is wonderful the best part is this is not a film for christians it is a family film without the cheesy <UNK> heaven feel br br the laughs are there and several times in the theater everyone was laughing the bits of humor were natural and didn't seem scripted or forced and that made for good pacing in such a serious film teens and young adult both religious and otherwise will be able to identify with many if not all of the characters in the film and i was surprised to see such issues dealt with in this kind of film the plot is not in any way predictable and by the end hits closer to home than many will admit christians fortunately are not shown as all mighty know it <UNK> of the word but instead people just trying to understand life humans make mistakes and no one is perfect not even in this film not by a long shot br br the acting is top notch the writing spot on and you aren't hit over the head with all the preachy christian <UNK> this is a great film that will make you and your teens think talk and perhaps question their own morality or lack thereof if you want to see a quality family film in january check your local <UNK> for this film and you might learn something about yourself br br and i am a 25 year old male that just wanted to see a free movie
<START> before i took a job as a reviewer i never went to films like this and thus remained <UNK> unaware that at the soul of the hollywood film lies a deeply woman hating spirit that <UNK> on putting its knocking little knees on the silver screen for all to either empathize with or <UNK> or is this just a particularly bad year an ugly trend br br here we have yet another seemingly sweet innocent beautiful woman turned lethal weapon the kind that <UNK> us that beneath every pair of <UNK> eyes and <UNK> instincts lies a wild eyed beast guaranteed to make everyone's life within 50 miles a living hell br br this <UNK> <UNK> is jewel <UNK> <UNK> tyler whose simple dreams include having her own little house a backyard <UNK> and a <UNK> home entertainment system unfortunately randy matt dillon in his first film in 3 years the dim <UNK> bartender she picks up at one night <UNK> to rob is less <UNK> oriented the kind of guy who drinks beer out of a toilet he prefers to down in his dead mother's house with few creature <UNK> save his collection br br in that same low rent bar the devil in the red dress also <UNK> into <UNK> cousin carl the highly amusing paul reiser a lawyer with an ego the size of st louis when things go south within hours enter the widowed detective with a heart of gold john goodman the result three men sustain big bad <UNK> on the <UNK> clad <UNK> of steven tyler and <UNK> <UNK> that make them do things that common sense would normally like get involved in the first place br br multiple points of view and flashbacks <UNK> together the front page news about how easy it is to fall victim to one's <UNK> especially if you're male as each of these men relates his perspective to a <UNK> his desire to possess the jewel colors the <UNK> of the situation about 70 minutes later things come together in a reasonably amusing way but it's amusement from the same source that tells you that the stuff on the popcorn actually tastes like <UNK> br br is the first film by norwegian commercial and music video director <UNK> and his <UNK> is clear during some of the fantasy segments including one about a car wash soap and a <UNK> that you can probably it's also the debut project from the production company owned by michael douglas who's found his <UNK> as a in a <UNK> <UNK> br br dillon and tyler are unlikely to win any gold <UNK> for this one though given the one <UNK> of their overdone film noir type characters you can't really fault them several minor roles drag out unexpected guests <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> psychiatrist and andrew <UNK> clay <UNK> as both the <UNK> <UNK> and his even scarier brother finally an <UNK> for all that <UNK> br br this film <UNK> speaks volumes about the dynamics between men and women or men and their <UNK> but ultimately you'd probably find more lasting psychological truths in a bugs bunny episode i will say that it's better funnier more sophisticated than other recent gems like but should we really have to choose what to see based on what ranks lowest on the scale
<START> having spent the six years previous writing and producing luc returns to the directors chair with angel a i'm a huge fan of and quite liked the <UNK> of a black and white french film from the same <UNK> br br <UNK> is a liar and gambling addict <UNK> money to almost every <UNK> shark in paris unable to <UNK> his <UNK> and fed up with being held over the edge of the <UNK> tower he decides to kill himself he happens to do so at the same time as a mysterious woman who he decides to save determined to thank him she begins to help him fix his own life br br the film starts with some laughs which run well throughout the visuals are quite nice and work well with the sights of paris but that is it that's all the film has got going for it and these mere two <UNK> can do nothing to hold back the <UNK> of terrible film making the movie <UNK> though i can't hugely fault the main character his inconsistencies are close though the eponymous one is ghastly a terrible screen presence and <UNK> annoying the plot is ridiculously inconsistent itself and at times <UNK> silly particularly the ending an ending which completely <UNK> the <UNK> redemption <UNK> by the scenes immediately prior to it perhaps the most ridiculous scene i've had the <UNK> of <UNK> it is stupid indulgent melodramatic and considerably too awful to be so bad it's funny the overall premise of the film could <UNK> have once held potential but it is brutally <UNK> by the terrible <UNK> of its ideas the film really was a task to watch and one which had me screaming at the screen the whole way through br br <UNK> and <UNK> flawed angel a is just plain bad though its occasionally fun dialogue manages to draw out <UNK> at rare <UNK> by the end it is clear that this film is nothing more than <UNK>
<START> at the end of my review of <UNK> i wrote that i was intrigued with <UNK> as a film maker this is what led me to get the dvd for la <UNK> which i just finished watching about a half hour ago br br it's all been expressed here at imdb and in many of the <UNK> reviews the <UNK> twisted <UNK> that would <UNK> an individual like <UNK> erika who is still trying after years and years to please her mother at the expense of everyone and everything else in her life beginning with her self she's repressed everything that would free her from her self <UNK> bondage including of course her sexuality which has literally <UNK> to the point of madness to where she can no longer even begin to comprehend what a genuine loving <UNK> would feel like br br this is a graphic portrait of a severe emotional <UNK> one who never found the strength to get out of her childhood situation and become a <UNK> adult i think this subject relates to all of us we're all <UNK> for <UNK> but there are needs so many <UNK> needs most of which are not even on the conscious level it also deals brilliantly with the contrast between what one <UNK> about sexually and the reality of those fantasies as well as the consequences of choosing to share one's sexual fantasies with another human being <UNK> character gets what she asks for in the course of the film and it is hardly the experience she had imagined it to be br br regarding the much discussed scene in the bathroom i really appreciated how this sequence had all the possible erotic charge for the viewer i mean sucked out of it because of the prior scene where she put the glass in the girl's pocket by the time she's acting out her let's see if this guy is worthy scenario in the bathroom we've already found out that she's dangerously disturbed and so it's not a turn on her little <UNK> session with our poor unsuspecting <UNK> br br i think another incredible achievement of this movie is how about halfway through it i completely forgot that it was not in english and that i was reading sub titles that has never happened before in any foreign movie and i've seen quite a few br br in this film like <UNK> the ending is not all wrapped up in a nice little <UNK> bow but unlike <UNK> we do at least get some sense of <UNK> despite the fact that we do not even know for sure whether <UNK> character is alive or dead after experiencing la <UNK> when it comes to michael <UNK> i am needless to say more than a <UNK> intrigued
<START> the great dictator is arguably one of charlie <UNK> most widely known films it is notorious for it's blatant satire of <UNK> hitler and <UNK> until watching it i only knew of it's fame now i know how much the film deserves it br br the film basically shows the exploits of the somewhat clumsy ambitious short <UNK> and impressive dictator of and with him his near and dear staff field marshall <UNK> and <UNK> also it <UNK> the exploits of an <UNK> emotional and often clumsy jewish <UNK> a veteran of the first world war br br stopping with the plot i would like to say that this film has various qualities that make it both unique and wonderful while the comedy is decidedly both verbal and slapstick and incidental the entirety of the film shows how serious it takes <UNK> or aggressive <UNK> as a theme with various <UNK> <UNK> impeccable acting skills range far and wide in the film he keeps it up and up until he simply explodes position as an ambitious jewish would be and henry delivery of a <UNK> calm as death serious as a heart attack lines makes for wonderful viewing br br further one aspect of the film is what makes it so special it pulls no punches it isn't <UNK> it has no business being <UNK> it is an overt blatant in your face obvious <UNK> of both hitler and <UNK> br br to sum up briefly watch it just watch it you'll see it
<START> this movie i've seen many times i read the book which was written by who received the <UNK> book awards for the work the movie does not start on the same place as the book starts it happens in and the main character is young and having a good life with his girlfriend but as she breaks up the relationship with him he starts to get some <UNK> which make him annoyed and angry and soon he starts to have big mental problems and then the movie begins soon he is in the <UNK> mental hospital called and there you get to see some great characters like <UNK> who thinks he is hitler and who thinks that he writes all the the beatles songs and sends them to them with mind <UNK> e who has the role of the main character does is so work so well that it leaves you breathless also the music in this movie is mad by and just for the <UNK> cost you should see the movie overall a great movie meant to be seen
<START> i agree with the comments regarding the <UNK> spin the last view shows have been a little better but surely the writers need some more direction i think the characters are still interesting although sometimes they spin into the white trash things a little too much subtlety and nuance goes a long way on shows like office i would think the target audience is somewhat similar being they are both on the same night and <UNK> one would think that <UNK> and the whole eastern religion thing is a big enough topic to bring some different and interesting shows but they only scratch the surface of the subject in my opinion it shows the contempt that many people have in hollywood about the level of intelligence of the masses we can handle more <UNK> content it has been proved before in many other shows
<START> an incredible performance this is one of the best films i have seen ever i know this is being said a lot but i bet you will not regret watching this film br br it's great from the very beginning to the last second the acting of especially the mother played by <UNK> light is so convincing there are not many other films i've seen that could compare to it and it seems it's impossible not to feel anything for the people in this drama br br there are lots and lots of movies made every year but if you have to choose just to see a few in your life make this one of them
<START> terrible absolutely terrible long confusing and <UNK> after about three hours of this painful mess the ending truly is the final nail in the coffin not even the magnificent sexy beautiful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> can save this poor adaptation of agatha <UNK> work the plot drags and drags and time goes by slowly and suddenly you realize that you don't even have any idea of what's going on anymore by the end even with the usual explanation by the villain there's still a lot that's left unexplained and <UNK> it's over a complete waste of time and without a doubt one of the worst to bear the name of agatha christie
<START> where to start with the true story of richard <UNK> a killer of eight <UNK> in the 1960s director keith has worked on a few of the extremely low budget full moon releasing movies such as birth <UNK> and here works from a script by at the time full moon regular don adams whilst the film seems like a accurate portrayal of the horrendous crime the script isn't great perhaps because the real <UNK> were not terribly interesting despite the care that has been taken to make this authentic it <UNK> of a cheap cash in of the acclaimed cinematic serial killer movies of the same period such as <UNK> filmed in a dirty brown not quite <UNK> for the most part and narrated by star doug cole the film fails to present the horror of the crime because the narration is irritating the <UNK> distracting from the story and the crime though gruesome and <UNK> to watch is merely that and no <UNK> work seems to have occurred on what is pretty much a very poor quality camcorder viewing on the events there is no examination of the motivation or of life really just a cheap shot at a gruesome crime released by full moon there is little evidence of full <UNK> better <UNK> here charles band ignoring his own rule that his films feature fantasy killings e g dolls monsters and so on and not quite knowing what to do with this new reality incidentally band introduced a special label for these films called <UNK> band has said that he regrets the period of full moon <UNK> alongside <UNK> entertainment whose creator j r and regular danny also speak very badly of charles band the <UNK> era features uniform apple mac editing and brutal hand held camera filming very much like a home movie <UNK> <UNK> these qualities and whereas 3 for example managed to use these well <UNK> is merely boring and gross
<START> what a sad surprise br br being a die hard fan of the original series starring don adams i was really looking forward to this poor fool me this is <UNK> and more brain dead than a <UNK> bottom br br to say it was bad would be a severe understatement it is was the worst movie well first 30 minutes of one i have seen for a long time i couldn't stand more than the first half hour <UNK> to watch my hard drive de <UNK> br br i can tolerate bad bad is o k sometimes even cute but up with contrived hollywood crap and this has to be the worst in many years i will not put this movie is a gross insult to the collective intelligence of humanity my five year old daughter could have written better and she is not even i'm really tempted to try watching the rest of it but i'm afraid i have better things to do like making pizza <UNK> and watching it rise br br what a sad disappointment no i'm off what a <UNK> as mel once said piece of shirt
<START> chick flick of course been done before many times predictable yes worth watching you bet i was delighted with sarandon and <UNK> portrayals of otherwise stock characters in a familiar story line i am a great fan of mother daughter stories what makes the difference between the good ones and the weak ones are the performances and the character development although this is not the best of its genre i will buy it and watch it again i felt the characters were believable and the acting was superior
<START> <UNK> stands out in this movie because of her personal sense of style and the way the clothes hang on her i have learned to hate that <UNK> little three year old face she makes whenever she pretends to cry it makes any points she is trying to make as a serious actress drop off quickly of course in a movie with a baldwin and denise she still shines as a mature actor person david seemed to be doing woody allen by way of <UNK> <UNK> not a single word or gesture in the entire movie seemed sincere or even sincerely acted how harry met sally and two <UNK> and funeral even <UNK> in seattle had scripts locations and actors the script seemed to be a string of bad and crude gags separated by a lot of talking the locations seemed to be within a few <UNK> of each other there are only two actors in this of an indie flick <UNK> and the lady who played the chick who was into the stars i watched most of this through the first time with the sound off just watching <UNK> that gag was old the first time i saw it and it's a silly rip off of a song in how to succeed in business without really trying
<START> a very bad film an <UNK> of clichés and historical inaccuracies a few examples in an early scene soviet <UNK> are attacked by the germans instead of staying in their <UNK> to shoot at them they advance into open ground to fight them contrary to all <UNK> tactics kate one of the central characters is supposedly the daughter of a white russian and obsessed with her <UNK> yet she does not speak russian a guilt stricken german <UNK> attacks an anti aircraft gun the gun however does not fire <UNK> but scores a direct hit on his which doesn't look much like a german of wwii in fairness when they could escape the preposterous plot and the <UNK> <UNK> there are some genuinely powerful moments the depiction of people slowly starving to death is convincingly done and moving but these only show up the rest of it even more a film to be avoided
<START> this is the absolutely worst show in the history of <UNK> first of all no <UNK> school has a <UNK> bar flat screen <UNK> and gives every student a <UNK> this makes the show so unrealistic and boring the plots are pointless and incredibly boring the actors are so bad it makes me want to take my own life i really hate the fact that in the show <UNK> is the most popular girl in school and the <UNK> and <UNK> and gets the best <UNK> without doing any work she never has any real problems and every guy wants to date her she is so perfect there isn't anyone like that also i hate that everyone would do anything for her and everyone picks her for every team or club it is so annoying quinn is so obnoxious her experiments are pathetic pointless and fake chase is such a <UNK> he says he loves <UNK> but if he told her it would ruin their friendship how pathetic michael tries to be funny but he never <UNK> anything <UNK> is so <UNK> and screams a lot she is never seen doing any work or studying but she is a straight a student lola thinks she is an actress but she sucks excuse my language need i say more i think no for your own good stay away from this show at all costs
<START> i feel terribly sorry where the lubitsch <UNK> was enchanting marvelous full of spirit and <UNK> this one here is only colored <UNK> looks like <UNK> in fact she was <UNK> at that time but obviously <UNK> and tries to play a shy and dull <UNK> think of <UNK> <UNK> who gave the role of the widow a double faced depth by playing with count that <UNK> had to play an <UNK> although unable to sing crazy she only sings one song the title role of an <UNK> <UNK> that is really funny the only really good thing is the great <UNK> scene at the end glamorous and after watching this scene have a look at the introducing <UNK> scene in gentlemen prefer <UNK> any similarities
<START> the cell 2000 rating 8 10 br br the cell like <UNK> must be watched twice to be appreciated the first time i saw this film i thought it was mediocre but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing i decided i had to rent it again i did and i found the film to be much more likeable the cell is not for everyone but it <UNK> its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched the film's script can be clunky at times as can the acting but the visuals are ingenious and bring the engaging story to an exotic and intriguing life the oscar nominated makeup is also daring and careful while the beautiful costumes and utterly brilliant set decoration went <UNK> <UNK> who has also directed music videos goes totally crazy with his direction and it results well he has major talent and this film has a lot of potential if you give it a chance overall the cell is a powerful disturbing and avoids being too tacky which makes it a great <UNK> watch
<START> the entire series not just the blue planet is nothing short of amazing the best nature series we have ever seen the episode on the deep is like traveling to outer space we have watched this with our 10 and 7 year old boys and all four of us have not been able to pull away we read a negative comment on this and could not believe it there is so much new information that we never learned in school its also the best view we have seen from any television or movie into the delicate balance of our <UNK> <UNK> system the amount of time and effort put into capturing these shots is very much apparent when you sit down and watch this series br br a must see for everyone
<START> brilliant <UNK> br br well this certainly is one of my very <UNK> <UNK> movie this movie came as a total surprise to me i had been avoiding this movie for a very very long time now that was because i am not a fan of jamie foxx i still am not a big fan of him but i sure am a fan now br br well he deserved every bit of that oscar his performance is one of the best performances i have seen in a long long time he is truly sensational br br well the narration or the flow of the story is brilliant for a <UNK> movie i am a drama fan so i wasn't bored at all br br i was way too much surprised to have being liking the movie so much that i did not see any flaws in the movie i think there isn't any flaw in the movie maybe some events errors but hey who cares br br the performance by the woman who plays <UNK> mother was also really good and well <UNK> washington  she has so much potential if given the right role she might just be the next oscar winner br br well the story of them movie was so emotional so touching i i cried very br br i don't give a damn if the things were mad up or not <UNK> this movie mad me and that's a lot for me br br all in all a superb one of the very best of this century br br 10 10
<START> small spoilers i just bought the dvd of this movie yesterday i saw it with my friends and i couldn't believe what had happened br br in the first 3 movies the <UNK> at least had a sense of humor especially the 3rd movie but not only did the <UNK> barely ever make an appearance they weren't funny they never made me laugh i must admit that the story did start off nicely after an hour had gone by i remembered that the <UNK> movies were always very short so i thought to myself where the are the <UNK> they were barely in this movie if that didn't make me mad enough the boy named ethan was sitting on his bed after charlie had murdered the ship and he knew that the <UNK> were still on board in the first movie the brown family was scared out of their minds but here ethan didn't even care it was as if the <UNK> weren't even a threat br br now what i'm about to say next may ruin the ending but i'm going to say it anyways in the first movie at the end they had to face the giant <UNK> for a final battle in the second one there was the great ball of <UNK> in the third movie the <UNK> with his <UNK> burned did a from <UNK> the <UNK> and was going to attack the little kid but at the end of the fourth one which is what made me the the bald <UNK> charges toward ethan and ethan kills it as if it were nothing br br now something that i really don't understand was what happened to <UNK> he was one of my favorite characters in the first two then after 50 years he's evil that was very disappointing not only that but wasn't he a <UNK> bounty hunter why was he still johnny steele plus he seemed to have a different personality he seemed much smarter and not as <UNK> like in the first two br br being someone who actually enjoyed the first two <UNK> movies and loved the third one i give <UNK> 4 a 2 10
<START> i was actually looking forward to this movie the commercials made it look real cool and action packed and i heard that claire character was arrested for assault so i thought that maybe she would kick a lot of ass and that would be cool but their was hardly any action at all and the character were all kinda bland the only saving grace was omar <UNK> and even he didn't help this movie much
<START> i love watching steven seagal movies not because of the action of the great plot holes but just because it makes me laugh br br oh it makes me laugh so hard this movie totally got no point and is ridiculous compared to this movie pearl harbor rocks and ben affleck need no acting school at all just to give a impression how bad it is br br first off all there so many goofs and bad acting its just getting worse like when steven is try to get out of jail a <UNK> lands at first the security notice and they led them land when they fly away all of the sudden a guard start shooting br br or when he killed that guy in the car he and both walk away you can't see no oil on the ground behind him steven notice that there is oil without even watching a lighter and the car blows up br br and there are plenty of more goofs steven uses his basic action when someone is pointing a gun at him he grabs it and shoot him totally <UNK> like some gangster would let that ever happen br br the acting is also very worse at the fight scene in the jail <UNK> place you can see steven clearly wait to come in action just <UNK> it a couple of time and you notice the bad acting br br its just makes me laugh i hope one day it comes to the <UNK> here in holland then i'll go there with as many friends as possible just to laugh my self to death
<START> this was the next to last film appearance by jill ireland who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a well known actress and producer ireland made quite a few waves in the press when she dropped her then husband david <UNK> in 1967 beginning her long relationship with charles bronson it is a great irony that bronson probably the all time leader in number of deaths rendered on screen had one of the most enduring <UNK> in film history br br seems to be a movie that was <UNK> into <UNK> production schedule for the sake of bronson and ireland ireland was already suffering from cancer related <UNK> in 1987 and you can almost picture the two actors wanting to do <UNK> one more for old <UNK> sake ' is <UNK> done as a whole showing the lack of polish and <UNK> <UNK> that would tank cannon by 1990 but there's a kind of nostalgia value in seeing the couple together one last time and the film makes you wonder what exactly helps a relationship to survive in the chaos that is hollywood br br bronson plays jay <UNK> a high <UNK> secret service agent who is assigned to protect the first lady lara craig ireland the <UNK> wife has a reputation for being difficult <UNK> service agents around and wanting to do things her own way that all changes however when attempts are made on her life and she must journey with <UNK> by car train <UNK> and believe it or not <UNK> <UNK> to escape would be <UNK> there is little surprise here as <UNK> believes the murderers are part of an inside job perhaps arranged by the president himself on the way <UNK> and mrs craig develop an <UNK> affection for one another in scenes between bronson and ireland that are actually very funny br br what really gets me is how this film was promoted upon its release and how it's still made to look as a dvd the original trailer gives you the feeling that is another cold hearted bronson shoot 'em up but a lot of this movie which was rated pg 13 by the way is in a comic vein putting it along the lines of a romantic thriller like bronson and <UNK> western <UNK> <UNK> till three ' even the dvd case shows bronson with a rocket <UNK> ready to blow things up which he does but to a lesser degree than his other '80s <UNK> br br on the whole is late cannon <UNK> work and doesn't really know what kind of film it wants to be besides <UNK> from <UNK> to romantic thriller and back again there are serious mistakes in continuity property values are bottom of the barrel cheap and the effects are dreadful many of the explosions seem like <UNK> work rather than being done on location robert <UNK> who had shown good <UNK> skills in earlier films teamed up with valentine <UNK> on a score that is mostly <UNK> and better fit for television br br richard <UNK> script has real of dialogue with the conversations between bronson and ireland the only bright spot there is no explanation as to why the first lady is called <UNK> all of a sudden nor as to why ireland is left with her british accent when the character is a <UNK> native jan <UNK> playing main assistant has a <UNK> like personality and is badly miscast as a federal agent stephen elliott a former tony award <UNK> who died in may 2005 randy brooks <UNK> stern as assassin <UNK> and michael senator <UNK> are acceptable in their supporting roles br br incidentally this was the last film directing gig for peter hunt who broke onto the scene with <UNK> her <UNK> secret <UNK> in 1969 and <UNK> with bronson and lee marvin on <UNK> <UNK> in 1981 is available on dvd through mgm home entertainment it is presented in <UNK> widescreen and standard format with three language subtitles and theatrical trailer br br out of 4
<START> this is one of my personal favorites a rare little gem that seems to be <UNK> by the general population chris cooper and patricia <UNK> form the heart of the piece in what is a well chosen cast few movies have ever captured the true <UNK> that the civil war but this one seems to capture all the right tones and <UNK> if you're a fan of the book cold mountain try this movie out and see if you don't think it makes a good companion piece
<START> i loved this movie the actors were wonderful and suited their roles the story itself was great and true the setting was perfect and the message about human response to the war danger and risk was exceptional the person who wrote the music score also did the music for life is beautiful another favourite of mine his comment was apparently that this was not a like an english movie it was like an italian movie i think he's right <UNK> blue is perfect for the part of eric i recommend this movie to everyone who wants to watch a story that is true and morally uplifting as well as a beautiful love story
<START> frankie <UNK> was a wonderful child actor who <UNK> at playing little <UNK> with gigantic <UNK> on their shoulders he appeared in a couple of top films of the early 30s the public enemy 1931 a ground breaking crime drama and wild boys of the road 1933 a <UNK> depression era movie about kids who ride the <UNK> he was essentially a younger version of james cagney although short of height his <UNK> to do his own stunts kept him employed in a series of <UNK> when the bigger studios had no more use for him br br crime school was supposed to be a remake of the mayor of hell but it had far more humour in it and featured the dead end kids and <UNK> bogart as a very laid back deputy the mayor of hell is really a combination of <UNK> house crime school boy's town even though cagney didn't make his appearance until around the <UNK> minute his impact as usual was immediate he plays a hot headed gangster who is on the <UNK> of a political group run by the mob br br jimmy smith frankie <UNK> and his gang including <UNK> from our gang run a car <UNK> <UNK> but bite off more than they can chew when they rob a general store and push the owner through a plate glass window they appear before the juvenile court and are sentenced to go to the state <UNK> it is painted in glowing terms a model school where boys are given a chance to learn a trade in reality it is a <UNK> place run by a sadistic warden mr thompson <UNK> played by dudley <UNK> the only compassionate person is dorothy griffith the live in nurse played by <UNK> evans br br <UNK> <UNK> james cagney has been given the job as the new deputy <UNK> as a favour on his arrival at the school he witnesses a failed escape attempt and after talking to dorothy realises the school needs sweeping <UNK> he is soon running the school and brings in a system of self government rather along the lines of boy's town even though cagney doesn't have a lot to do the picture is carried along to it's gripping climax by the energy of <UNK> after <UNK> is <UNK> out of the picture he accidentally shoots a mobster and has to leave the state thompson returns and his brutal treatment resulting in the death of a boy skinny turn the rest of the boys into an angry mob they burn down a <UNK> and thompson falls to his death <UNK> returning just in time to the mob with some <UNK> talk br br sure all the boys seemed to get was a stiff talking to for their crimes but i do disagree with one of the reviewers thompson was more than just a <UNK> his sadistic treatment resulted in a boy's death there is a scene at the beginning where the boys are served some <UNK> <UNK> thompson orders ham and eggs and keeps <UNK> the <UNK> on his bread while talking to dorothy br br allan <UNK> plays uncle mike and sheila terry although billed only as a blonde has one of the most memorable lines when she <UNK> and says i thought there was going to be young boys here where are they br br highly recommended
<START> i gave this 2 stars out of a possible 10 br br i went into this not realizing what it was and discovered it is apparently some kind of african musical since people break into song every few minutes br br none of the songs rhyme most of them aren't really saying anything sensible and they all have the same non existent tune if you could call it a tune br br is a tall spectacularly built young woman with the longest <UNK> i've ever seen the actress looks as if she has probably done some <UNK> br br the film opens in a women's prison although not like any prison i've ever seen or heard of the inmates wear whatever they wish and seem to be having a party br br does some frantic dancing and the woman warden of the prison <UNK> a <UNK> handsome woman is definitely <UNK> interested she and dance together later visits the <UNK> room and they make love unfortunately the scene is not detailed and is very short although there is some nudity br br then escapes from the prison and next we see her dancing in front of another group where a man named maybe a colonel it was never really clear who he was watches her he is with a young woman who <UNK> seductive dancing and there is a dance off between the two women br br after that the story such as it is becomes even more muddled br br with in jail out of jail and who knows where br br may be involved with a group of <UNK> or thieves br br there is more singing more dancing and a scene of <UNK> obviously suffering from <UNK> br br the film <UNK> its way to a finish and i <UNK> a sigh of relief that it had ended br br br br
<START> it is a movie which <UNK> the light on the begging of the palestinian struggle against the israeli <UNK> of <UNK> but it does not show the real feelings of the people back then and how they were tricked into believing that they could return to their home soon it does not mention the <UNK> committed by the jews like der and how they tortured and killed and destroyed the family of any palestinian freedom fighter it lacks the credibility about the real palestinian struggle and about anything palestinian however it has something about the suffering of palestinian citizens ending up as <UNK> in the nearby arab countries the movie focuses on the story of the man in coma he is now in the present time and through his story we see the film the movie is just telling the life of one person and has some nudity scenes which are irrelevant to the story
<START> i don't know what has happened to director <UNK> <UNK> ever since the body <UNK> remake he seems to have lost it king of new york and the bad lieutenant remain two of the best films of the <UNK> <UNK> of a decade gone wrong with films like <UNK> <UNK> whatever that means and new rose hotel he seems determined to disgust and bore his former supporters this film has no life in it while he gets excellent performances out of his actors in all of his projects the result of this <UNK> of ideas just doesn't <UNK> whatever the point is that the new breed of drug dealer is more or less the same as any other upper middle class new gets lost in the mind numbing script and boring direction br br i saw this opening night at the 4 <UNK> in downtown l a in the <UNK> while buying tickets i was surprised and delighted to see it filled with a large <UNK> mixed group of men and women in their <UNK> and thirties then they started into the theater but it was the theater that was featuring 8 mile not <UNK> <UNK> the theater showing <UNK> <UNK> keep in mind this was opening night had a total of 4 people watching it myself my wife and two others br br way to go <UNK> br br 2 10
<START> i couldn't make heads or <UNK> out of this terrible film noir br br the plot was confusing the acting was alright but the picture quality was awful though i bought this at a double pack 8 movies on two <UNK> at <UNK> for 5 50 and when you put the dvd in it <UNK> for the awful picture quality that some of the movies may have br br the plot was flip <UNK> everywhere i couldn't understand it and had no idea what was going on then the end popped up and the movie was over br br what a waste of my time br br i say don't waste your money or time on this or if you too bought that double pack then just skip over this one br br 2 10
<START> i <UNK> onto the <UNK> mystery channel to wait for the movie i wanted to see island of dr <UNK> i caught only a few minutes of shadow conspiracy an old man runs to meet charlie and grabs him by the arm suddenly an assassin in a bright rain coat <UNK> the old man in the head with a side arm from across the street after waiting for c to turn around and look the a tries to shoot c and clearly misses c was a much easier target the old man couldn't have run far duh there is a chase and c is on an elevator a is on the roof so he tries to shoot the cable which is parallel to the a he hits and the cable impossible later this time with a <UNK> rifle the a lines up on c from maybe 50 <UNK> but is to stupid to notice a motorcycle coming up and <UNK> the rider instead how does charlie get his parts does daddy go to the producers and say look my kid needs work it reminds me of his stupid sit com all the actors are good except <UNK> you got it i usually have to 2 or 3 minutes of that waiting for c s i to come on let's see what can i do for the next hour i know i'll <UNK> my <UNK> much better use of my time
<START> this is supposedly a story in which a grown man tells a story about his youth yet you see things like personal computers e <UNK> <UNK> etc which are items used in the late 20th century and early 21st br br so when is this guy supposed to be telling this story in <UNK> gee i wonder how advanced we are then how about telling us that br br also there are several legal issues which also make no sense in the courtroom scene the story falls into the usual <UNK> of surprise evidence which is <UNK> in any real court of law in this country also grandma would have to be missing at least seven years in most states before to be <UNK> officially dead br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> you are now officially a <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> wrote this film 40 years back wanted to cast <UNK> kumar in the lead br br the film finally was re written and made in 2003 and hence the subject looks dated and too superficial at times br br like the reason amitabh <UNK> separate is too superficial even the way the youth are shown is too bad like <UNK> in br br the message though comes well but things are presented in a clichéd manner <UNK> character is the worst looks straight out of a <UNK> while the climax speech of bachchan is good and also the final of not <UNK> the sons is good br br <UNK> <UNK> does a good job music is decent the songs sung by bachchan stand out br br amitabh excels like always he has played an elder stern father earlier but here he plays a victim and portrays it well his last speech is great <UNK> is good in her part <UNK> <UNK> stands out <UNK> <UNK> is okay <UNK> and the rest sons and wives are decent though <UNK> <UNK> stands out salman khan is fake is okay <UNK> and <UNK> are lovable
<START> if it had been made 2 years later it would have been banned the number one must see recommendation of the day the best <UNK> film i have seen this far have but have not yet seen j h br br there's no wonder why this film got less than 200 votes a bigger that could not care less about what's proper would not be seen again until the 60's as morally ambiguous and dark as 70's <UNK> but with a certain charm as well of course this had to lay low in the later 30's and sadly it does not appear to have been re discovered br br seriously this got it all great actors gary cooper sylvia sidney and the this time not so lovable guy <UNK> and a mighty good director this far i haven't been biggest fans but i have liked his films a lot and with this he steps into a new league one of the best 30's films i have ever seen this is something i never thought even existed 9 5 10
<START> joe whole act is profanity laced with <UNK> he is a pot <UNK> who entered fear factor thinking it was a joke he said he would egg people on because he did not know how stupid people were going to be the producers of the show he explained were going on the premise of playing pranks on unsuspecting contestants to see how far they will go the level of evil involved is a little twisted mr special is just filled with the <UNK> of someone who is too good for regular human beings i found him to be offensive and his stuff can be heard by more talented comedians such as eddie murphy or chris rock even does a five minute set on the n word overall ignore this special
<START> the storyline of the stranger mirrors somewhat the 1969 film journey to the far side of the sun made by <UNK> sylvia anderson of <UNK> and <UNK> fame a parallel universe earth is the premise of both films but there is a difference where the world in the stranger features a <UNK> regime out to <UNK> the freedom of the <UNK> journey to the far side of the sun merely showed a true mirror world where <UNK> roads houses <UNK> of every kind and of course internal organs were all in reverse or <UNK> order so the similarity of parallel <UNK> is the only connection of both films br br similarly the tv series land of the giants came before both of those films having run from 1968 to 1970 it featured a world that was nearly parallel to the earth with the exception that the planet was populated by giants 12 times the size of the humans who crash landed there the idea of a <UNK> government out to capture and contain the <UNK> <UNK> was similar to the premise of the stranger more so than the premise of perhaps because of the similarly to a series to the stranger was <UNK> had it turned into a tv series it would have been a sci fi version of the fugitive with star glenn corbett being chased by the baddies from week to week hiding out in different locations etc btw a stronger script could have helped this film along
<START> nice to see a comedy for grown ups masterfully structured by aaron via mike own <UNK> mr <UNK> is to present characters in all their shocking truth from the sad and riveting richard burton and elizabeth taylor in who's afraid of virginia <UNK> to the sad and riveting julia roberts clive owen jude law and natalie portman in closer in charlie <UNK> war the shocking truth is outside the characters and the sad and riveting tom hanks julia roberts philip seymour hoffman and amy adams are at the service of something else it's personal only to a point hanks has to bury his brilliance in single and julia roberts throws parties and introduces characters with blatant amy adams witnesses and exist as a character witnessing an <UNK> task that miss adams manages to <UNK> beautifully it is philip seymour <UNK> gus with a t however that <UNK> my attention his character may not be a first but it is a first the way that hoffman presented him to us someone who survives the disregard with which he's treated by the absolute conviction that he's smarter than all of them put together hoffman is superb the pacing of the tale helps enormously not to fall in a <UNK> of useless questions a sharp short smart sad comedy and when was the last time i was able to say that
<START> i have seen this movie twice once a few years ago in college and again this past weekend although i absolutely <UNK> it the first time i decided to give it another chance <UNK> <UNK> is clearly a well respected director and it seems that the imdb viewers at least think very highly of the film but unfortunately it seems my tastes haven't changed at all br br where to start for one thing linda narration is horrific her voice is so irritating with that horrendous new york accent please don't try and convince me that talk that way they don't she herself admitted to just sitting down and talking about random things which does not make her a talented actress she's not even acting i came on imdb expecting to see her ripped apart since her performance is just so utterly laughable but people actually seemed to like it she's simply unappealing in every way i kept hoping <UNK> would just kill her off br br the other actors were fine but certainly nothing special adams was probably the strongest in the cast but she also had the only decent part except the old guy he was pretty good br br speaking of acting how could <UNK> character be so ridiculously stupid he bought the brother and sister act because uh why would he buy that bill and <UNK> took every single opportunity to be <UNK> <UNK> as though they didn't realize that their lives <UNK> on acting in a very <UNK> way it was just completely unbelievable and finally after a considerable amount of time the farmer suddenly realizes that oh my god they're together then he goes after bill with a gun but instead seems to trip into <UNK> hand and ends up with a mortal stab wound br br speaking of which the fate of the characters was similarly stupid and dare i say lazy of course bill has to die could it be more boring than getting shot in a pond by a pack of cops <UNK> goes on with her happy life getting on a train and feeling really content about the way things worked out and the <UNK> narrator randomly finds her <UNK> friend and they wander off into the sunset but it's okay because <UNK> never gave me any reason to care about the characters anyway br br as for the plot this film drags along endlessly with no real plot twists or development i can't believe it's only <UNK> minutes long i could have <UNK> i was sitting in my seat for a solid 3 hours the sudden <UNK> disaster was like throwing the bible in my face i'm totally fine with <UNK> and <UNK> but this was completely over the top clearly the message was don't marry for money or bad things will happen to you very original br br i understand that days of heaven like all of <UNK> <UNK> films is meant to be a piece of art and i will certainly agree that the cinematography is simply stunning and the magic hour shots add a unique aura to the film but i need more than nice pictures to enjoy a film and this one just didn't do it for me
<START> this seventh yes you read right the seventh puppet master movie shows how the demented group of dolls came to be by a french <UNK> who uses them to get revenge on a group of ancient <UNK> who are after him once they learn that he holds the secret to life it was taught to him by a <UNK> also on the run before he died he used this power to bring normal puppets to life this sequel is basically nonsense <UNK> upon even more nonsense like most of the puppet master sequels due to the <UNK> rating we don't even get any entertaining puppet murders come to think of it there are no damn puppet murders if there was one franchise that needed to be cut off it would be this one no more god please no more
<START> i am a huge rupert everett fan i adore kathy bates so when i saw it available i decided to check it out the synopsis didn't really tell you much in parts it was silly touching and in others some parts were down right hysterical br br any person that is a huge fan of a personality of any type will find some small <UNK> traits with the main character of course there are many they won't but that is the point br br if you like any of the actors give it a watch but don't look for any thing too dramatic it's good fun br br i might also mention you can see how darn tall rupert is i mean i knew he was but he seems even more in this film he even seemed to <UNK> a bit due to the other characters height in this he is tall i mean tall and for you rupert fans there is a bare chest scene wonderful

<START> journalist bob <UNK> <UNK> and sometimes suspect account of actor john <UNK> rise and fall becomes a wholly <UNK> movie a <UNK> fantasy directed by larry as if he were doing something edgy and vital michael <UNK> years before his breakthrough on the shield is put in the <UNK> position of portraying belushi taking a post <UNK> trip through his life <UNK> those saturday night live skits which are now part of tv history it's like watching someone try to out lucy lucille ball it can't be done the reason why there was such sorrow at <UNK> death was because he was one of a kind <UNK> makes a commendable attempt at looking the part and he's funny in an early scene trying to escape from the <UNK> still it's an <UNK> venture and no actor no matter how talented could have saved it from
<START> it starts quite good but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are actually getting everything becomes unclear and unclear it stays czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago but after they <UNK> to <UNK> country here it is czech <UNK> but well known mentality <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of everything they consider good when they see it in another movies or countries or elsewhere i think that this is a good example of making art and politics and horror and humor and film and money and it remains me of the one flew over the <UNK> nest which can not be compared to this film in the way of art and actors and story and politics i think this film is boring it could be done better at least they tried sorry guys not recommend
<START> the only reason i am giving a second star is for the first half of the movie this was a good rendition of the story i enjoy seeing a few fictional characters added to add some color to a well known story but the second half was horrible yes there were violent aspects of this story but the writers of this movie chose to only include the violence and forget about the good things god did for the <UNK> towards the end of the movie scott looked as though he were getting messages from the big giant head instead of talking and hearing from god this rendition had some huge problems with <UNK> from <UNK> and big surprise there are no <UNK> <UNK> their portrayal of <UNK> as this screaming naked lunatic who did all of this against his will is totally false it showed a <UNK> who had to scream in order to get god to talk to him wrong the <UNK> says god spoke to <UNK> all the time and not just after a temper <UNK> they got the people's complaining right but failed to show that god spoke to <UNK> at in an <UNK> voice that the followers could hear and believe chapter 19 they also forgot the <UNK> of fire and cloud which guided them in the day and night br br what was the whole joshua thing the righteous peace loving jew who would not fight until <UNK> threatens him wrong he was known as a great warrior what about the great speech that <UNK> gave the army telling them god had helped them enough and now they were on their own wrong they only won through god's help as shown in their own scenes with <UNK> <UNK> his staff and what was that sorry looking <UNK> of the <UNK> instead of it with gold this movie was on a tight budget and attached little gold <UNK> to it oh yeah it was a <UNK> <UNK> not a straw one with little <UNK> tacked on someone forgot that they came out of egypt with a huge amount of gold tribute from the <UNK> you wouldn't know it from this sorry looking bunch br br by the way the part about them <UNK> the <UNK> after the golden <UNK> incident says men and does not mention women and children which the movie delighted in showing the viewers oh yeah <UNK> wasn't the only thing sent from heaven don't forget the birds for meat also the bible mentions <UNK> bringing <UNK> his wife and children and then says <UNK> went back to his own land it does not say that <UNK> gave up his family br br oh well if you know nothing about the real story read <UNK> for yourself if you know the real story you will hate this version
<START> as a writing teacher there are two ending i never allow my students to use then i woke up and then i got run over by a truck i am now going to add then i got a <UNK> on the head i feel it's utterly unfair to use these tricks to cover up a lack of imagination the whole issue of could have been handled with some intelligence and craft yet in this film they either couldn't or wouldn't do that i'm not saying it's totally worthless but it is so predictable in its progress except for the stupid ending there are even gangsters who go to the police to get help from this guy they should have done him in immediately it's just a forgettable borderline horror sci fi film with nothing new to offer
<START> in an early scene <UNK> david and james jeff are walking down a neighborhood street in chicago <UNK> the <UNK> architecture when a woman <UNK> arguing in french on a cell phone passes by them <UNK> james to remark there's nothing <UNK> than an angry french woman a few <UNK> later they pass an old <UNK> woman also angry also arguing on a cell phone and <UNK> remarks for <UNK> effect there's nothing <UNK> than an angry elderly <UNK> woman br br the humor in jeff i want someone to eat cheese with is best <UNK> by the word <UNK> the film is a conversation we might as well be <UNK> rather than go for antics the film relies on character flaws and human curiosity to deliver laughs while it's not innovative it is far from banal and even if james views himself as being rather <UNK> we know that he is fairly average and this him br br self <UNK> is the primary theme of the movie sarah silverman who plays beth is excellent as the <UNK> of change she <UNK> james and so reminds him to live a better life even so achieving some <UNK> dream is not the end of these characters but rather something simpler that they might pick up what pieces there are of the life they love just to keep for themselves at least enough to carry on br br a movie about life lessons can be overwrought as it can forget to connect with its audience i want someone to eat cheese with is subtle and <UNK> and while its moral may not be inspiring it is still <UNK> this is low key comedy but it will stick with you

<START> milo is a complete rip off of the 1992 slasher flick <UNK> if you actually check it up both films have the same <UNK> but if you want to watch an incredibly funny film with absolutely no plot whatsoever well then this is the film for you the acting is terrible and the flashback scenes are <UNK> confusing the story behind this atrocity is simple milo is a kid with serious family problems his father is an abortion doctor who keeps unborn in a jar nice and was desperate for a child of his own he figured out a way to bring one of these <UNK> children to life and he named him milo br br aside from all the bad acting terrible directing annoying sound of <UNK> voice and the ear <UNK> sound of the bell on his bike if you take away all that badness its still a bad but funny attempt at a film br br i'll give it a bank <UNK> 1 out of 10

<START> for many year i saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas but after study more about this culture i can only think this is just another karate film a black <UNK> and some weapons doesn't make a ninja it's much more than that the ninja are the most dangerous warrior of the japan because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive to anything killing whatever try to stop them this movie is not a about a ninja warrior just about a clown trying to be something he cannot even understand
<START> <UNK> talk about <UNK> this thing is brutal horrible voice dubbing even more horrible acting and no discernible plot apparently there are some great chase scenes but the problem is you have to get to that point first and i just couldn't the 20 or so minutes i endured felt more like a root <UNK> than a movie i suppose i could have fast <UNK> it and i recommend you do the same unless you have very extreme pain tolerance or your a <UNK> i don't fall into either category i still have a <UNK> from this thing so i'm about to perform some dental surgery without <UNK> just <UNK> the <UNK> bottom line horrendous 0 10

<START> set in the 1970s los angeles christopher <UNK> has just dropped out of <UNK> school and returned back home were his father gets him a job where he <UNK> intelligence documents his old friend lee is a <UNK> <UNK> drug dealer and gets caught in a set up and must choose between becoming a <UNK> or facing a long <UNK> in prison when up on <UNK> he jumps and heads to mexico city chris offers lee in a <UNK> to be his <UNK> to sell secret papers to the soviet union <UNK> in mexico city because of the disgrace he feels about the us <UNK> control over weaker countries to their own gain but over time the two begin to clash with their motivations and find themselves in something bigger then they had originally intended br br director john <UNK> has <UNK> out such films like the respectable midnight cowboy marathon man sunday bloody sunday and day of the <UNK> while the <UNK> and the snowman might not be held up that high there's no question that this <UNK> espionage drama inspired by a true incident is an <UNK> overlooked character portrait everything about it is quite a subdued affair with no real <UNK> qualities hitting a massive mark the driving factor of the film has got to be the admirably versatile lead performances of timothy <UNK> and sean penn as the two ambitious young <UNK> chris and penn is especially good with his uneasy intensity which works well off <UNK> superbly cool and <UNK> turn what starts off as easy we watch the situation gradually <UNK> as the two amateurs find themselves really out of their league the strongly detailed and symbolic <UNK> behaviour plot mainly <UNK> on the <UNK> relationship and that of their for their actions which eventually shows us the developments that led to their downfall the plan opens up like a wound to never properly <UNK> due to drug addiction which really makes him go off the <UNK> and leaves chris to pick up all the slack the <UNK> political aspect is there but it focus on the themes of <UNK> <UNK> and greed lee to get its point across both don't mix and results show suspense is justified through its stimulating pot <UNK> script and character interactions then that of any visual gimmicks action is very little but still there's a pressure induced style to <UNK> assured and realistically dark <UNK> gritty direction pacing is mostly well handled although some sequences do seem to <UNK> on for too long but however it grips you as it plays on its <UNK> paranoid tone to slowly build up to an exploding tight latter end <UNK> fleshed into the technical production is an harrowing music score and <UNK> poignant cinematography the supporting cast are exceptionally fine with pat <UNK> <UNK> singer david <UNK> boris jerry <UNK> and <UNK> van <UNK> also look out for michael <UNK> in a tiny part as a fbi agent br br a mostly outstanding spy film that benefits largely from talented lead performances and by not playing the usual stakes it's more an emotional ride then a complex one of twists recommended
<START> it would be quite easy to make this movie sound fun a call girl gets shot in the <UNK> by a north korean spy but survives the bullet that is <UNK> in her brain makes her long for knowledge as well as sex <UNK> to her she walks away from the shooting with the <UNK> finger of george w bush in her purse a key which can <UNK> the power to use nuclear <UNK> just call it a romp and at least a few people will show up to the theater i'm not sure how many did go to see this four year old film when it opened in new york this past april but i sincerely hope not many it sounds like a light and playful <UNK> flick but it has art house <UNK> and is really just incredibly boring many <UNK> films in the past have been successful in their artistic aspirations but this film's aspirations just make the time that <UNK> between the sex scenes excruciating and then the sex scenes aren't even good i've seen some pretty outrageous stuff in dirty japanese movies i've never seen this country produce something with sex this dull the spice channel is more imaginative the only worthwhile thing in this movie is the body of the lead actress <UNK> <UNK> otherwise this is pure torture
<START> i'm surprised that mine so far is the only comment on this t v movie as far as i'm aware the series itself has had a huge following reviewer <UNK> and real people alike have praised it to a person anyway let me tell you right away that if like me you're a sucker for gritty police dramas you'll like the lost child the heroine throughout the prime suspect series has been battling the male police establishment throughout the series getting to her present <UNK> powerful rank in the police <UNK> through hard work <UNK> and sheer talent for police work she is essentially an ambitious career woman but she has a romantic side and is certainly no man <UNK> unfortunately her relationships are affected by the wicked hours which her career demands and she has never married so when she finds herself pregnant from her latest affair she is faced with the choice of becoming a mother and her entire police job let alone future <UNK> or having an abortion which she <UNK> for this abortion never <UNK> large in the ensuing drama it's very <UNK> dealt with in less than a couple of minutes <UNK> a marvel of economy in scripting and editing but it's always there as a <UNK> to desperate efforts to find another lost child a kidnap victim before it's too late the story takes many twists and turns before the surprise ending and one is fascinated alike by the plot and characters although i found the many villains a little <UNK> the police and especially herself are not always competent nor that likeable which figures given the unpleasant job that they have to do in the sleazy underworld which this series <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> herself has said that she'll make no more movies in the series but excellent as she's always been in the role of the series itself is as actor proof as is another addiction of mine dick <UNK> american law order whoever appears <UNK> each could go on forever as is my <UNK> hope
<START> i know that <UNK> parker and matt stone really hate celebrities and spoof them in every single episode of south park if not showing them then mentioning them and they love to mock and joke and make fun of themselves too but i felt this <UNK> went too far br br for one thing the most common running theme in the documentary is that they're episodes are meaningless pieces of crap they put out just for the money obviously that's completely untrue if you even bother to watch any episode and the constant you know i learned something today 's said at the end of almost every episode by the main characters the creators are also depicted as pompous arrogant <UNK> who only care about money including a supposed to be funny but isn't scene involving <UNK> hayes delivering lines for chef over the phone and <UNK> parker yelling and screaming at him for sucking and hanging up i guess it's supposed to be funny but the <UNK> in it just really made it cringe br br the way they interview employees working for <UNK> and matt shows the duo as <UNK> who push their employees to the limit all just for money in the end completely untrue obviously and all a joke but it's just not funny it's disturbing even though it's just a joke
<START> this movie stars ben kingsley as frank a hit man for some russian <UNK> based out of buffalo he is also a raging alcoholic and this has caused his job performance to decline after he falls asleep in his car during a would be hit his mob boss uncle sends him to san francisco where he is to attend <UNK> <UNK> and get a job as a assistant if you're thinking that this makes absolutely no sense you're not alone br br it gets worse well it actually gets better but not before getting much much worse frank suddenly becomes a master <UNK> in spite of a complete lack of training but his reactions with the people in the funeral home and the <UNK> <UNK> are interesting the viewer starts to root for him as they notice positive changes in his life luke wilson is a welcome addition as <UNK> <UNK> although he is given almost nothing to do his character does tell us he is gay but this ends up having no significance whatsoever the movie <UNK> <UNK> into idiocy with the introduction of the tea <UNK> character she is completely unrealistic and her role as a love interest to frank <UNK> as the two actors have no chemistry together around the time she comes into the picture frank becomes much less engrossing as a character his characterization is seemingly random there is no <UNK> in his behavior the comedy is low key and only <UNK> funny especially disappointing considering the comedic <UNK> of the cast br br problems abound in this one <UNK> accent is terrible and inconsistent it <UNK> between italian russian and hispanic throughout the course of the movie frank tells numerous people he is a hit man including an entire <UNK> group but nobody seems to care or wants to do anything about it the movie relies on cliché scenes to carry it through its final act most notably when <UNK> character chases frank down at the airport just when he is about to board a flight back to buffalo br br though it has a strong premise and an interesting first half hour the movie quickly becomes a total disaster and <UNK> into complete nonsense at the end of the film frank <UNK> one year of <UNK> i hope to celebrate many many years of not having seen you kill me br br my grade d
<START> making a film based on a true story particularly one as incredible and horrifying as the 1972 plane crash is hard for even the best filmmakers but the <UNK> behind this forgettable and cheap exploitation flick don't even try the actual names of both the survivors and the <UNK> of the <UNK> air force plane crash have all been altered the crash itself is obviously staged in a very slip <UNK> manner and the <UNK> aspect has been unnecessarily and <UNK> played up shockingly it made a ton of money on both sides of the border thankfully thought it has mercifully been forgotten but the same people behind this would later give us the equally revolting <UNK> cult of the damned br br this cheap horror exploitation flick <UNK> the making of alive some fifteen years later that film was a masterpiece survive to put it mildly is not
<START> i picked up this movie and was horrified to find out that the movie is based on a rape of a little girl that the parents <UNK> take their daughter to my first thoughts were that i have never been more ashamed to be an indian as well as a <UNK> i found this movie to be down right appalling please don't waste your time as for the music there are at most 2 horrible songs and the film used is cheap the beautiful scenes are not what india is known for i just hope that i have shed some light on how disgusting this movie really is yes it may highlight how evil people in power especially when it comes to religion may be but to sit down and watch almost 2 hours of this movie can make almost anyone gag if your up for a good indian movie watch something by director mira <UNK>

<START> jack frost 2 was a horrible terrible sadly pathetic excuse for a <UNK> to a great movie the original was a low budget comedy horror film about a murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some toxic waste and the snowman went around murdering people and avoiding blow like the plague this however was a far cry from the quality of the original it seems like this even had a lower budget because for some reason after an hour into this film i still hadn't seen the snowman some revenge he's getting if he's always in the form of ice <UNK> with a cheesy voice over and a little shake of the <UNK> he rests in to give animation to the character disappointing to no belief even for a fan of bad cinema
<START> drug runner <UNK> <UNK> introduces his friend rock <UNK> to his boss drug <UNK> frank <UNK> unknown to <UNK> <UNK> is actually an undercover police officer during the bust on <UNK> factory <UNK> accidentally shoots <UNK> in the head he survives the wound later <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hired <UNK> the duo must overcome their mutual hatred to survive br br adam <UNK> films are usually a hit miss affair with his comedies either loved by his fans or hated by everyone this one is not as stupid as his other films but still cannot overcome a lazy script the direction is incredibly <UNK> with fast paced action sequences giving way to slow comic <UNK> between sandler damon wayans some of the action scenes  flying a plane with no <UNK> a car chase at night through a forest  are quite <UNK> contrived the acting is the standard for this genre with sandler wayans making a good pairing in short the film is dumb but fun to watch br br grade c review by m k <UNK>
<START> its a spoof its an intelligent comedy it has some a pathetic action and choreography and mind it it is intentional good <UNK> songs good performances by the entire cast brilliant by <UNK> salman and <UNK> and over all an script which is so rare in indian cinema that too in comedy watch david <UNK> etc story is of two <UNK> whose only aim is to get rich and famous by any which ways they come across one such way when they find out that a rich <UNK> is coming india to get married rest of the story is about and how these <UNK> try to out wit each other entire cast is perfectly cast right from <UNK> till <UNK> songs are rightly placed and are funny surprise package is salman who acts with perfect timing and this particular act gave him his style of comedy br br all an all a film which you should not ignore if you like and watch indian cinema
<START> spoiler it gives away the very irrelevant ending br br at the beginning of this movie there was a brief intro to the world of gore by the master of gore movies h g lewis he talked about how this movie was lost and then found years after the director's death he also talked about how gore movies were <UNK> by the amount of stage blood used in it blood feast was a 2 10 000 <UNK> was a 5 but then he goes and claims that dr gore was a 15 i want to know where half of the 15 <UNK> went watching the movie i saw very little near 15 <UNK> agreed there was a fairly large amount of blood but no where near 15 <UNK> some of the <UNK> scenes were definitely pretty gory and realistic strings of flesh and all but i wouldn't say 15 <UNK> br br end does that sound familiar that's what you should have been saying near the last half of this movie after the <UNK> character was tossed into the acid bath the movie <UNK> to a painful crawl there was no coherent end as it didn't fit into anything the 90 minutes before it provided she drove off in a van with a total stranger big deal that's what happens when you keep an individual i won't say person because she doesn't qualify as a person very innocent about the world around her the doctor teaches the girl that a man is to be loved so every man she meets she loves br br even though h g lewis told us at the beginning of the movie that we may not like the acting the directing or even the gore i will go with choices a and b both were terrible it was enough to give me bad dreams of cut editing and people with <UNK> eyes as they talk to one person but i made it through the movie and came out stronger too bad i couldn't say the same after finishing <UNK> c h i c br br this was a bad movie i can usually take my doses of <UNK> in good <UNK> but every once in a while you get a movie that bites back i think this movie took off an arm or a leg haha sigh admitted i did enjoy the stare down scenes where the good doctor <UNK> at his future victims and opened his eyes really wide and just <UNK> it was very similar to in blood feast when he <UNK> at that lady in his <UNK> shop and did not use his power after that i guess this movie picks up where powers left off br br final judgement the movie should have stayed lost good day br br scott
<START> i would give this movie high marks for the cinema photography and performances i just read a user comment concerning the performance of the actress who plays a conniving <UNK> who the lead character i remember a mini biography of this actress following the movie the last time i saw it apparently she was a holocaust <UNK> discovered by a french husband and wife in the movie industry who were taken with her extraordinary beauty she died very young and under tragic circumstances gene tierney is also outstanding in this film like other neo biblical films of the 1940's and 50s the egyptian reflects the morals and values of that time but is still great entertainment because the performances are terrific and the story so well told
<START> i am still trying to figure out what the target of this movie was 1 whether to show how stupid <UNK> <UNK> and arrogant the police is i surely could add various <UNK> here but i think my point on this is clear 2 whether to show how a twisted minded crook that does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos 3 whether to show if a <UNK> detective will solve a case just by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again till the criminal answers 4 or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called a <UNK> br br this was one of those movies that in a way did not disappoint me from the first 10 minutes i kind of figured out that this movie will not be nominated for the best movie award and surprisingly enough  this was consistent throughout the whole time it was stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how <UNK> it will continue and end  and i was not disappointed there either br br was it a complete <UNK> of time yes which raises your question  why did i watch it throughout well i was trying to fall asleep and i thought this was a great candidate for that but unfortunately i had too much coffee before <UNK>
<START> really this has to be one of the most stupidest attempts to get people in my age <UNK> attention it's about some <UNK> girl named and her friends that <UNK> <UNK> school boring all she ever does is <UNK> and complain and acts like a spoiled idiot i remember this show came out in 2005 i was 13 going on 14 and even then i thought it was pointless the only episode i ever liked was when the boys <UNK> a camera in the girls <UNK> that's it anyway i just don't understand why <UNK> oh my bad nick feels the need to <UNK> this sorry poor excuse for entertainment serious this decade is becoming a joke every year and it gets worst and worst what's with this generation br br anyway r i p <UNK> 1979 1998 2005
<START> this is a finely crafted movie with moving sequences humor and best of all a love story anthony quinn is wonderfully casted and after seeing several of his movies this has to be <UNK> as one of his best performances besides <UNK> the movie makes you really wonder if its filmed in romania which apparently is not the case it is sure to fool even native <UNK> with its authentic like landscape costume and ways of life according to imdb it is actually shot in france and <UNK> hmmm the story is compelling making you want to watch the entire movie over to see if you missed something it <UNK> me into <UNK> to find out if this is a truth based movie but to my disappointment it is a novel based film seemingly fiction it seems a bit far fetched to have happened for real but one never knows the one problem with this film is that it doesn't seem to cast any romanian actors and it is a film about a romanian character there are probably many romanian fill ins in the beginning but maybe not it is filmed elsewhere the author of the book was romanian at least thats all fine and dandy overall a masterpiece in cinematography
<START> yet another cookie cutter movie about a hardened adult who meets an adorable street smart kid cop and 1 2 gloria etc and once again it is not funny or interesting for anyone to watch kids or adults i'm sure some people might find this movie amusing but i have no <UNK> idea why once again i feel sorry for the poor kids who were forced to work in this movie so that everyone else and their parents could make some bucks at the price of a cheesy cheesy movie
<START> i acquired this film a couple of years ago and on trying to find some info about it i found that even the mighty imdb didn't have it listed that should have been all i needed to know br br with friends like these is an anthology that plays like a collection of second rate twilight zone outer limits episodes all linked together by a bus journey that never really seems to tie in with the rest of the film of the three stories the only one that i <UNK> any entertainment value from was the second episode in which a man of sorts grows out of the <UNK> in a guys <UNK> this episode wins points for a few spots of humour and it's bizarre premise other than that there is an episode with a talking car bland and <UNK> and an episode where a girl visits a very unique dating agency my dog guessed the ending of this one br br as has been mentioned in other comments the 18 rating is entirely <UNK> there is nothing to offend here if you're after a good horror anthology check out asylum or the <UNK> films instead
<START> now i did watch this when it first came out on vhs and all my friends and i thought it was a pretty good movie but then again we were teenagers but honestly not that good of a movie in retrospect sort of a hair metal version of carnival of souls but a bad movie does not exactly mean it is unwatchable however this one seems to lack the charm a lot of the regular mst3k fodder usually contains but if it was on cable and i was bored and drinking beer sure i'd watch it again but then again i've watched howling <UNK> about five times now so maybe you really shouldn't be listening to me br br anyone else think it kind of sad that the director supposedly commented on his own movie and why did he feel the urge to use <UNK> lock so much
<START> what's the point of this messages if not to discuss and share thoughts about the next season here is my <UNK> 1 the <UNK> was indeed blown but somehow everybody inside survived <UNK> lets see about that 2 the episode at the end with the <UNK> is an observation team <UNK> the tracking device <UNK> on boat by penny now that the <UNK> shield around the island was lifted the <UNK> was picked up by the observation station and they are going to send a rescue mission 3 after the destruction of the <UNK> the island is not isolated any more and other ships <UNK> are going to arrive 4 the others are finally going to share their secret with us poor <UNK> br br was it actually confirmed that there are going to be 4 seasons of lost br br cheers mike
<START> wow kiss the bride wasn't that bad but it wasn't that good either it sure was no later day saints the movie <UNK> in the center perhaps cutting out about 30 minutes would have made a more enjoyable film but the film gets <UNK> down again and again by annoying subplots and throw away scenes the whole gold outing sequence comes to mind br br even though kiss was made for theatrical release it looks and sounds more like a made for tv movie every scene is <UNK> like a department store so many characters are so throw away br br and dear <UNK> is actually a pleasant surprise she steals every scene she appears in br br one scene really annoyed me it was the rehearsal dinner in this larger room with scores of tables all <UNK> but only 5 or 6 people in a room for 250 where did everyone go br br gay cinema has sunk to a new low but not as low as the horrible films being produced and shown on the here channel
<START> beyond is one of the most emotional and intense films ever made superbly directed by john <UNK> and acted by patricia arquette this film can easily be called one of the best films of the 90's the story and vivid characters just grab the audience from the very opening and never lets go after seeing the film the viewer will never be able to forget beyond the film made little money at the box office and is little known but should be high profile watching it you can tell that it was meant to be seen by a large audience it is a very important and moving film and should be seen by everyone br br
<START> this was easily one of the <UNK> of the ernest movies especially in regards to the production design what was up with the pink guard uniforms sadly this film probably destroyed the ernest series turning the series into a straight to video series however jim <UNK> gave one of his better performances by playing <UNK> his criminal alter ego a <UNK> in the series but wasn't too bad in most regards the <UNK> man routine was classic
<START> jude law nicole kidman and <UNK> they are all horrible especially the star jude law br br it's directed by the same guy who did the english patient and its based on a best selling novel of a man <UNK> all to get back to his lover but unlike the wonderful english this movie sucks it is really bad br br worst dialogue ever but we've only know each other for a moment but they were a thousand moments like <UNK> in a bag br br or br br in some cultures you just have to say i marry you 3 times and you're married <UNK> <UNK> i marry you i marry you i marry you i marry you br br i'm ashamed i sat through it all br br the whole movie was awful horrible no words i'm sick br br 1 10 the one is for the really loud bullet sounds the sound crew did a good job
<START> almost no cinema experience can beat a good thriller with a sense of humor <UNK> davis is a <UNK> housewife who suffers from <UNK> even on the <UNK> but then an auto accident <UNK> the woman she used to be and it's hot samuel l jackson is hilarious as the low rent private eye who tries to help davis find her past only to find out he's in way over his head davis has some hilarious lines too and the interaction between her and jackson works surprisingly well br br look for brian cox the original <UNK> and david finally managing to shed his st elsewhere tv image the film is directed by <UNK> husband who almost seems to have built the whole film around her but it works br br i pull out this dvd and <UNK> it often i still love the makeup scene is <UNK> hot or what
<START> quentin <UNK> partner in crime roger co writer on pulp fiction <UNK> out on his own q t goes <UNK> <UNK> this time for this over boiled french thriller br br eric <UNK> is <UNK> safe cracker <UNK> who has <UNK> over to france from the u s at the request of an old friend there he teams up with a <UNK> crew of drugged out hippies who with little or no planning think they can knock off a bank vault full of gold <UNK> on a french national holiday br br has <UNK> the robbery gone wrong theme that tarantino developed so well in <UNK> dogs only killing <UNK> is not good enough to survive on the strength of this alone so has thrown in a rather beautiful distraction julie <UNK> is <UNK> a student come call girl who entertains <UNK> on his arrival in paris a stunning distraction she certainly is but nothing more br br i guess our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme but sadly the move did not help to add the depth his shallow plot so desperately needed there was never a story in this idea which was nothing more than that an idea even the surreal journey into the seedy <UNK> of paris is uninspiring i figure one would have to <UNK> that there was never much of a movie in the story of a bunch of gangsters shooting each other up over a <UNK> <UNK> heist either that is until you add intricate characters and snappy dialogue <UNK> dogs had it killing <UNK> did not br br <UNK> strong interpretation of the <UNK> <UNK> and jean hughes mad portrayal of the obsessive ring leader do nothing to lift proceedings in short has <UNK> attempted to <UNK> entertainment out of nothing br br friday september 15 1995 <UNK> theatre
<START> simon <UNK> remake of the 1979 horror classic is a pathetic attempt to bring old school thrills to a contemporary audience starring talented teen <UNK> belle when a calls fails to even <UNK> a shocked or even surprised face poor attempts at <UNK> the audience range from <UNK> <UNK> that look like people to building the tense music up for a cat running out of the shadows the plot follows jill johnson belle a teenage girl that has to pay off a bill to her father via <UNK> she is invited to work for the night at a house by the river and thinks it a perfectly easy way to make cash but little does she know a stranger <UNK> in the house and constantly <UNK> johnson via the phone a pathetic excuse for a film
<START> once again has provided us with a top quality film this director is amazing and he's <UNK> that he's equally talented and effective when crossing genres br br the excellent character development of the movie through dialogue and personality quirks but with more subtle details as well <UNK> father's <UNK> allows the audience to identify with the protagonists very closely making the importance and emotional impact of the events which take place all the more profound the visuals are at times simple at times stunning the dream to the beach and i think films really benefit from the fact that he also <UNK> the music it matched the film's varying <UNK> <UNK> br br more than just a film about <UNK> which in itself is an important issue this film <UNK> the <UNK> of a man who at times genuinely seems to enjoy life albeit in a quite limited way and yet one who is <UNK> in his desire to die the overwhelming sadness of the film is <UNK> by well timed <UNK> of humor which seem all the funnier because they provide a welcome <UNK> from the melancholy you will certainly feel br br although clearly in favor of <UNK> this film does an excellent job representing the <UNK> points of view of <UNK> friends and family most poignant was <UNK> father when he said <UNK> there's only one thing worse than losing a child that the child wants to die br br excellent writing acting directing cinematography music 10 10
<START> i've always found the <UNK> man ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious and i've never understood why his work <UNK> so much attention apart from his which he invented by accident and which are merely direct contact photo <UNK> his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn but surely this had to happen eventually and there's no real reason why ray deserves the credit the critical reaction to man ray reminds me of the story about the <UNK> new clothes br br de <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> features a lot of <UNK> photography and a recurring visual theme of a <UNK> which is never explained have the fascinating ability to <UNK> lost limbs and even to <UNK> entire <UNK> bodies but if that has anything to do with this movie's theme ray <UNK> to say so i was much more impressed by this movie's title cards which in french manage to include <UNK> a pun belle and some br br as so often in <UNK> work there is indeed a beautiful young woman seen in this movie unfortunately the photography is largely so <UNK> that we have little opportunity to appreciate her i'll rate this mess one point out of 10
<START> to <UNK> <UNK> i kind of like this movie it's the exact opposite of everything i hate in a film br br this obscure film was too low key and intelligent to get a theatrical release any chance for success would have needed a <UNK> <UNK> campaign and a coming of age story where nothing spectacular happens where instead the focus is on character development has a limited target audience whoever heard of a mature teen movie br br but if you have an opportunity to see this or if you can part with a few bucks for the dvd you could do a lot worse my <UNK> wife is nothing revolutionary but it has a lot going for it and holds up well to repeated viewings br br jason london as high school senior todd <UNK> is the star and fits this character as well as his parts in the man in the moon and <UNK> and confused he is helped out by exceptional work from his supporting cast <UNK> <UNK> in the title role is a revelation she can act as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and love interest christopher <UNK> as the teacher in a nice self <UNK> performance and <UNK> lee as <UNK> best friends and jeffrey as his father br br as someone commented earlier this is a mature teen movie because the romantic relationships are universally <UNK> at least by traditional happy ending standards even <UNK> parents are indifferent to each other with his father <UNK> after the title character and his mother leslie literally on the <UNK> during her entire time on screen a device that provides increasing comedy relief with each <UNK> appearance the london <UNK> romance has unexpected charm and is far more believable than any other older woman storyline you are likely to find br br but the real strength of the film is the <UNK> relationship of the three friends there is no overwrought melodrama here just three immature people who alternate between testing and <UNK> each other subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing they actually manage to pull off a believable three person relationship perhaps the first one in cinema history br br then again what do i know i'm only a child
<START> <UNK> starts in the south american rain forest where captain <UNK> casper van <UNK> his men are attacked by a bunch of vampires they barely manage to escape with their lives jump forward six months later <UNK> is called to see colonel weaver <UNK> carter who informs him there has been other reported <UNK> of vampires that his ex wife her dr laurie williams jennifer <UNK> has gone out there on an expedition to study <UNK> worried she <UNK> <UNK> to take a squad of soldiers back to south america officially provide back up to captain <UNK> kevin his men while at the same time <UNK> look for laurie not get killed by the vampires who have decided to venture out of the <UNK> into the <UNK> world br br edited written directed by kevin <UNK> this is yet another poorly made sci fi channel original which just isn't very good in any respect the <UNK> script has nothing going for it as far as i could see it's one of those modern vampire films which decides to pick choose the <UNK> vampire film <UNK> rules it wants to use like these vampires can be killed with stakes through the heart have <UNK> but at the same time can <UNK> walk around in <UNK> they don't sleep in <UNK> the film moves along at a reasonable pace but it's all very dull bland lifeless the story is poor just rather stupid the character's are terrible the dialogue is forgettable there's very little here to recommend <UNK> also tries to have some sort of <UNK> message as the head vampire claims they are only starting to kill human beings because of their <UNK> destruction of the rain forest where they have lived in secret for centuries unfortunately there's no conviction there is more like a throwaway line to fill the time than a serious statement there isn't enough exploitation content is a rather unsatisfying way to spend 90 minutes of your time the makers don't even do anything with the jungle setting hell i didn't expect predator 1987 but i hoped for a bit more than this br br director <UNK> has made several horror films all of which i have seen have been equally poor i'm sorry but he does nothing here turns in a <UNK> forgettable looking feeling film there's no atmosphere or tension as for genuine scares forget about it the gore is restrained there are some bitten <UNK> a bit of <UNK> blood but it's nothing we haven't seen before or has much impact there's also a huge vampire monster creature at the end but it doesn't look that impressive it gets itself killed far too easily br br with a supposed budget of about 2 000 000 this actually had a decent sized amount of money spent on it but it's still a rubbish film it's reasonably well made but nothing special or memorable the acting sucks i'm sorry but that's the way i saw it br br <UNK> is yet another poor stupid boring made for tv sci fi channel rubbish that i simply can't recommend not to be confused with the rather fine one time british <UNK> <UNK> gore film the <UNK> 1982 which is 100 times better than this so track that down watch that instead
<START> national <UNK> tells the story of <UNK> brown a young english girl with dreams of entering her beloved horse into competition at the <UNK> grand national horse race the film follows her as she trains her horse with the aid of a former <UNK> and the support of her parents br br while national <UNK> is a family film that fact shouldn't <UNK> anyone who typically views such films with <UNK> the film is indeed one that will appeal to the entire family not just attention <UNK> youngsters it even managed to land five oscar nominations hardly a sign of off for a general audience br br anne <UNK> in the part of mother actually won an oscar for her performance she was indeed excellent in the role but it is 12 year old elizabeth taylor who steals the show she is a charming presence and <UNK> a talent beyond her years also on board are oscar winner donald crisp as father mickey rooney as former <UNK> <UNK> taylor and angela lansbury in one of her earliest film roles as older sister br br the film's <UNK> technicolor makes for an attractive viewing experience while the editing <UNK> the second of the film's two oscars additionally the film was nominated for its direction by clarence brown cinematography art direction the score by ten time oscar <UNK> herbert <UNK> is also worth mentioning though it went br br all in all national <UNK> is a wonderful family film that deserves a higher rating i realize that the <UNK> of watching a film about a girl and her horse isn't exactly going to thrill some people but this one is worth taking a chance on
<START> it's really a shame to see so many talented people involved in what's happen to be a very waste of talents the plot is cliché the directing is too self conscious and the characters are almost caricatures one of the most disappointing aspect of this film is gerard <UNK> performance in the english version this movie was shot in french and english at the same time although he is one of the best actor in the film he gives the worst performance of them all i must say that <UNK> <UNK> come very close though br br on a more positive note i must say that the newcomer juliette gives an amazing performance in both version unfortunately that the only good thing i remember about this film br br by the way i must apologize for my not very good english
<START> i watched this film for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as before br br there are more than a dozen modern stunning french films from en <UNK> de to the three colours trilogy and all of them are special this film is one of them a true delight with so many great things going for it from the homage to hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in and monica while monica is very beautiful is a very sexy lady and steals many of the scenes she <UNK> br br i am not sure why people think this film is convoluted as the scenes are such a perfect blend of past and present acting as a <UNK> to the characters' own remarkable journey that the film simply flows and you barely realise that <UNK> minutes of beauty and mystery have left the viewed enchanted and <UNK> br br like most french and european films this story would never translate across the atlantic as no studio could capture the magic without the life out of it with the hollywood <UNK> common to most movies that become lost in translation americans make brilliant films but not of this type perhaps if they let someone like a young polanski work on it then maybe they would not totally butcher an english version br br for those who do not watch subtitled films you will spend a lifetime in ignorant bliss for those who can read then you would be yourself to miss films like this br br i would describe this as neo franco noir but only to cheese off the reviewer who called this film <UNK> i think i saw him doing an add for four and twenty <UNK> he thinks is a type of french it is arty in the way that pulp fiction is arty but with more <UNK> <UNK> br br 10 out of 10 with every viewing and has anyone got phone number she is the perfect french <UNK> dressing
<START> like a very expensive buffy episode <UNK> with plenty of humor lots of wire and stunt kung fu the twins effect goes on the list of classic must see hk films the vampires have a cool blend of <UNK> ghost type and the pretty boy european style if you get the opportunity to see this one in the theatre it is worth a 30 minute drive otherwise buy the <UNK> dvd before someone <UNK> it up by giving it a bad dub
<START> this film and i use that term loosely reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote at <UNK> months p u <UNK> br br like that joke this movie can only appeal to the very young the very immature or the very stupid br br that said there are a few bright spots br br the effects where the majority of the <UNK> 100 million went are <UNK> and convincing i mean as convincing as those kind of <UNK> cgi effects can be the cgi baby effects are not great but i imagine those are very hard to do well although for a hundred million bucks they could have been better br br <UNK> the dog from <UNK> <UNK> in his usual <UNK> performance steven wright did well with a small part alan <UNK> was well alan <UNK> as villain which we've seen before and bob <UNK> as <UNK> was <UNK> but enjoyable br br the actress playing mrs <UNK> was cute as a button as you'd expect and jamie kennedy <UNK> as you'd expect his best role so far was in the scream trilogy not to be confused with the lord of the rings trilogy and in three kings he should stick perhaps to more subtle forms of comedy jim carrey he ain't br br the writing and direction were if anything worse than <UNK> performance i semi remember one clever though seven year old clever line that i wish someone would quote accurately for the memorable quotes section something about <UNK> costume being the <UNK> crap in it was a second grade joke but sort of funny in context br br over all since there's nothing lower than a one i give this film a one
<START> i got this movie out a week after the death of <UNK> <UNK> i suppose if there is one way to mark the passing of a great director its to raise a glass of wine to him while watching one of his greatest movies <UNK> had one of the finest careers in japanese film but as he never had a distinctive style or theme he often seems to be overlooked compared to his near <UNK> such as <UNK> and kurosawa he was a little younger than them but not by much he is one of those directors who defies auteur theories its likely that his wife who wrote the screenplay for this and many other of his movies was as much responsible for the quality of the movies as he was but at his best he was as good as any japanese film maker at the time in particular he had great technical skills allowing him to tell complex stories in an accessible manner but in terms of theme this movie could hardly be simpler war is hell no really its seriously hell br br fire on the plain doesn't follow the normal war genre rules there is no real beginning we start as the wretched <UNK> who is a regular private although it is implied he is more thoughtful and educated than most of the others at one stage it is shown he understands english but he <UNK> up when the others ask him how he knows it is ordered to hospital as his unit is already in an appalling state the soldiers are defeated and starving to death they are no longer an army just a <UNK> bag group of <UNK> hunted by the locals and pretty much ignored by the americans who have bigger fish to <UNK> <UNK> and despair is driving the soldiers to the edge and beyond of madness br br in typical <UNK> style its not all just grim its oddly funny in parts a very black humour of course br br the high points of this movie to me are the outstanding performances from the leads and the vivid photography the characters in all their humanity but also their complete loss of humanity are all too believable this is that rare film one which will refuse to <UNK> itself from your head even if you want to forget it
<START> can't <UNK> like alec baldwin get it through their heads that they lost the <UNK> of 2000 and 2004 the ridiculous lame <UNK> at <UNK> non union workers george w bush and the stock market not to mention the intentional <UNK> accent that character uses in the film just makes him look silly and bitter on screen as the credits roll the sour <UNK> continue as special thanks are given to ken lay and other <UNK> from <UNK> and let me clue you in to something if you put all your money into one <UNK> stock you're an idiot we don't need this excuse for a movie to tell us that what a waste of jim <UNK> talent from the trailer i expected a completely different movie what i got was a 90 minute commercial on how to scare people into not <UNK> for their own future keep them stupid and keep them <UNK> on government no wonder hollywood is in trouble and can't make a decent movie anymore maybe you guys could get an original idea and put it on screen for once although i shouldn't be surprised since jane fonda was cast in the original
<START> anyone remember the first etc back when it was about making crazy cool stuff rather than watching <UNK> act like a <UNK> spoiled 5 year old super rock star wannabe br br the show used to be awesome however fame and wealth has led him to believe that we now enjoy him acting childish and idiotic more than actual cool stuff that used to be in ex br br the acts are so repetitive there's like nothing new except annoying stupidity and <UNK> comments the only things we see is <UNK> so busy showing us how much he doesn't care how much money he got or whatsoever br br i really got nothing much left to say except give us back cause <UNK> suck br br i enjoy watching steve o <UNK> etc a thousand times more
<START> best movie by far very funny very <UNK> if <UNK> made a movie starring buster keaton as <UNK> the clown it would look like this br br brilliant performances by the cast we already know from other schneider movies especially <UNK> as the sidekick of <UNK> who once more plays the wife in this one is a bit annoying though and of course <UNK> himself as <UNK> is absolutely incredible br br p s if this movie had a proper <UNK> i would really like to buy a <UNK> of that <UNK> painting
<START> me and a buddy rented this movie the other day at first look it seemed to be another teen movie which was also what we hoped for being fans of simple horror and comedy br br it seems that the movie is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible it quickly into something that holds a lot of potential unfortunately it never quite leaves the ground we had watched it for something that seemed like 1 hour when i finally half sleeping managed to say dude this movie sucks it was only 35 minutes actually dude agreed br br the problem is the movie is simply not funny it was undoubtedly supposed to be funny but it failed it failed in a way that made me sad it kind of reminds me of myself i had the potential to be anything i wanted and instead i ended up watching cheap horror funny movies all the time i pity the makers of this movie from the bottom of my heart its so sad all that potential and nothing
<START> i couldn't believe this was the same director as <UNK> line br br this film has it all a boring plot disjointed flashbacks a subplot that has nothing to do with the main plot what so ever and totally uninteresting characters it was painful to watch <UNK> painful
<START> you were on your way up and you <UNK> on a <UNK> <UNK> says to jim leonard that sums up the plot of this story of up and coming leonard a young <UNK> bogart when his dream gets <UNK> by the <UNK> <UNK> carol played by dorothy leonard has been working on a new and improved <UNK> but now his love life and <UNK> company both have their ups and downs in this <UNK> minute bogart hadn't developed the quiet brooding style yet good performances by most of the supporting characters her butler his co workers a sister <UNK> along the way some adult themes since it was done just before they really <UNK> the film code but it's still tame compared to what is on tv today directed by <UNK> a year before directed the incredible flying down to <UNK>
<START> i've spent a year <UNK> in iraq and amongst the hundreds of movies i've seen here was this little gem called vampire assassin judging from the cover african american with corn <UNK> with a <UNK> blade leather coat and the demeanor of a <UNK> i expected a blade rip off fair enough br br so i pop it in and observed a overweight african american with no blade no <UNK> and well nothing at all really except i don't know if you've read any of these other reviews you get the <UNK> of the flick it sucks bad really bad br br i don't know if it was the <UNK> esquire lightning after killing an immortal vampire or the karate kick sound effects for camera <UNK> or the twenty dollar budget on props or the ok we have 90 minutes to film this before we're caught filming in a johnson johnson parking lot or the martial arts that is as exciting and fast paced as two old people having sex or the <UNK> grade acting talent or the eccentric asian master who's either or on acid or what but the movie manages to force you to question your existence and that's awesome br br not many movies can be so bad that your head will explode like <UNK> if you <UNK> or mst3k with your friends this is the flick for you i've seen it three times already and i think it <UNK> caused permanent damage on my psyche if you still don't have any clue as to the quality of the film people were trying to give it away for free and no one would take it not even by force br br long story short watch it either as <UNK> pleasure or punishment it will rock your skull and for the most part for all the wrong reasons
<START> for anyone who liked the series this movie will be something to watch however it also leaves you wanting more i loved the way that every character detective made an appearance least with the ending of who is the fourth chair for they leave a reason for another movie my guess is <UNK> of course this like the series was a very well put together series of scenes this is a series i wish had lived on thanks to the cast for some wonderful tv
<START> eleven years ago stanley released his true inner self and became the hero of edge city by finding and wearing the <UNK> god of <UNK> mask the mask helped bring jim carrey to the <UNK> of comedy and reached a very popular status for its originality and just pure fun everyone knew how to spell party p a r t y why <UNK> i gotta now eleven years later it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new movie son of the mask someone asked director lawrence why are you making this and he responds <UNK> i gotta unfortunately that answer doesn't cover it because after seeing son of the mask i still left the theatre thinking good lord why and the rest of the people involved in the <UNK> film need to realize that the response given to why are you making this film should not be as simple as the answer to the debate on whether or not to party br br the son of the mask begins with <UNK> the dog finding the infamous mask and bringing it back to his owner tim <UNK> a clear homage to legendary loony <UNK> creator <UNK> <UNK> tim played by jamie kennedy is a struggling animator who is stuck working as a turtle tour guide for the animation company he <UNK> to one day draw for on the night of the company halloween party tim puts on the mask and transforms into the mischievous insane character that we all expect after the party tim goes home mask still on and <UNK> a child with his wife nine months later mayhem ensues as the baby born of the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers <UNK> the dog jealous of the <UNK> attention puts on the mask and <UNK> in tom and jerry type mayhem to out the baby meanwhile <UNK> played by alan <UNK> is in search for his mask at the orders of his father <UNK> br br first off ill admit that i do respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to the classic cartoons such as tom and jerry and loony <UNK> with its <UNK> e <UNK> type <UNK> and the infamous dancing frog type plot however this <UNK> cannot save the film and makes it less <UNK> and more of a waste of time br br the premise of the movie becomes increasingly silly silly is not always a bad thing but in this movie the silliness gets to the point of just plain annoying the characters are not fun to watch and what's worse they're not funny the <UNK> of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much cgi was used one of the greatest things about the original is that while obviously computer animation was used so much relied on jim carrey and his <UNK> style of just being jim carrey we were convinced was an actual cartoon jamie kennedy just doesn't have that kind of ability a fact that is clear when you watch him wear the mask and his facial features rarely shift the baby and dog were mostly completely animated which became increasingly distracting throughout the movie the side story of <UNK> searching for the mask just became more and more <UNK> br br the son of the mask is a sad sad state of affairs what i suggest is you go rent or buy the original the mask and thank the <UNK> gods or whoever for bringing it to us and will consider seeing the sequel my sacrifice as i continue to ask the infamous question why the son of the mask gets one star although that star should be <UNK> up between the classic creators of loony <UNK> and jim carrey who will always be in my book the mask
<START> loved this movie great acting by carla interesting story about a kidnapping that goes horribly wrong don't they all some surprising twists and turns in the film and the plot was easy to follow without being so convoluted as to be totally incomprehensible it was a totally unexpected delight more quentin ish than most films try to be
<START> the plot is simple an american couple is in vacation in thailand somehow they are attacked by the chinese vampires and the girl is kidnapped by the big boss of the vampires this is ok till now the girl's partner is left to search for her and now the horror begins he comes upon a strange group of semi vampires or something they only <UNK> animal blood these vampires are in conflict with the bad guy for about <UNK> years however with the help of the <UNK> <UNK> the guy begins to search his girlfriend br br now the fight scenes begin what a karate movie without fight another thing i have noticed is that the vampires are very ugly guys i mean a vampire is an old fashion guy he is alive since for ever he's got style there are also modern vampires but in this movie the vampires are weird like come on they ride a bike they are all dressed in leather and they destroy everything in their way br br the worst thing is that you can clearly see that this movie it is an low budget one the script is boring and the actors aren't too talented the music is pretty good but the effects are not that great br br to sum up the movie it is not that great but if you have a free afternoon watch it and tell me if i'm right or not
<START> i have long tried to understand why people like shakespeare so much and every few years i give him another go i was hoping that this play film my <UNK> different shakespeare play would <UNK> the lucky <UNK> and marry me to the <UNK> of this literary <UNK> <UNK> i clearly chose the wrong key br br once the phrase pound of flesh had been <UNK> 10 minutes into the film the main parts of the plot were transparent which <UNK> along with a <UNK> script and lifeless acting at every step the plot is laid bare two scenes in advance the concept that a dying aristocrat would <UNK> his daughter to choose her future husband by means of a <UNK> is <UNK> it is no surprise who wins the <UNK> <UNK> because a main protagonist in the play and he's the third man to try and there are three <UNK> to choose from and his friend risks his life to pay the <UNK> the only genuine surprise that i had watching this film is that it did not end immediately after the resolution of the court case however as soon as the ring <UNK> began it was immediately apparent what would <UNK> br br ok so i know that millions of you love shakespeare not for the surprise in the well known stories but for the depth and passion of the characters but i felt nothing for the characters rather than <UNK> with suspense and admiration during the court scene i sat there hoping that it would be over soon please br br one day i might just find a shakespeare play that does something other than bore me
<START> i'm very interested in the <UNK> positive reviews here while it had some good features for the most part i found this movie to be heavy handed predictable and worst of all not in the least bit scary the first 30 minutes of the movie were promising the actress did a nice job in her portrayal and the world around her was well thought out and meaningful unfortunately from there the movie entered into a <UNK> spiral i went into this movie with no clue as to what it would be about didn't know anything about the actors directors genre etc at a certain point my wife made the comment is this supposed to be a scary movie well i suppose so as the <UNK> plate horror movie score full of <UNK> <UNK> and extended <UNK> could mean nothing else there didn't seem to be a whole lot of originality in the movie the romantic interest was painfully obvious from the first moment and the second half of the movie <UNK> deep into the realm of the ridiculous a movie like this walks a dangerously narrow path and unfortunately there comes a point where the viewer must decide whether to continue walking along that path or to jump off and simply laugh at the <UNK> of it all for the final 30 minutes i chose the latter
<START> one of the most successful shows in television history is back now i admit i never got into the original show okay so i never watched it at all but the new show is impressive br br sci fi has premiered the first two episodes rose and the end of the world this weekend we meet rose a twenty something clerk who is chased by remote controlled <UNK> she is rescued by a mysterious stranger who calls himself the doctor using the internet she finds a conspiracy buff who warns her that wherever the doctor goes death follows when her geeky boyfriend mickey is replaced by an <UNK> the doctor informs her of a plot to use earth as a <UNK> ground for more of these plastic monsters whom the doctor has been fighting across space and time traveling in a <UNK> disguised a 50s style police call box br br she helps him save the world there wouldn't be a show otherwise and decides to join him but when he puts her life in danger he is <UNK> and questions whether her company was worth the risk br br although the special effects are kinda lame and the some of the scenes are a bit choppy doctor who is after two episodes aired in the us a smart well written work apparently the second season has already aired in the uk so i predict the same success here
<START> dirty dancing one of my most favorite movies i've only watched it two times on abc because i haven't had the chance to buy it or rent it from blockbuster i had no idea jennifer grey was 27 at the time she made the movie because she was very convincing as a teenager compared to some women in hollywood she has a very flat chest which is why i was fooled so easily about her age so both physically and emotionally grey pulls off playing a teen very well i also loved the dancing who wouldn't both times i've watched dirty dancing i keep wanting to look up dance classes i also love the soundtrack and i do recognize some of the songs from when i was eight or nine i would love to be able to watch this in my drama class and i'm going to ask my teacher at some point if there's any part of the movie he can use for educational purposes it's much better than the stuff he made us watch last year and the ending was absolutely fantastic that's one of the best moments in the film br br i can't believe i'm looking forward to the first day back to school because of dirty dancing who could ask for a better influence from a movie with that sort of title
<START> created in <UNK> and originally named <UNK> before walt disney changed his name because his wife convinced him mickey mouse has become the <UNK> of the disney brand i always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature mickey it is in fact his third but it doesn't matter for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable the story sees mickey <UNK> a <UNK> until captain pete takes him off the bridge stopping to pick up <UNK> and <UNK> mouse missing the boat being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them mickey helps her <UNK> it's tail and play the tune and getting some other animals to be <UNK> until pete comes along again to stop him making mickey <UNK> <UNK> mickey mouse was number <UNK> on the 100 greatest pop culture icons and he was number <UNK> on the 100 greatest cartoons very good
<START> it's amazing that such a cliche ridden <UNK> angst film actually got made in the first place the characters are so weak and the acting so uninspired that it's impossible to care about any of them especially brooke <UNK> the temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible if you like this genre you'd be better off renting <UNK> or bodies rest motion
<START> br br when i first heard about this back in 1997 over coffee with friends i decided to check it out the only problem was that it was on a small screen at one of my local <UNK> br br that didn't stop the enjoyment of seeing a simply great movie with a top notch cast in <UNK> quinn donald sutherland and ben kingsley the whole movie kept me glued to my seat br br i simply found no flaws in this great movie i give it my highest recommendation to those who love thrillers i am very proud to have this in my collection br br 10 10 i don't hand this out lightly
<START> if you like to get a couple of fleeting glimpses of <UNK> on some attractive women there may be a second or two of enjoyment from this film if you enjoy seeing poorly conceived and executed action scenes there are plenty if you are both blind and deaf i still advise you to not have this film on in your presence it is surely the worst or very close to the worst film i have ever seen and it does appear that there was some money spent on it talk about throwing money away as an editor i would hope that the editor s of this movie never again be allowed to edit a film book or even a post it note as a writer i would hope that the author s never again be allowed near even a broken <UNK> you would think that i am not <UNK> that you view this movie not so tape it so you may stop your pain when you need to and <UNK> yourself as to how bad a movie can be
<START> in <UNK> <UNK> two when it was announced that the was going to be made there was a storm of controversy this was an event which still left open wounds in the hearts and minds of the australian people after some changes listen out for the well timed <UNK> <UNK> to disguise names the <UNK> went to air it was nothing short of brilliant the leads were perfect max <UNK> as <UNK> lead the way closely followed by john <UNK> as malcolm <UNK> and the <UNK> john as sir john kerr the time was created well the feelings of the people were well done and the political elements were not two <UNK> made into melodrama as in so many american series the <UNK> was a faithful re creation of a time in australia which some would rather forget and which we cannot forget it did not take sides and it pointed out the mistakes and lies of both sides it leaves one wanting to maintain the rage and change the <UNK> which still allows for this to all happen again the <UNK> is now available on dvd in australia watch it learn from it and learn about our modern history
<START> the problem with this series is that it is too real i am watching it on amazon and having just finished episode 2 i hate absolutely hate the leader of the cell i cannot recall any television series ever having this emotional impact remember the old tag line for horror movies just keep telling yourself its only a movie well i find myself repeatedly reminding myself that its only tv but of course it isn't only tv is it the possibility of a cell such as the one portrayed here actually operating in the united states is certainly within the range of <UNK> that's what gives this program its vicious authenticity and that's why i hate it so much
<START> i swear i had never seen such a bad movie as half <UNK> is not only because it just makes no sense is a huge piece of and self confidence that makes me <UNK> br br sebastian in spanish has a similar <UNK> to which means out of life and happiness makes here a one man army movie thinking he is sam <UNK> or the boys who directed the blair witch project this is the blair project with an expensive low budget br br the story a couple of american filmmakers that go to africa to make a documentary of the half <UNK> is just no sense the way of filming <UNK> high speed shots with slow motion shots just your stomach more than the stupid lines what the hell is that dialog about <UNK> or the lame performances by the way i don't believe this cast or <UNK> is american they all look european to me br br to finish this just say that the filmmakers made an intelligent move about selling the movie they put a fake award achievement as most original film and a nice cover in spain the cover had the half <UNK> image in negative so i feel now unhappy because i can't demand my 14 <UNK> back
<START> yes bad acting isn't only one thing to mention bad script not so bad music unfortunately br br nice girl and nice boy with perfect bodies and super teeth just isn't enough for me and for you too br br first thing in the morning after crash they go to swim to the sea to have some fun smiling br br they find everything in the sea i mean things like fishing net knife <UNK> dive things <UNK> <UNK> husband br br stuff are you kidding stupid they are so happy on the island they are going to die and they are happy love peace love just stupid br br terrible skip this one please
<START> closet land the title itself <UNK> up thoughts of secrets and that is really what's at the heart of this <UNK> international film government secrets personal secrets both are integral pieces of this story br br by far the greatest acting seen in too long a time both alan <UNK> and madeleine <UNK> were phenomenal in their portrayal of a government <UNK> and victim respectively with only the two actors in this unusual standard length film it is instantly clear that both actors were dedicated and talented enough to pull the viewer into this tiny bubble of a world and shut the door br br a word of caution br br what isn't mentioned on the description of this movie is that there is a subplot that deals with childhood sexual abuse while there is no graphic detail about the abuse the nature of it may be difficult for some viewers to watch especially given the intensity of the film on whole br br i'm not a big fan of <UNK> international films but this movie drew me in because the acting was so exceptional and i can't help but make this movie one of my personal favorites
<START> i lived in that area <UNK> and jersey city for about ten years this film certainly captures the feel of that time and place the dialogue is very good the music is right and scenarios realistic as another poster said it looks almost like a documentary br br i like the way it <UNK> these kids who probably would have rather have been born in <UNK> but fall into what kids fall into it just so happens that area is pretty rough br br they over the cops quite a bit but that's to be expected i'd say the acting is good all around too br br it gives the viewer some sense of how this idiocy is caused and gets blown out of <UNK> hopefully the new mayor of <UNK> is making progress
<START> warning some possible plot spoilers as if that was possible br br okay if you haven't figured out the plot yet i am going to give it to you two couples head out to a camping site but a clown masked killer shows up and causes all sorts of mayhem br br now it is time for me to give these couples some advice br br 1 never ever go to camp dubbed camp blood by the locals 2 don't have sex or make out in front of the killer 3 don't go chasing after the killer if he or she runs away 4 don't yell profanity at the killer 5 make sure your <UNK> phone works before you go camping 6 everybody needs to bring a sharp or dangerous weapon and carry it on themselves at all times 7 wear loose and comfortable clothing and bring a good pair of running shoes no tight and <UNK> clothing and no high heels or <UNK> 8 wear glasses or contact <UNK> if you need them so you don't stab the wrong person 9 always carry your car keys on you 10 put out a camp fire when you go to bed 11 watch your step if you trip on something your going to break a bone 12 check the <UNK> for <UNK> guess 13 if the killer has you <UNK> at least put up a struggle br br and guess what at least one but usually all four of the main characters breaks all of these common sense rules they are the dumbest characters ever to grace a film br br now for some brief comments this slasher film was on a very tight budget so low four of the 7 or 8 actors play more than one role the acting writing direction sound lighting camera work plotting editing etc are all bottom of the line but like the classic film jack o this works on a <UNK> bad it is very entertaining and campy fun level so rent this and have a good time and laugh my rating 5 out of 10
<START> ok please believe me when i say that this is a terrible terrible sci fi movie its done so poorly that much of the film plays out as unintentional <UNK> and its absolutely a 100 waste of time awful but somehow also deeply unfunny i watched this as a double feature with <UNK> <UNK> the massacre and although was an incredibly superior film that's not saying much the plot of is so completely convoluted that its impossible to follow the narration is <UNK> often nonsensical seemingly endless and thoroughly <UNK> literally half the film is scenes of the female lead who looks like brian <UNK> walking through the desert the movie actually starts out pretty cool but then into and somehow continues to <UNK> minute by minute absolutely horrible and truly an <UNK> <UNK> test zero stars reviews by <UNK> <UNK>
<START> first let me say that those of you that voted it 10 are only kidding yourselves and trying to get the votes to a respectable level something that this movie doesn't deserve the only movies deserving a 10 imo are the classics godfather <UNK> etc look at the top rated films of all time for the complete list i also noticed that many people gave this a positive vote for being so realistic as far as what it's like inside a cave though i would have to agree with them on the surroundings they simply aren't rating the movie as a whole they are <UNK> by the surroundings but miss the overall review that would be like me voting a 10 for the movie from justin to kelly because i think that the beach scenes remind me of what it's like in the florida keys though that may be true it does not merit the film getting a 10 because the movie as a whole was <UNK> br br i wish i could tell you that something saved this movie as usually if one thing stinks in a horror flick something else picks up or makes up for the weakness ex bad actors are overshadowed by a great plot and or great camera work and scenery we started the dvd and it all started out fairly normal we <UNK> started to pick out who would be the first to die after a brief bit of driving and <UNK> they set up camp for the night at that moment i <UNK> in on some things which really made me tune out the rest of the film two main problems i had bad effects and an even worse story line the first thing that we all noticed was that the <UNK> weren't real you can <UNK> see the cgi or fake flames that they were all sitting at for a horror film to have such a blatant effect flaw should have told me what i was in for the next hour br br only minutes later i was shown how poorly written this film was i don't remember exactly how they arrived at the point but basically we find out that the token nerd is writing a book about exploring <UNK> etc another guy in the group wants to tell a story about an experience but <UNK> stating i don't want this story in your book the author convinces and <UNK> the other that he will not put the story in his book and that he can trust him a direct quote if i tell you the story you will definitely want it in your book at this point i was fully expecting a nice 5 minute story complete with flashbacks and heartfelt acting what i got was a short poorly told and acted statement i say statement because what he ended up telling was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences i don't remember the exact quotes but basically he says we were in a cave the cave <UNK> a girl died as our friend watched her <UNK> you may think i am over <UNK> and being really critical but that isn't far off from a direct quote line for line from the movie scene br br over the next 50 minutes or so the film takes place in the cave and though the lighting is what i would imagine to be like in a cave i could have really done without the really fuzzy <UNK> look to the film and the camera shaking is just one that i didn't go for i have really good vision and after watching the main parts of the film i felt like i was <UNK> blind i was emotionally detached from this movie therefore the parts that probably should have been scary weren't maybe had i been able to overlook the very slow and poorly acted start to this film i would have at least been scared but i don't remember anyone in the dark room even <UNK> at any of the action scenes br br the last scene was probably one i will never forget and that isn't a good thing basically two women are trapped in a room naked the monster comes in to attack kill the women he is stopped when he sees a picture of a little boy a flashback occurs where we find out that the monster was injured as a little boy and spent his entire life in the cave cut back to present time and he takes his mask a large <UNK> with what appears to be a shirt he <UNK> at the picture and the two women appear to have found the weakness soft spot at that point he stabs and kills one girl then proceeds to rape the other woman rather <UNK> after about 30 seconds of watching the camera <UNK> and shake as he rapes her roll the credits movie's over br br honestly if i had to do it all over and i wasted money on renting this movie i could have saved myself an hour and watch the first scene and last scene of this film and still left with the same thoughts about it that i have now br br those of you comparing this to blair witch are way off if any of you had read up on how the director and writer ran the filming of blair would realize how revolutionary it was <UNK> each cast member a script the day night of filming without the other cast members knowing what the other actor was doing is genius br br if imdb would let me it would get a negative score i don't understand how anyone in their right mind can recommend this movie
<START> i'd love to see some tie in between the fury and the x men series sort of the way the second outer series would tie in particular stories and plot lines after the fact to create a story arc although one was never intended i'd also like know if some more information <UNK> or otherwise exists anywhere about the relationship and or collaboration between clive barker and david <UNK> i simply can't get my mind around the fact that david <UNK> appeared as a mere actor in a clive barker film does any additional information on the subject actually exist finally it's been 17 years since the film was released and i had hoped there would've been a sequel by now does anyone out there know if there were any plans in the making that never came to <UNK> or if in fact there are plans even now for a sequel
<START> every boy eventually learns the lesson that just because a girl is good looking it doesn't mean she's good well <UNK> tell you at age 19 lesson learned it's hard to tell what's worse kathy <UNK> acting skills or her ultra high pitched voice the one that sounds like a <UNK> mouse on <UNK> scratching its tiny little <UNK> down a <UNK> with an incomprehensible plot set in outer space with <UNK> that want kathy <UNK> bones for some obscure reason this movie is just wrong on so many levels if there were ever a candidate for a mystery science theater 3000 revival this would be it
<START> being a fan of bela lugosi boris karloff and <UNK> <UNK> jr i had to see this what tripe the only thing good about this is the clips of lugosi karloff and <UNK> jr along with all the vintage clips that do not <UNK> with the new black and white footage not even close to steve <UNK> dead men don't wear <UNK> that was done great with all the technology we have now why <UNK> this done better if you are planning to shell out 5 bucks and some change be warned this is really bad but if you like lugosi karloff and <UNK> jr then watch their movies instead even ed wood did better then this one new actor mark <UNK> is pretty good as an imitation bela lugosi the clips they use are the ape mr wong most dangerous game lost world <UNK> man and devil bat that notorious bela lugosi classic i believe this production was very low budget and it shows 1 out of 10
<START> i really enjoyed watching this movie only a few parts were slow but it was only setting the mood and building up to the action i thought this movie was very educational it taught me more about my <UNK> <UNK> i also learned more about louise and i can say she has a very great influence on me time magazine named louise one of the world's 100 most influential people in april of 2004 i recommend this movie to people that like historical movies obviously this movie was very dramatic but still told the truth of events in the former <UNK> louise is a brave hero and i'm glad they made a movie <UNK> her if you see the movie i hope you'll like it
<START> the only reason i bought this dvd is because <UNK> <UNK> is in it now everybody knows she is the queen of martial arts b movies the trouble is this is not a martial arts movie <UNK> <UNK> has about a minute or so of fight scenes in this stupid movie now if you were a film maker and you had <UNK> <UNK> in your movie <UNK> you want to have a lot of martial arts action all she does in this movie is walk around looking bored just like i was when i watched this pile of crap i own a lot of her movies and they are all b movies but at least they had some cool fight scenes in them if you are a martial arts fan avoid this no matter what i'm still mad i wasted 4 dollars to buy this dvd
<START> the art of the absurd is alive and <UNK> in current danish cinema well at least it is in this movie nobody in this movie are amused they are all either annoyed or shocked and if they aren't yet they soon will be it is a story of screw ups murder embarrassment dignity and in the end love and redemption the chilling awkward humorous style is <UNK> and won't appeal to everyone but personally i found it to have just the right fascinating mix of the bizarre and the absurd you pity the characters from a distance even as you dislike them up close and personal but their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive them and be happy for them even when they get away with murder br br this is in my judgment definitely the best danish movie of the last few years br br 9 out of 10
<START> like the beauty of the jungle jessica <UNK> gorgeous smile and <UNK> looks <UNK> over the film but alas they are the only two things worth watching this film for when in theory we should be watching for the narrative br br the plot is thin on the ground and hard to believe as beautiful as jessica alba is she doesn't add any of the spark that she <UNK> into the credible <UNK> <UNK> series since dark angel it seems that alba has been reduced to mere eye candy but what eye candy and is the sole reason for putting her into films br br the concept of the sleeping <UNK> is <UNK> and implausible with little character development or character for that matter to make us want to <UNK> the <UNK> minutes run time with this world despite the films short running time it still manages to feel to long and too <UNK> br br it seems a shame that such talent such as brenda <UNK> emily <UNK> bob <UNK> are wasted on a <UNK> narrative which barely raises a pulse this film seriously misses a trick an exotic setting a more than capable cast with lovely cinematography and a chance to <UNK> the themes and the concepts of but there is little narrative to speak of no drama no sense we are watching a story of love more a story of lust and woman happy to please men without question lets be honest if jessica alba was <UNK> allowing you to sleep with her do you seriously think you'd be able to concentrate on learning a <UNK> language <UNK> lies the great problem both in suspension of disbelief and also what the female characters are limited and reduced to take for example the fact that jessica <UNK> character <UNK> the mental and physical <UNK> of <UNK> and birth to her forbidden love yet all we see is her looking lovely and <UNK> one minute then lovely and <UNK> with a baby the next br br it's a sorry state of affairs to see a film with promise not live up to anything near it's potential i could write endlessly of the films flaws but it pains me to do so the film looks good the premise could have been made into a lovely film but sadly it wasn't to be
<START> this is a remake of the anime classic from the 80's and this one is even better <UNK> and are all back as the knight <UNK> in their hard suits battling the robotic <UNK> the animation is crisp the characters are well developed and the action rocks is a singer in her regular job so the series features some wonderful songs as well there is a fair amount of violence but most of it is against robots and there is some fan service but nothing too <UNK> the dvds also have many extras including <UNK> which really enhance your understanding and enjoyment of the show a must have for any anime fan br br also recommended burst angel <UNK> iii
<START> i was just lucky i found this movie i've been taking advantage of <UNK> 5 50 dvds because i watch a lot of movies and very seldom watch television i <UNK> from high school in 1968 so i have family and many friends who served in vietnam this movie really illustrates the pain i've seen in my friends in dealing with what happened to them over there i wish more people would see this movie i think maybe more people could understand what happened to our vietnam vets by watching these excellent actors in the portrayal of one family damaged by that war the story felt realistic it isn't <UNK> but made me feel what they were going through i think it helped that martin sheen and <UNK> <UNK> were playing father and son it made their relationship more believable
<START> from a military standpoint nearly everything in this movie is historically accurate beyond that it is an enthralling story that leaves you depressed at the end but quite glad you took the time to watch
<START> and i do not understand why the show gets so much beating in my opinion this show really is excellent well the first two episodes were not that great but it picks up a load of momentum at the third episode which seems to be typical for a steve <UNK> sitcom i would rate it among the best sitcoms britain has ever produced br br the show itself is a farce at its best it is not along the lines of <UNK> towers but you definitely can rank it as high as a black <UNK> <UNK> or the young ones i am watching the first season and all i can say is that i am happy i bought the dvd br br the problem probably with this show is and why it got <UNK> so hard according to the internet that the original press release compared it to <UNK> towers and everyone was disappointed it was not well even green wing is closer to <UNK> towers than this show all i can say is clear your mind from every prejudice give the show at least a run until including episode 3 and then decide for yourself br br all i can say is thanks steve <UNK> for writing it and thanks for the entire staff pulling it off
<START> where should i begin with this movie all i know is that it is a mess be the script story or the actors first of all this movie is very disappointing from salman khan who gave us a fun hum le <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> jo <UNK> <UNK> before this second <UNK> is getting really annoying appearing in every stupid movie since <UNK> <UNK> glad <UNK> stopped this nonsense the story is stolen from the wedding singer but ruins the funny movie the dialogues are lacking i may have laughed here and there but entertained no salman khan was tolerable in the above mentioned movies but here he is insane his character is poorly written one minute he is poor and next minute you wonder how is he poor <UNK> <UNK> looks like a plain <UNK> and wasn't putting any effort she luckily redeemed her career with <UNK> because her career was going <UNK> around this time <UNK> put a little charm here with her looks but it is still not enough jackie is wasted <UNK> beauty and acting has ran away from her because she chose such a horrible script <UNK> <UNK> looks beautiful but puts little performance <UNK> <UNK> gets the award for worst supporting actor they need <UNK> because there have been terrible movies in india he says stupid dialogues dances terribly looks weird and is not in his regular form just to tell you there is more to the cast who are also terrible if it weren't for awesome beauty in <UNK> <UNK> life <UNK> de i wouldn't give the movie a point otherwise the dancing by salman was terrible <UNK> was dancing like a wind in otherwise i wish the costumes were given a make over and the rest of the cast and their monkey dancing had been blown away from the wind the good song of the album was o <UNK> o <UNK> which doesn't have a good enough <UNK> same goes for the half way decent title song otherwise this movie and the rest of the songs are a no no for everyone
<START> edge of madness is a tale about a woman in the <UNK> who gets hand picked by dirty <UNK> who can't keep his penis in his pants he just so happens to have a younger brother who is against rape and kills him but continuously says it was an accident this makes his wife go crazy she gets <UNK> and she takes the fall because she loves george too much br br like i said this type of thing has been done before this is just more artistic because it's canadian and it's an indie production done on a low budget with hardly known actors except that one kid from <UNK> <UNK> he's in it i whether this was going for oscar bait but it was sure as hell boring and this is based on a 40 page short story half of that short story is <UNK> into this flick and i'm glad otherwise i'd bore to death unfortunately i had to watch it in my media <UNK> class and i had an assignment on it read the short story and compare and contrast the flick to the story boring br br you know it's harder to answer movie questions when you don't like the movie ah well i hope this is the last type of assignment me and my class get for what it's worth annie was totally hot she had a nice soft ass and i liked the nude parts of her in the movie br br 3 10 for boring oscar bait performance and graphic sexuality plus nudity
<START> don't worry when looking at the cover of the dvd sandra <UNK> only appears at most 5 minutes in total in this cult classic the entertainment value here is very high br br to name but a few of the many highlights that should be paid attention to br br the <UNK> evil voices of the chief bad guys the special gun <UNK> the weird masks and outfits of the hit killers the <UNK> ways to catch a bullet and hit the ground the abundance of bottom up shots the spacey scene in which <UNK> falls unconscious on the street the over cliché italian mob guy moe the cheap <UNK> background music the mesmerizing overdone gun <UNK> br br and last but not least the super corny fist fight scenes wish there would have been more of those br br extra point for the successful attempt at making me laugh out loud
<START> continuing his comeback john travolta played a mildly twisted angel in michael he may be a <UNK> of god but he's not the <UNK> guy as <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and william hurt discover when i first saw this movie it was before i had started watching all in the family so i didn't recognize jean <UNK> as edith <UNK> now that i recognize her like that i try to imagine <UNK> <UNK> at her for <UNK> an angel whom he would probably rank alongside blacks jews etc br br i know that doesn't really relate to the movie but i just like to associate things that way anyway it's a pretty interesting movie also starring bob <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and richard <UNK> br br what john and paul said
<START> a poorly paced sf horror venture that takes itself much too seriously memorable only for a the beautiful <UNK> may wandering around naked through the chaos and b terrible <UNK> it has a few mildly gruesome effects and startling moments and some unintentionally funny scenes but is mostly a waste of time
<START> saw this movie at a saturday <UNK> with a friend theater was about 70 full br br although there are quite a few funny lines it is more of a drama suspense with humor <UNK> on top robin williams gives a decent performance as does laura <UNK> being a daily show fan lewis black is pretty good in this christopher walken gives a good performance also br br the movie starts out slow and remains that way for about the first thirty minutes then the suspense part kicks in and starts keeping you a little on edge throughout the rest of the movie suspense in a supposed comedy movie i know that i as well as everybody else in the place was struggling a bit with this a character would crack a joke during suspense sequence and you would hear just one or two laughs in the theater br br in all fairness after the movie was over there was <UNK> of applause so definitely some people enjoyed this movie br br i gave this movie a four out of ten because i believe the comedy aspect doesn't work very well in a suspense drama movie and the actors performances while not bad were just decent br br again this movie isn't what was advertised
<START> i had heard good things about states of grace and came in with an open mind i thought that god's army was okay and i thought that maybe had improved and <UNK> as a filmmaker the film began with some shaky acting and i thought well maybe it will get better unfortunately it never did the picture starts out by introducing two <UNK> mormon <UNK> and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them instead the story <UNK> into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events <UNK> blatant <UNK> by the <UNK> something that undeniably exists but rarely on the level that portrays and it becomes almost laughable br br only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience by <UNK> and <UNK> portraying the lives of mormon <UNK> <UNK> nothing more than <UNK> his <UNK> mormon audience the film in no way reflects reality missions are nothing like what shows having served a mormon mission myself i can <UNK> to this fact and gang life in california certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild <UNK> br br the conclusion which i'm assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all was both unbelievable c'mon the entire mission <UNK> to see this elder sent home and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other and cheesy next time try making a movie that someone can identify with
<START> be warned by the line on the back of the box that <UNK> a story involving over <UNK> <UNK> there isn't a thing redeeming about carrie 2 the plot is absurd the acting terrible and the ending all too predictable br br i wasn't expecting a masterpiece but i was expecting to be entertained i wasn't the only way i could <UNK> watching this movie was because i was at a <UNK> house while waiting for my car to be fixed unless in the same <UNK> stay well away from this film
<START> i'm normally a fan of mel gibson but in this case he did a movie with a poor script the acting for the most part really wasn't that bad but the story was just pointless with flaws and boring i thought i would like the movie a little but i didn't like it at all actually i give it a 1 1 2 out of 5
<START> well i have not much to say about this film except that it was a truly wonderful film natalie portman is absolutely fantastic as the daughter in this lovely mother daughter relationship film br br beautiful film
<START> the most irritating thing about dies august days is not simply that nothing happens in this film but that director marc has the nerve to pretend that this film is some sort of homage to <UNK> <UNK> journalist <UNK> unless mentioning name a few times <UNK> an homage this <UNK> is an utter fraud you will learn virtually nothing about in this film nor about the spanish civil war 1936 1939 nor about the special role of <UNK> in that war you also will not learn about the collective punishment inflicted on the heroic <UNK> people for years afterward by the <UNK> and <UNK> franco br br the footage of the <UNK> countryside is very beautiful of course but dies does not have an extensive and varied enough collection of such scenes to qualify as a <UNK> the large number of stills shown not very <UNK> images of the forest floor for example is the <UNK> indication of the <UNK> of ideas here the <UNK> drift of brothers marc and david during their camping trip does not produce compelling cinema on the contrary one's strongest impression is of a film made by and for <UNK> out middle aged hippies don't waste your time read a good book about the spanish civil war instead i recommend felix <UNK> anti <UNK> revolution and counter revolution in spain which contains a gripping account of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br barry freed
<START> and that's saying something no matter how bad a movie gets i'm normally able to sit through it so i can judge the full movie through this one i made it about 20 minutes br br maybe it was the dvd or maybe it was my <UNK> but i could not hear the dialogue even with the volume turned all the way up sound effects were fine so with the volume turned up to hear the dialogue i was blowing out my <UNK> with the effects as much as i wanted to see this thing through i wasn't going to sacrifice my hearing for it br br from what little i could tell about the plot the movie was one big flashback by the main character's daughter it seems the mother a military pilot had to flee her ship because the one person on her ship she trusted turned out to be one of the enemy and now he is pursuing her across a desert planet br br the only thing i liked about the movie was the look of the main character there was something i liked about her <UNK> br br oh well looks like this one is going into the <UNK>
<START> here is a much lesser known 50's sci fi with a little different twist an atomic <UNK> son is kidnapped and held for a <UNK> of the the father's atomic secrets br br this is a tightly <UNK> atomic sci fi thriller with great production values and above average acting even from the kid the atomic city actually has a movie feel to it unlike a lot of other 50's sci fi of this time which which came off more like an episode of a tv show br br the atomic city was also actually nominated for an academy award for best screenplay how many other 50's sci fi can <UNK> an academy award nomination br br great pacing tight direction and some superb location filming in the <UNK> atomic city of los new mexico make this one worth hunting down the <UNK> print in <UNK> is an above average transfer and makes for a great double feature with the atomic man br br recommended
<START> william shakespeare's plays are classified as comedy tragedy or history some of his most memorable and most often read creations provide us with <UNK> humor gentle poetry and hilarious slapstick some of them survive as unforgettable dramas of compelling depth and gravity regardless he was able to write with <UNK> skill and <UNK> <UNK> greatly to our young language so in what category lies the <UNK> of <UNK> i was very surprised to find it is one of shakespeare's comedies i had never before read it nor seen it but after watching this most recent film version i have decided it is neither and it is both this is one of many questions the viewer must try to answer when coming to terms with what is clearly a <UNK> and deeply <UNK> moral tragedy br br the players are introduced quickly and simply one of them firstly is <UNK> itself director michael <UNK> filmed the <UNK> scenes in the actual city creating an <UNK> vibrant <UNK> backdrop to the <UNK> proceedings to this scenery enters the youthful joseph <UNK> returning to <UNK> to see a dear old friend antonio jeremy <UNK> it seems the poor has heard of a princess whose father has died and has left to any potential <UNK> a <UNK> of sorts waiting at the fair <UNK> island estate are three small <UNK> br br only one of which contains images of the princess he who can guess the right one using only blind <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> written upon them will be <UNK> the father's huge fortune for life oh and his daughter and her eternal love in marriage i forgot to mention here the light comedy of shakespeare takes over the movie this <UNK> plot element drives the story and also fills up much of the film's screen time as a number of painfully eager <UNK> arrive at the island <UNK> <UNK> for and failing to earn this very wealthy hand in marriage but before any of this occurs very much lacking in <UNK> antonio to <UNK> him three thousand to pay for the lengthy journey he must take to have his shot at the prize br br antonio himself nearly <UNK> must reluctantly embrace <UNK> by seeking the financial aid of <UNK> al pacino one of countless jewish who keep the <UNK> economy <UNK> yet are <UNK> and <UNK> to no end by the city's christian majority thus they <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> and it is here the two <UNK> must go <UNK> does not hesitate to remind the two men of a certain incident where antonio insulted and <UNK> on him in the city market and he proudly <UNK> this man who frankly has a lot of nerve now coming to ask for help but help him <UNK> does he even <UNK> any kind of interest on the <UNK> most likely feeling he has no reason to be concerned if antonio will be able to <UNK> him within three months still one <UNK> demand is a pound of <UNK> flesh should he on their <UNK> this is an unsettling request to be sure for antonio and as well as for us but it appears that despite his <UNK> pride <UNK> does not really <UNK> seeing such a gruesome act occurring br br so here the dramatic <UNK> has been laid and while the film goes off to explore its <UNK> side with its love <UNK> and mistaken identities there still <UNK> the gloomy <UNK> of the <UNK> itself in the end what will become of this ominous <UNK> meanwhile we are left at turns to explore the true central character of <UNK> al pacino has ample dramatic weight to carry here and he does so with convincing <UNK> and passion there are times when he is given room for the <UNK> we have come to expect from such a colorful actor but his most impressive scenes are the ones where he <UNK> this energy showing a conflicted personality honest sincere and proud yet brooding vengeful and entirely <UNK> this is one of <UNK> most heartfelt performances to date and while the rest of the cast play their roles and convincingly it is pacino who really owns the film especially toward the end when shakespeare <UNK> this seeming romantic comedy with a <UNK> of a third act br br i shall not reveal much here all i can say is that it involves the initial <UNK> a mighty shoe one expected would drop sooner or later and does it ever by the end shakespeare has raised a host of <UNK> for his audience seemingly questions of faith morality law and mercy are thrown before us through the final scenes and while by <UNK> close the <UNK> position may seem clear to some we are left completely at odds there are winners and losers in this one but have the winners earned their <UNK> with good reason or have they in a larger sense ended out losing as well has virtue been rewarded or simply has justice in fact this time been just by the <UNK> finish some <UNK> are painfully clear and <UNK> sealed but the audience are to be the ones who really decide the verdict for all of those involved and for some the verdict is still out for the play as well comedy or tragedy the author has <UNK> <UNK> the intense courtroom finale with an ending of light <UNK> and pat romantic <UNK> is he saying that all is well that ends well or is this his final ironic <UNK> the <UNK> humor serves to set us up nicely for such a heavy crash and while it is also what unfortunately keeps the <UNK> of <UNK> from achieving the greatness of so many of shakespeare's other works it is still engaging amusing and thought provoking beyond measure
<START> inappropriate the pg rating that this movie gets is yet another huge <UNK> by the mpaa whale rider gets a pg 13 but this movie gets a pg please parents don't be fooled taking an <UNK> school child to this movie is a huge mistake there were numerous times i found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary br br but all that aside the cat in the hat is still a terrible movie the casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving <UNK> the beautiful kelly preston and the always likeable or <UNK> in this case alec baldwin are both good in their roles even though preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this the kids are <UNK> actors and it shows especially with <UNK> fanning fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen br br did i mention there was an <UNK> talking cat in this movie mike myers is absolutely <UNK> i didn't like him as the voice of shrek and i truly believe now that myers should not be allowed near the realm of children's films ever again his portrayal of the cat is a slightly toned down version of fat bastard and austin powers br br in the end the cat should not have come he should have stayed away but he came even if just for a day he ruined <UNK> minutes of my life <UNK> minutes of personal anger and <UNK> br br the cat in the hat may be the worst kids movie ever
<START> this movie was released originally as a soft x apparently with the explicit sex deleted later the producers <UNK> <UNK> money and re released it with the <UNK> scenes restored apparently only about 3 minutes i guess since <UNK> was of age it was held against her and her promising career came <UNK> to a halt i guess its all in the timing witness pam <UNK> career but ronald reagan was in charge during <UNK> we had not heard about nancy <UNK> affairs bill <UNK> and monica <UNK> were in full swing during <UNK> coming out br br the sex is just <UNK> on the cake both version satisfy this naughty musical is way above similar of others that were released at the same time
<START> committed doom and peter goes across the pond to take on the american justice system circa 1971 with this priceless piece of <UNK> paranoia that <UNK> so far left it falls over constantly is pure tourist as he <UNK> this our gang tragedy with cliché freaks hippies and black <UNK> <UNK> against trigger happy cops and military and a <UNK> court <UNK> made up of <UNK> <UNK> adults making poor fashion statements talk about a revolution br br in punishment park we have radical youth versus corrupt system as <UNK> convicted of crimes are given the choice of <UNK> or a three day trek across punishment park death valley and freedom of course the law <UNK> officials <UNK> their journey aren't about to play fair and combined with the <UNK> heat the fate of our protagonists looks sealed br br punishment park has elements of <UNK> in setting as well as theme trials are held under a large <UNK> <UNK> where <UNK> prisoners shout <UNK> at a hardcore love it or leave it group of such as members of silent majority for a peaceful america who <UNK> back neither group spends much time listening to the other and the proceedings sometime takes on a teen parent battle over the keys to the car look mostly its just one side saying what's wrong with america the other saying what's right with no one offering <UNK> for change meanwhile the punishment park <UNK> stumble endlessly about the <UNK> while cops with guns act like twelve year olds it kind of has the look and feel of some of my 70's college film making class when we were younger and knew more then than we do now br br peter has always been on the side of the underdog and the common man against what he <UNK> as a corrupt powerful few was a strong <UNK> of military atrocity in 18th century scotland that still <UNK> war game is a raw <UNK> look at nuclear aftermath that should be required viewing for all punishment park has its value as well but for other than intended reason vision today is a <UNK> example of the left in full <UNK> counter culture 70s paranoia and given the times vietnam kent state the chicago 7 such <UNK> <UNK> seemed not that great a distance from the truth but 35 years later the fever has <UNK> and punishment park with it's <UNK> narrow viewpoint is a pretty silly ride
<START> a very good film focusing on a very important issue <UNK> alcohol syndrome is a very serious birth <UNK> that is totally <UNK> if more families saw this film perhaps more children would not end up like adam <UNK> performs in one of his best roles ever this is an excellent movie that takes into account a very special family with very important needs this is not unlike thousands of families that exist in the united states today there are children struggling with this world wide the really important point here is that it all could have been prevented more people should see this movie and take what it has to say seriously it is well done with important messages handled in a <UNK> way
<START> a very watchable film and one which was eagerly <UNK> having seen the trailer a number of times br br the whole thing looks superb from the ludicrous efforts of the <UNK> upper class to distance themselves from the mediocrity to the lower class <UNK> just trying to keep their heads above the filth the film captures the spirit of the 18th century brilliantly br br <UNK> lee miller plays <UNK> extremely well though the part does not exactly stretch him and robert <UNK> seems a little wasted on <UNK> <UNK> colleague br br the real star of the show was undoubtedly ken who plays mr chance a kind of chief of police with an evil glee that set him out from the rest of the cast br br a great film and anyone that enjoys the colour and style of peter <UNK> films will love the look of this although the <UNK> of the plot becomes apparent before the 2 hours are up br br well worth a viewing
<START> now i understand that this took two months to shoot really i'm pretty certain my crew could do it in less than a week this movie sucked so bad i couldn't even pay close attention just more proof that <UNK> bearing women can't always save you from horrible writing acting and direction now i understand it was a no budget <UNK> but there is also no continuity and no real reason to not to turn it off and watch <UNK> or foreign news in a language you don't understand oh there are a few decent looking females showing the goods still there aren't enough sexy women alive to warrant watching this travesty <UNK> on the film industry one of the longest 80 minutes of my life i it out though with the help of my old friend jim <UNK> do yourself a favor and get your gun ready <UNK> you may want to use it after this hack job lastly the individual moron who left a comment before mine thought this was a great movie and loved it just more proof that siblings shouldn't pro create <UNK> burn captain j
<START> a rather lame teen slasher from <UNK> while the plot <UNK> on a fairly decent idea the writing is profoundly lame and two of the three main teens are <UNK> wooden the problem is that for the kids to go through with their plan they have to be far more reckless than shown but if they were that devil may care it would perhaps be hard for them to be likable so they end up being neither really in fact i only started enjoying the film when i started wishing for their death one of those movies where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police i realise we wouldn't have a movie if they did but it would be nice if we could believe that they actually wouldn't avoid
<START> the slasher sub genre has been pretty much exhausted in fact even by 1979 just one year after the supposed <UNK> <UNK> halloween which was released seven years after bay of blood was released the sub genre wasn't far from being exhausted but tourist trap represents one of the more original <UNK> the film follows the same basic formula as most slashers i e madman murders a load of kids but draws its originality from the fact that madman is shown from the beginning as opposed to an unseen <UNK> or a man in a mask and we actually get some insight into his character the fact that this killer also has <UNK> abilities including being able to control the wax <UNK> that fill his house adds to the originality we kick off with a great opening sequence which sees a young man fall foul of having a flat tire after finding himself in a gas station of terror the scene is amazingly creepy as the wax <UNK> <UNK> him and things fly from the shelves and it gives the audience a great insight into what is to come namely a very creepy horror film br br the acting credibility is as non existent as you would expect from a seventies slasher but to be honest it's not all that bad the girls look hot the boys don't really matter and chuck <UNK> is more than adequately creepy in the role of the psycho he's not exactly anthony <UNK> but still good enough it's not the acting that's the star of the show however and as you might expect the creepy atmosphere takes that prize wax models as proved by the likes of house of wax vincent price version are very creepy and the film makes best use of that fact there are very few things in cinema that can be frightening by simply being there but wax <UNK> are definitely one of those things the killer's special ability could easy have gotten in the way of the atmosphere but the film makes best use of this fact even by having various things fly off shelves and it goes well with the rest of the movie on the whole this is a very good film while tourist trap might not be absolutely essential viewing it's well worth seeing and i can recommend it
<START> although i watched this film by myself thankfully i still felt embarrassed while watching it i was tricked into renting it by the reviews on the front cover and the bloody gritty camera stills on the back which led me to believe it was some sort of documentary these actors are laughable throughout the entire film not convincing at all the story involves an italian australian gang just fighting other gangs and then running fighting repeat supposedly they train extremely hard which makes them way better than other gangs for some reason i don't believe that they could actually beat up some of these other guys that are twice their size i could be wrong no i'm not wrong this movie is not enjoyable on any level the jail montage looked like it was a summer camp just instead of kids it was a <UNK> fest of horrible actors just hanging out and laughing and trying to look hard this movie is not worth your time save your money or throw it in the garbage just don't waste it on this movie
<START> things i like steve as gus nails the part copies robert mannerisms which makes him feel comfortable to gus fans some of the other actors copy their predecessors style in this series as well karl urban looks grim and tough but can crack a joke and smile too which t l jones did in original series the gear the guns the clothing all accurate or very close to period accurate i'll never forgive <UNK> and duvall for having a in their in open range the they are actually riding rather than hiding a modern <UNK> under a <UNK> <UNK> and they aren't painted as politically correct peace loving but as a proud warrior people there are some dumb scenes but it beats the heck out of yet another variation on doing something stupid to not win a million dollars reality game shows
<START> i will admit i possibly missed tiny moments when i wasn't paying proper attention but i got enough of the story to agree that it is a great family film from director lionel <UNK> who played grandpa <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> bang bang basically it starts with a happy upper middle class family living in victorian london one night the father is visited by two strangers and he leaves with them and does not return they move to a <UNK> in the country and here the children <UNK> jenny <UNK> who i first saw in child's play 2 <UNK> sally <UNK> and peter gary warren keep their spirits up with their fascination for the nearby <UNK> everyday they wave <UNK> to the passengers in the passing trains and with courage and <UNK> they also avoid an accident and are made heroes their kindness makes them friends including important people who can help find the mystery of their missing father also starring <UNK> sheridan as mother mrs <UNK> bernard <UNK> as albert <UNK> william <UNK> as old gentleman peter as doctor forrest ann <UNK> as ruth and gordon <UNK> as russian it was number <UNK> on the 100 greatest family films and it was number 24 on the 50 greatest british films very good
<START> i have to admit thanks to this movie i'm now afraid of <UNK> <UNK> br br but yes first off the acting in this movie at least by my standard is pretty <UNK> most of the actors are pretty decent in their roles the script also seems to be pretty good too sure some cheesy stuff in there but also some <UNK> written character and some damn scary scenes i still get <UNK> thinking about that one scene with the dude and the <UNK> <UNK> br br yeah i'll say you should check this movie out it's pretty good and very entertaining a good watch 8 10
<START> other reviewers seem to have held this film in high regard for something made by an <UNK> year old film student i would say bravo but that is not the case if you want to watch a good movie about stick to the documentaries it is filmed with the same quality as a digital home video the two main characters are dismal actors and once again that would be okay if this were a student film the plot follows a lonely artist who <UNK> around <UNK> writing he is joined by another and they <UNK> around together creating art then comes the unnecessary gay love scene then comes the <UNK> between them that is never actually discussed because this film has about as much dialogue as a charlie chaplin picture this movie does show the gravity street artists give to their form well and the music is nice but overall i wouldn't really call it a film
<START> i love this movie though i don't like how they picture <UNK> being an egyptian citizen myself that's why it earns an eight out of 10 br br the relationship between <UNK> and the <UNK> is awkward and of course because of loneliness and living in that cave for quite so long he develops a kind of insanity and passion to that <UNK> br br a very touching scene when the <UNK> dies watch reaction br br all in all i find it enjoyable and i'm looking forward to reading the short story by <UNK>
<START> i was intrigued by the nasty boss character as i am one myself and the actual <UNK> daughter was attractive and it was interesting to see an even younger <UNK> but this movie is so <UNK> i had to turn it off it was a waste of time to watch it when people started <UNK> all over the living room it was too much to watch painful awful crap movie if they had just toned it down a little are there really people out there that find it funny and like it i was <UNK> to know that imdb readers rated it so low the career side to the story was intriguing as well as the young man trying to get a promotion and win the bosses favor i liked that part also the opening scene with the <UNK> on the train was cool as i like his characters if you can stomach non sense movies or you are pretty young then it might be one you can stomach
<START> the director does not know what to do with a camera too many <UNK> and she always always always picks the wrong one she let travolta take charge and he controls the movie from the beginning to the end the characters are not developed maybe because we need to watch them singing no pace at all sometimes too fast sometimes too slow <UNK> travolta ok johansson she is too grown up to be a 18 even if she is really 20 br br the happy ending well it looks like that there must be one so the story is sad but not too sad travolta doesn't know how to play a guitar but the director doesn't look she cares too much that he is totally out of <UNK> br br the idea is the only thing that is great but how she developed it well it is simply full of stereotypes and lines heard too many times br br too bad another missed chance
<START> this is actually a brilliant movie the story is grotesque but the actors are brilliant especially the performance of <UNK> as is magnificent it's a simple story about two guys with an urge to make it on their own but it unfolds to a strange and absurd story with a lot of people accidentally getting killed and served up as chicken if only more people understood danish this could be a great candidate for an english version it is also worth mentioning <UNK> who always delivers that extra twist to the plot with his slightly mad character i can only recommend this movie to the danish audience also take a look at adams 2005 a movie by <UNK> thomas <UNK> also with <UNK> accompanied by a well playing <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i truly fell in love with the characters they were very down to earth but each and every one of them had a hidden dark side sort of a mystery david himself was an <UNK> the secret fears and just secrets in general that he had there was a whole side of him that the other characters knew nothing about and it left the audience either wondering or assuming there was always a part of this man that he would keep hidden away yet he'd share a little of himself too he was the strong male lead character and i admire that type of character billy <UNK> himself is an incredible actor who could do just about any type of part he's an amazing talent and a good man his fans love respect and support him endlessly br br since this show he's gone onto many other projects and has stretched his acting ability quite a bit more and quite well kudos to him and all the other actors from this show for doing such an excellent job i wish them all well i wish the series would've continued on it's such a shame it didn't
<START> at least it is with this episode here we have a time <UNK> the professor from <UNK> island no less going back in time to <UNK> what does one do why try to save lincoln of course no really interesting variations are <UNK> on this old theme as another reviewer has stated this episode is particularly drab and with little to suggest that the professor really is back in the <UNK> budget limitations are readily apparent and the direction is <UNK> john <UNK> booth adds a spark but it remains a very flat production we too often feel we are on stage sets waiting for something clever to happen there is a minor twist at the end but i emphasize minor
<START> this was a very gritty movie about anti <UNK> however unlike <UNK> <UNK> that also deals with anti <UNK> the movie has aged well and doesn't seem heavy handed in other words it deals with the topic without seeming preachy or trite by today's standards br br robert ryan plays one of the most vile characters as he beats a guy to death just because he's jewish robert mitchum plays the investigator trying to get to the bottom of this crime br br i give the movie kudos for its gritty and <UNK> look at hate it is in many ways an example of film noir even though the topic isn't about the usual gangsters or robbery
<START> what an awesome mini series the original completely stole me away from anything else that was on far more engaging than the american remake the original boasts an amazing cast formed of lesser known actors to north american audiences juliette <UNK> being the mainly recognizable actress who plays a drug addicted <UNK> daughter of a government official but it's not star power that carries this film though i enjoyed the american version i felt it was <UNK> by the famous americans in the picture br br unfortunately i saw the american version before i found the original bbc mini series of course there were no picture <UNK> lush locales and the big name stars director however the <UNK> and <UNK> of europe through the perfectly <UNK> the impending sense of danger which <UNK> throughout this film the problems such as getting <UNK> off of drugs by giving them more poor anti drug <UNK> and the resistance of foreign <UNK> to assist with destroying their drug from within all make bold <UNK> and horrific all at the same time br br the truly incredible portions of the movie all come from <UNK> my god i never knew how bad the problem really was over in europe even all over for a real education on the problems of drugs beyond how they affect the human body you must watch both this and the american version each show one very clear and <UNK> fact those countries which are leaders in the eyes of the world have a culture that has led to the death and suffering for many br br drugs are worse than war they work in the shadows the dark secrets of any successful society
<START> first off acting is so terrible except for the actor who plays spencer <UNK> does not deserve her own show she should have stick with drake and josh the only person i like besides spencer is hes super bad he kicked <UNK> and i liked it br br the episode i hate a lot is i hate that young fan she made me almost kill myself fake is a well word to describe this please don't watch this nothing on tv is good go with classics like family matters good show <UNK> lets all go back to doug nick version only please don't watch i hate oh also nathan is a <UNK>
<START> i would think that this was one of those films whose director hadn't read the book it was based on were it not for the fact that they are just slightly similar it is certainly possible for a great film to be based very loosely on a book and this was certainly the latter but not the former br br there were a number of flaws one was that it tried to be too much like the <UNK> children probably because adults would expect this being from the same author another is that it also sought to be too like harry potter down to the music and in the setting i have nothing against j k or the films but the book is just nothing like the harry potter ones i thought the though very well voiced by eddie izzard and in character too was almost <UNK> in a totally inappropriate environment i may have missed something here as the comments made about one of the characters' own books may have been a reference to the <UNK> of the adaptation there was also no need for the extra characters and today's special effects could easily have been used to tell the story as it was written but they weren't br br i saw this film with my two children one of whom knows the book and the other of whom doesn't the one who does know it thought it was all right but wasn't as enthusiastic as the one who doesn't i'm not sure what this means
<START> the movie is not as funny as the director's <UNK> and only other movie shanghai <UNK> showtime did have its moments but it did not satisfy me why it needed to be so <UNK> i don't know but i give showtime
<START> there was a time when the alien series was a success with even the third installment alien 3 showing promise under the <UNK> of a fresh and young david <UNK> the first predator was a box office hit mainly due to its story in peak star arnold <UNK> and director john die hard the films alien aliens alien 3 and predator were all highly successful and created massive <UNK> among general film fans and science fiction fans alike arguably predator 2 and alien <UNK> should have <UNK> the end for both <UNK> but studios were <UNK> and saw the opportunity to <UNK> to the <UNK> among fans and combine the two step in paul w s anderson alien vs predator and now the brothers <UNK> visual effects <UNK> not even directors or writers the problem was that by allowing such profound and revolutionary creations of the sci fi genre to fall into the hands of firstly a mediocre director and now directorial has led to nothing more than profanity <UNK> by incompetence upon witnessing alien vs predator <UNK> die hard fans will feel sick to their <UNK> that this series could have got any worse br br one example of the cinematic <UNK> of this franchise is in the opening scene and is likely to cause <UNK> among fans the film begins with an alien making its way onto the predator ship <UNK> from the <UNK> chest growing in to a full grown and bringing down the predator craft which now seems to have far less <UNK> on it than it did at the end of alien vs predator and all this occurs with the ship still in <UNK> atmosphere once the ship has crashed quickly <UNK> to cheap plot methods and basic narrative conventions it makes no venture at <UNK> any of the twists or <UNK> served up in the two original films the <UNK> plot progresses with tedious pace <UNK> only by the near rousing conflicts of alien and predator and when that runs the risk of boring us we are treated to either an <UNK> blonde in a bikini or rapid <UNK> is plagued by an endless array of continuity errors and plot holes with little or no narrative <UNK> i e members of the public an elite military unit or the predator not <UNK> to laws established in previous <UNK> this is a film that has a complete disregard for its predecessors it breaks some of the most fundamental rules of a sequel and in doing so one gets the feeling that it is trying to set itself up as a stand alone feature <UNK> the film has no heart no conviction and no soul and with reference to the other films lacks even the most basic continuity this is <UNK> by the over <UNK> narrative of the film as it <UNK> the basic premise of the first alien because if the species had been encountered before then those in the first alien film would have been more <UNK> and not so ill prepared when <UNK> them br br on a cinematic note the film is close to being dire i felt <UNK> at some points to shine a torch at the screen the lighting was so bad through <UNK> such gloomy and dark effects the audience may feel as though they are being cheated out of some the action  which is ironically its purpose and also <UNK> the films lack of budget as with all science fiction one scene normally <UNK> as being the most memorable in this instance it is probably the hospital <UNK> scene as it ever so <UNK> draws on the themes of the original alien by it the directing is poor performances weak and the script rotten is the product of a <UNK> belt system of film making in which ideas and techniques are assembled by <UNK> people and then the finished product distributed among cinemas this is <UNK> by the absence of gory death scenes and drawn out blood battles because the <UNK> will not allow it  a lower <UNK> achieving a larger target audience was purely a business venture and nothing more
<START> i <UNK> enjoyed this short even as a toronto <UNK> <UNK> fan br br director <UNK> cohen and narrator <UNK> captured all of the boy's emotions perfectly from the feelings he had for his hero maurice rocket richard to the excitement anticipation and hope of getting a new <UNK> <UNK> soon to the look of horror on his face when he got his <UNK> from his mother a toronto <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was priceless and the shame of having to wear this dreadful in his eyes blue and white toronto <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> not the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of the <UNK> with <UNK> number nine like his old <UNK> and worst of all his mum made him wear this <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> out of the house you could <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> he would get from his friends when he hit the ice wearing that <UNK> before he got there br br i was laughing the whole time and this is one of the best animated shorts i've seen br br
<START> admittedly you can put a model airplane against a black background and call it sci fi and thats enough to get me interested so if you are like that black horizon will at least get you interested before you watch it the best part of the movie is when they rehash some actual footage of a <UNK> launch br br the movie plays like the naked gun series <UNK> cop dramas with bad clichés and bad acting unfortunately i don't think they meant to be funny the actors really are made of cardboard the dialog really does suck so well just have to laugh at them and not with them br br on a side note it is rare to see a movie that takes place half in outer space half on earth and doesn't mix in the expected <UNK> and supernatural events i really do <UNK> for more realistic drama based on our space <UNK>
<START> spoilers this review has been edited due to word limit br br the horror the horror ' marlon brando apocalypse now 1979 and apocalypse now <UNK> 2001 br br the sentence which is as famous as here's looking at you kid ' or are you <UNK> to me ' or may the force be with you ' or i'll be back ' means a little more than some one liners when it is spoken it <UNK> in the air with an importance and meaning that does not go <UNK> what might drive some viewers nuts is that they may never find an answer to the horror unless they re watch the film and try to pay close observation to every single frame br br what exactly does this line of dialogue mean the horror spoken of is the reality of war the reality of moral men being so easily <UNK> that they turn on their <UNK> instincts and kill fellow beings without any sign of guilt when capt <UNK> martin sheen stands before the dying <UNK> <UNK> marlon brando at the end of the film the horror the horror ' is the realization of <UNK> he has mercilessly killed a man in cold blood as part of his assignment this isn't a typical hollywood ending in most cases a character <UNK> something whether it be emotionally physically mentally or all three but <UNK> both <UNK> and loses he <UNK> the knowledge that he has lost his morals and that is a shocking ending br br apocalypse <UNK> is francis ford <UNK> tribute to the artistic side of filmmaking this film is wholly different from the godfather ' it is <UNK> visually dazzling and an <UNK> to the guilty side of human nature at first it seems realistic and then it becomes strange and then symbolic and by the end original in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of <UNK> this is not as much a film about the vietnam war as it is a film about the war within us br br at first it does appear to be another war film captain <UNK> sheen is assigned by an army lieutenant a young harrison ford to <UNK> a <UNK> american colonel named <UNK> brando who is hiding out somewhere in vietnam with a <UNK> of troops who more or less act as his slaves br br <UNK> carries out his mission with extreme prejudice ' heading out on a boat along with four soldiers including the boat captain chief albert hall chef <UNK> forest and a very young <UNK> fishburne who later went on to appear as <UNK> in the <UNK> br br apocalypse now is in a many ways a modern update of <UNK> odyssey as our main character <UNK> carries on his journey he meets an array of original and strange characters including lt <UNK> robert duvall who has a strange fetish for surfing and a stoned photographer dennis hopper whose lively gestures and mannerisms can be compared to those of the very much lesser jeremy davies in the million dollar hotel one of the worst films i have ever seen davies failed to make any connection with an audience hopper does he is like the poetic vibe between <UNK> and <UNK> he is like an <UNK> going back and forth and speaking in foreign languages in this case he is <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> although i'm not so sure <UNK> needs a translation of <UNK> br br many films are lucky enough to have one or two memorable scenes or lines apocalypse now has many <UNK> upon a vietnam village playing <UNK> ride of the <UNK> remains one of the most remembered scenes in all of film history there is <UNK> to it a brutality to it an ironic tone to it and also a sense of <UNK> when <UNK> down on that beach and says i love the smell of <UNK> in the morning it <UNK> like victory ' we all crack a smile br br i won't lie to you apocalypse <UNK> is a strange film it isn't exactly the <UNK> thing to analyze the end may <UNK> some viewers if they don't understand marlon <UNK> significant speeches but what it all comes down to what really matters is that this film is about the dark nature of the human psyche the horror is the realization of war and its effects not the war itself <UNK> says you have a right to kill me but you have no right to judge me ' <UNK> character <UNK> is left to the audience to judge to many <UNK> viewers he may appear as a crazy <UNK> whose power got to his head but that isn't what francis ford coppola is trying to get across by fighting in vietnam <UNK> has realized just how great he had it and how bad some others had it by walking through <UNK> <UNK> he eventually comes to realize that we are the <UNK> ones living our lives in a <UNK> paradise we are totally <UNK> to our surroundings and possible <UNK> until they hit by seeing how unlucky some <UNK> are <UNK> realizes just how easily he could be struck by something just how easily he could end up like the people around him and he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left them at the door many people think the horror is one thing it is two for <UNK> the horror is the reality of how <UNK> he was and the reality of the <UNK> impact upon men and after <UNK> murders <UNK> and hears dying words he realizes it too he realizes the effects of war to see so many soldiers with no sense of right or wrong makes him realize the horror of what war can do to a man and what it has done to him the horror br br 5 5 stars br br
<START> in the spirit of the great space coaster but a few years earlier br br hot <UNK> was one of the psychedelic kid's shows that i grew up on seymour was a big fuzzy green puppet with a <UNK> smile of enormous teeth which nearly split his head i recall him wearing a variety of <UNK> john type shades br br he played piano and had a jesus looking dude in a white <UNK> sitting next to him they would have a moral discussion and then do a song about it br br don't remember much else except the opening theme seymour and the hippie br br no one else i know remembers it at all i grew up in jersey so if it was produced in detroit as a previous post said it wasn't just local seymour reminded me a lot of sherlock the <UNK> from the magic garden another psychedelic kids show if there ever was one people always talk about effects of music and movies of the 70s but it seems kid's show writers got a dose as well
<START> the movie contains a very short scene of <UNK> in a <UNK> she looks absolutely stunning for a lady age <UNK> but this is the only saving grace of the movie otherwise it has a mindless <UNK> script and the lead actress has none of <UNK> appeal the director apparently watched too many peter <UNK> films and x comes across as a <UNK> imitation of the <UNK> style without any of his inspiration
<START> this is a wonderfully gritty drama <UNK> the various sides of the international heroin drug trade from the hills of northern <UNK> where the <UNK> allowed <UNK> of <UNK> occurs on a vast scale to the euro trash in germany and england who <UNK> the of <UNK> heroin in multi <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to the end users caught up in the web of addiction and the crime needed to support their growing habit and finally all the levels of international government corruption and <UNK> surrounding police efforts at controlling the drug problem this drama is <UNK> out with a wide array of in depth well rounded characters fully evolved plot and excellent character acting and location shooting br br this puts hollywood epics like the french connection in their place br br is a deeply thought provoking and suspenseful tale of modern drug related espionage and the international efforts of many people to try to eliminate it br br unlike many crime dramas revolving around drugs strongly on <UNK> the societal reasons that people slide into drug addiction as one of the characters puts it until we as a society <UNK> a world that people want to participate in instead of wanting to escape from we will not be able to stop people from taking drugs br br this is a fascinating and fully engrossing drama i highly recommend it
<START> this is a masterful piece of film making with many themes <UNK> and occasionally <UNK> over in this <UNK> and all study of the <UNK> <UNK> self indulgent wartime years that span the <UNK> of london and the <UNK> of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry <UNK> and <UNK> versus <UNK> and self sacrifice and more a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that <UNK> knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of close up camera angle and lighting including faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold it's as continuously beautiful to look at as a <UNK> but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that <UNK> work a very rare type of film these days it holds the attention and <UNK> the emotions without <UNK> artistic integrity and <UNK> to manipulative superficial <UNK>
<START> seen all 4 <UNK> this one is by far the best of all i <UNK> have much expectation when i got the dvd 3rd was such a drag but to my delight this one was fast paced with some slick punch lines br br don't miss this one
<START> it seems that there is great potential for the story line of this film to be something worth watching the acting was flat and the story lacked depth there was too much <UNK> on camera work which had some high points i have to agree with the other negative comments i only wish i had read them before buying the dvd the film may be worth watching for free and you are bored to tears before hand there could have been a lot more plot development with why there are homeless in <UNK> i e post soviet rampant drug usage i e <UNK> heroin <UNK> from afghanistan more development of why the <UNK> of russian <UNK> after the fall of the u s s r the <UNK> themselves or even more into the struggle against <UNK>
<START> is what is wrong with indie films for all of their hard edged commentary and attacking big subjects studios won't this is the sacrifice we make for nearly two hours i was subjected to the torture and pain of a film that starts by wandering like a blind man in a new place and ends without covering any new ground and thankfully dies br br there are parallel stories that detail a dying town and a dying boy two men dressed in black one of them james woods must <UNK> the remaining inhabitants of <UNK> to leave before a <UNK> opens up and <UNK> the town the other story has a boy returned to the priest nick nolte that gave him to the parents he is dying and is visited i guess by angels among them anthony <UNK> with bizarre <UNK> and <UNK> hannah in a bizarre costume reminding me of the pirate shirt from seinfeld br br though this is the plot it is not what the film is about the film is about nothing it does nothing says nothing goes nowhere and has nothing interesting to show perhaps by design more likely an after effect of the pretentious surreal david lynch wannabe we're an important artsy film can't you see style of direction the entire movie is <UNK> through a gray bleak backdrop that i suppose fits a film about death instead it simply makes the film that much harder to watch br br if you want to see a film about men in black see either <UNK> in <UNK> films neither too impressive but compared to they are lifted to <UNK> <UNK> status if you want to see a film about a boy dying watch oil ' if you want to see a film that has the destruction of a town through water watch <UNK> brother where art <UNK> ' if you want to watch a film better than ' there are hundreds if you want to watch a film that is worse there are only a handful 0 out of
<START> everybody interested in texas needs to have this dvd it's just a good movie about real texas with great scenes it took a bunch of <UNK> to do this right hollywood never would have gotten it there are so many subtle things that put in the movie and may not have even thought about but it makes the show br br guest cameos are not seen as cameos at all each star fits in perfectly and does not distract from the film many of the guests spots blend so perfect that when the credits roll you will go back through the movie to find the character roll is dead on it could not have been done any better in real life br br the second half of the movie is completely different from the first it <UNK> a little hokey but that's alright somehow the storyline works the hokey stuff is like an after school special but it looks believable and natural br br i have never heard anyone use the sonny <UNK> line before other than locals that i grew up with that was the <UNK> on the cake for me br br definitely a <UNK> right up there with pure country express jr <UNK> <UNK> the last picture show giant and of course <UNK> br br <UNK>
<START> when i saw the first <UNK> movie it was a laugh see the cheesy acting and appalling effects this film seemed to make up for the acting but not the special effects after jaws and <UNK> sure why not make a film about a killer <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> the new york waters where 2 police <UNK> try stopping the <UNK> beast before the 4th of july br br a pretty clean plot and descent happenings but the <UNK> was pretty much appalling its nice to see they actually made it this time but it looked like a piece of plastic better on a big budget really this film could have been a good watch there's a continuous amount of errors where it wouldn't surprise me if they didn't research the way <UNK> live br br watch this if you like cheap dvd sequels otherwise your better watching jaws
<START> <UNK> and <UNK> was the kind of film that you just had to go and see back in the late 50's when i was a kid a biblical epic spectacular with well known performers unusual costumes lots of extras and battle sequences so i went to see it but i remember that back then <UNK> and <UNK> didn't impress me at all which was a strange thing since i had enjoyed a lot the ten <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> helen of <UNK> and others the point is that when you are a kid you disregard things in pictures that adults don't bad acting for instance and you are easier to please with warriors in their <UNK> battles sword <UNK> and action so if <UNK> not impressed then something is wrong with a product of this genre br br this film though it has some of such features is definitely standard and average <UNK> wooden performance as the <UNK> king doesn't even light when he has <UNK> and half naked gina <UNK> dancing around him <UNK> she is better and <UNK> an acceptable acting george sanders doesn't look interested in what he is doing and marisa <UNK> twin sister doesn't add at all as a sort of conscience br br the final sword duel between <UNK> and sanders is just for the plot and lacks interest and intensity it had to filmed that's all br br not a good farewell for director king <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> will probably be remembered as <UNK> <UNK> last unfinished picture
<START> i viewed the reader at sugar which is not an <UNK> <UNK> for viewing anything and the movie was by far the highlight of the evening the technical elements were well <UNK> and it was obvious that <UNK> rogers had chosen his <UNK> and crew well but it was the story and it's delivery that truly made this short shine <UNK> <UNK> tight script was just what this evening of shorts needed it neither <UNK> as several offerings did or <UNK> to us the reader was simple story telling in it's best form well cast by rogers and beautifully acted <UNK> rogers is obviously a director with the ability to put all the pieces together i'm looking forward to his next finished project k
<START> after reading both river god and the seventh <UNK> i can't begin to express how disappointed i was with this film while i agree some poetic license may be <UNK> this movie is at constant <UNK> with the books doing an incredible injustice to the exciting plausible and wonderful stories written by <UNK> smith i can only believe that the writers director and producers of the movie have never even heard of mr smith let alone read his work smith's vibrant characterizations are converted into wooden stick figures all <UNK> is ignored or <UNK> the realism of the books has been changed to include phantom monsters more appropriate to a cartoon and why is an egyptian henchman speaking spanish no wonder the movie was made into a tv miniseries did <UNK> smith have any <UNK> into the making of this movie i can't believe that he did terrible terrible movie if you've read either or both of the books don't waste your time or money watching this money you will be sorely disappointed i assure you br br only a moment of supreme <UNK> <UNK> me to give this movie a <UNK> of <UNK> and that only because of the beautiful sometimes spectacular photography
<START> gordon goes over the top in typical full moon fashion but that's to be expected combs is surprisingly low key keeping his performance at a more realistic level than we are used to seeing also gone is the usual stuart gordon in black humor br br the film is quite effective in showing <UNK> break down and his final heroic act to save his wife daughter you actually feel sympathy for his character despite his short <UNK> br br personally i was more surprised at the nudity and borderline porno sex scene than i was shocked by the graphic violence gore br br not classic gordon but certainly something you might enjoy if you've seen his more famous films
<START> <UNK> follows the story of <UNK> p fitzgerald ryan <UNK> a <UNK> teenager who has apparently murdered a severely retarded <UNK> the brother of a girl he was dating the issue is not whether he did it or not  <UNK> admits to it straight away  but rather why interestingly rather than a crime drama <UNK> becomes a character story <UNK> why people do what they do  not necessarily the <UNK> ground to till br br and <UNK> features the required indie group of screwed up people aside from the title character there's also pearl don cheadle who is his teacher at the juvenile <UNK> facility and who sees straight off that <UNK> is different we meet distant and <UNK> father kevin spacey in an extended cameo who never seems emotionally <UNK> in any way by what his son did but the real <UNK> come out when we <UNK> ourselves in the the family of the retarded child first there's girlfriend <UNK> <UNK> malone a drug addict who can't keep herself clean her sister julie michelle williams perhaps the most normal person in the film who merely seeks to get away from it all and allen harris chris <UNK> a young man who lives with the and is <UNK> boyfriend lastly there's ryan michael welch whom all the others call <UNK> who cannot communicate and seems barely aware of his surroundings br br <UNK> focuses primarily on its eponymous protagonist but the movie slowly  occasionally too slowly  <UNK> into everyone's lives asking the chief question why do people do what they do while <UNK> <UNK> it openly in a <UNK> pearl allows him to keep <UNK> notions of good and bad and personal responsibility all the characters at some point in the film face a moment where they must make the fundamental choice of their own happiness or <UNK> perhaps the most basic choice any human can make and the movie takes a good look at what goes into those choices and the consequences of them br br in the beginning of the film you're simply struck by the depth of the cast spacey cheadle <UNK> michelle williams even chris <UNK>  these are people who for the most part tend to elevate any film they are in and putting them all together makes for a <UNK> <UNK> for a space in the middle the film seems to <UNK> <UNK> along as it unfolds it looks for a while as if it will be content merely to ask questions and not supply any answers but when we arrive at the home stretch and the movie starts to hit its <UNK> and come together <UNK> becomes a quietly powerful piece of film making explanation of the world and his actions in the end bring every story into focus and all the investment you've made in the film pays off br br saying ryan <UNK> is excellent is like saying a sunny day is nice at this point in his career it's redundant  this is one of the finest young actors working today and it is a pleasure to watch him craft what could have been an unlikable character into a thought provoking protagonist <UNK> employs such subtlety here that it hardly seems like acting he has to face off most of the film opposite don cheadle whom we know has the goods and he not only holds his own he <UNK> <UNK> game as well cheadle himself is in top notch form <UNK> pearl with a fully rounded humanity  for good and bad spacey is kind of one note but that's the character and he handles it excellently i was surprised by chris <UNK> with this level of acting i thought he would be buried in the mix but he gives probably the turn of his career so far terrific work all around br br <UNK> is a bit of a <UNK> and again it's <UNK> in spots but it finishes strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer on this one anyway there's also a subtle commentary on racism in the film in first day in juvenile hall class he's the only white person in the room that like much of the movie is very effectively handled i wouldn't go so far as to call this required viewing  some might find it too slow or too odd  but i thought it was one of the better films i've seen in a while far stronger and more satisfying than most fare out there i'd recommend it  with the above <UNK>  if for no other reason than to watch <UNK> further perfect his craft
<START> this is the worst italian movie ever quite possibly the worst movie of all time joe <UNK> is of course no cinematic genius but many of his movies are interesting and watchable <UNK> this is not one of them its cheesy and boring <UNK> boring if you want a movie to mst3k get <UNK> 2 if you want a movie to put someone into a coma get deep blood
<START> a dull <UNK> through the <UNK> of mormon utterly un funny a testament to the widely held theory that in order for bathroom humor to be funny it must necessarily be vulgar it also <UNK> the claim that a close relationship with jesus makes you not funny more propaganda than film don't worry about any <UNK> social issues coming up at the dinner table after this one the saving grace of this movie is its accurate portrayal of young mormon females as particularly attractive oh well its your 7 50
<START> i have heard that was compared to <UNK> for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering from short term memory loss well that's like comparing the silence of the <UNK> and friday the 13th as both involved a character that killed multiple people they couldn't be further apart in ideas br br deals with a <UNK> man at a company who does have short term memory loss he is consistently followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office in comes a <UNK> who also gets involved with him and may may not use him for sex needless to say he has a lot of on screen sex br br wait there's more there's a boy who runs into the troubled <UNK> male and it's obvious there's more to this boy just <UNK> into him and there's a <UNK> the man keeps to try and remember important clues br br i admit i am not one for foreign made films i don't mind reading the subtitles but i do mind that sometimes that takes away from one of my favorite aspects of a film great dialogue since they have to translate or i wouldn't be able to understand for the most part i truly believe they <UNK> what the characters have to say this movie was no exception the dialogue was just well blah br br as for the story it was interesting enough to keep me around for 98 minutes weird yes but then again i don't live in france so i am not as familiar with their likes dislike or <UNK> such as i guess it's acceptable for a father to lie with and <UNK> in the buff with his son on the beach  that must be a cultural thing thankfully it wasn't two hours of time invested in watching this man regain his past and <UNK> move forward to his cure for when the secret is learned i was like really well okay then br br i can only recommend for somewhat decent acting good looking folks and soft porn sexual situations like every 2 4 minutes however if you're not into that sort of scene i would <UNK> skip this slow moving and memory <UNK> film
<START> when you watch low budget horror movies as much as i do you get to where you can tell who was involved in creating the movie as each film maker adds his own flavor to the cheese such is the case with jack o when i watched this truly awful movie i was left with the <UNK> feeling that fred <UNK> ray was involved maybe not as director but in some fashion and as i <UNK> i found that i was correct only fred and a of others could write something this pathetic and this movie just <UNK> of fred <UNK> ray unless you like fred <UNK> ray and god only knows why anyone would avoid this movie if you're going to rent an <UNK> ray <UNK> rent hollywood chainsaw <UNK> it's the only bright shining star in <UNK> <UNK> dark <UNK> universe of terrible movies
<START> i won't bore you with story and plot lines as they have been presented many times already on this page <UNK> it's been along time coming since i have seen such a film beautiful elegant and restrained with a narrative pace to match a film with sensitivity and understated qualities that is rare in these times of clichéd plots the beautifully subdued photography <UNK> in rich <UNK> colors and for lack of better words each frame is filled with an air of tension the settings and locations are used repeatedly but the film manages to breath new life into them each time they featured there always seems to be a key prop light <UNK> or set piece to slightly clue the audience as to where we are in the characters world br br the acting reminds me of the the <UNK> thief not the style but the fact that you forget that you are watching two actors engaged in their craft there is meaning behind every gesture and almost every movement has assigned significance to explain the inside world of the characters the relationship the feelings and situation of the two lovers the dialogue is sparse but like the rest of the movie is <UNK> with meaning speaking of meaning the soundtrack is <UNK> used here it becomes a story telling device and although the film is of chinese origins even a song sung in spanish by <UNK> king cole <UNK> the film with subtle meaning the <UNK> soundtrack is repetitive but the <UNK> is what makes it comfortable it is used in <UNK> with the story and not just a means to put music to action or to cue the audience to feel a certain way at a certain plot point br br i would not recommend this film to anybody i fear most people would be jaded by the calm flow of the story but i would recommend it to someone who is looking for an alternative to the romantic schlock that fills the <UNK> on our side of the world i must say that i was completely taken by this film and continued to watch it night after night the story takes time to present itself and bears repeated viewings as very few films in this genre are open to such a broad interpretation a very beautiful movie
<START> set in the lethal <UNK> 2 is a dreary early 90s martial arts action flick which sees a reckless cop hunting down the nasty criminals who killed his wife a rather cheap looking production with almost no artistic merit this film relies on the quality and <UNK> of its action but whilst there is no <UNK> of <UNK> gun fights and explosions the quality is just not there the endless battles are desperately lacking in originality or excitement with poor editing and mundane direction making this film a real chore to sit through br br the usually impressive is totally wasted with her natural athletic ability overshadowed by some excruciatingly bad wire work the <UNK> action scenes are an unimpressive mixture of <UNK> motion flying through the air whilst <UNK> crazy vehicle stunts and endless bad guys <UNK> up to be shot br br with so many better examples of the <UNK> and genre now available on dvd i suggest that you leave this one well alone unless like me you'll endure pretty much any old rubbish in order to be a <UNK>
<START> downhill <UNK> is essentially a movie to see only for the terrific <UNK> sequences although there is a story here robert <UNK> character a <UNK> trying to make the u s olympic team is so bland and unsympathetic that you wonder why to care about him at all gene hackman in an early performance adds nicely but this is a film that could be watched with the sound off and it wouldn't make much of a difference
<START> i remember seeing this movie back when it was released and i still remember the <UNK> i felt when i left the cinema everything about this movie is magnificent the music is top notch and i still play the soundtrack after all these years br br i have seen this movie so many times and yet i still get <UNK> to watch it again and again nicholas cage was great and whenever i see cameron <UNK> in anything nowadays i always associate him with this movie it is too bad the rest of the cast didn't go on to greater things but maybe that is part of this film's charm br br i won't do a film school critique as i am sure all the <UNK> out there can find fault if they wanted to but what i will say is that this movie defined my teenage years and still continues to influence my life over 20 years later the movie <UNK> great and <UNK> up emotions when you watch it well it did for me and i cannot recommend it highly enough for anybody who has not yet seen it br br you either <UNK> the movie or you don't those of you who <UNK> <UNK> will be rewarded with a unique movie experience
<START> i watched the movie about 13 <UNK> ago while living in beach <UNK> australia i had found it in the shelves of a little shop in the back that most don't bother to <UNK> br br to my pleasure i found it and watched it with the intention of one day <UNK> it and being in my collection i still do not have it but will one day br br i like the concept with the poetry and the fantasy the semi deserted street scenes with a busy <UNK> city in the far background added to the visual effect br br i have numerous times mentioned this movie to people that enjoy this genre with nothing but praise it has stuck in my mind and will for a long time to come br br i fully recommend this film but only to those that are into this type br br this comment and the one from la <UNK> can assist you when choosing to watch this film the comments may be negative but i found them positive if you look past the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> black rain was released in 1989 just at the <UNK> of the aids <UNK> a fact that gives the film about the slow <UNK> of <UNK> radiation victims an added <UNK> the black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash <UNK> <UNK> and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion there have been other books and films about the dropping of the atomic bomb but none as unique and powerful as this one based on a novel by who gathered information from interviews and the <UNK> of real life bomb victims the film depicts how an entire family is affected psychologically as well as physically by the bomb years after the original explosion it is a horrifying vision but one that <UNK> with deep compassion for humanity br br the film begins in <UNK> on august 6 1945 as soldiers and civilians go about their normal daily activities suddenly a <UNK> light flashes and a <UNK> blast is heard almost every single building is destroyed or damaged beyond <UNK> the first atomic bomb ever dropped on a city is now a part of history survivors must somehow <UNK> their lives unaware of the devastating after effects filmed in high contrast black and white the story centers around <UNK> a young woman who is caught in the <UNK> rain as her boat heads back to the city to search for friends and relatives in <UNK> <UNK> shows us <UNK> images that remain with us a young boy with skin hanging from his body <UNK> with his brother to recognize him an older man is in tears over his inability to free his son from <UNK> of <UNK> a mother is in torment as she rocks the <UNK> body of her child br br when the family returns to their rural home life is forever changed she sees her friends dying around her and waits for the inevitable <UNK> of radiation sickness that have already affected her uncle <UNK> <UNK> and aunt pretending that there is only business as usual the family <UNK> that the bomb has affected she forgot how <UNK> and <UNK> were destroyed everyone forgot it they forget the hell of fire and go to <UNK> like an <UNK> festival i'm sick of it says a friend <UNK> <UNK> the tragedy feeling shame for being different than others and guilty for being <UNK> br br when her aunt and uncle try to find her a husband the <UNK> men refuse to marry her because of <UNK> about her health even though has copied her diary to prove that she wasn't directly exposed to the bomb the only <UNK> she feels comfortable with is another damaged man who has a panic attack every time he hears the <UNK> of an engine at the end the beauty of life shows itself ever so <UNK> when goes to the pond and sees a sight she has been longing for all her life the king jumping in the water <UNK> as if to say that beyond despair there is still joy sadly we hear on the radio statements by politicians about using the bomb once again in the korean war human beings learn nothing says they <UNK> themselves <UNK> peace is better than a war of justice why can't they see black rain has hopefully allowed all of us to see more clearly
<START> okay so it was never going to change the world and it bombed at the box office but <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is one of those films i fell in love with as a child the bbc showed it a few times during the 1980s and i happened to have a high quality vhs tape in the machine lucky that and watched endlessly i watched the dvd last night and sadly time has not been kind to this would be blockbuster either that or i've just grown out of this kind of broad dopey humour come on when <UNK> is so desperate for laughs he gives us close ups of novelty <UNK> with <UNK> what can you say about the cast or screenplay br br certainly it's ambitious interesting unusual and <UNK> but it's never once laugh out loud funny i'd describe it as a children's film with some <UNK> overtones you can safely let your youngsters watch this despite the 15 <UNK> they won't get the drug references so don't worry about it i had a pleasant surprise when i realized i'd forgotten just how catchy both the title song and the song writing truck <UNK> <UNK> going faster song were not to mention the town of patriotic <UNK> the whole cast give commendable performances the photography is crisp and captures the mood of the various locations perfectly and there's a real time capsule feeling about the fashions the cars the <UNK> especially the <UNK> <UNK> drum machine the interiors and the pop culture references i was more than a little surprised to hear the nutty bum in the bank <UNK> telling everyone i'm <UNK> simpson particularly now <UNK> legal <UNK> have overshadowed his sporting achievements the <UNK> is there's almost no plot to speak of it's way too obvious to be witty and not funny enough to <UNK> many genuine laughs i wish i'd left this one as a pleasant memory
<START> this is one of the best movies i have seen in years i took me to a new time and place it was as though i was right there with ray through his many trials and <UNK> jamie foxx transformed himself into ray during the movie he was ray also <UNK> washington sharon robinson and <UNK> king were superb the movie was well cast and directed the music was fantastic br br i've seen the movie four 4 times with different people and the last time was just as enjoyable as the first time i will buy the dvd as soon as it is released this is a movie that will viewed over and over for years to come br br thank you for a great experience
<START> it was poorly shot looks like a rush job last minute casting is obvious writing is very weak good for stage not film i feel bad for andrew mccarthy he's a very good actor who has not been getting good roles lately this role was not for him maybe glad it has been picked up yet on the festival circuit this film shall stay
<START> in the 70's in afghanistan the boy <UNK> and the boy <UNK> ahmad khan who is his loyal friend and son of their servant ali are raised together in father house playing and on the streets of a peaceful <UNK> <UNK> feels that his wise and good father <UNK> blames him for the death of his mother in the delivery and also that his father loves and prefers to him in return <UNK> feels a great respect for his father's best friend khan shaun who supports his intention to become a writer after <UNK> winning a competition of runs to bring a <UNK> to <UNK> but he is beaten and raped by the brutal in an empty street to protect <UNK> the coward <UNK> witness the assault but does not help the loyal on the day after his birthday party <UNK> hides his new watch in bed to frame the boy as a thief and force his father to fire ali releasing his conscience from <UNK> his <UNK> and betrayal in 1979 the russians <UNK> afghanistan and <UNK> and <UNK> escape to <UNK> in 1988 they have a simple life in california when <UNK> <UNK> in a public college for the pride and joy of <UNK> later <UNK> meets his <UNK> <UNK> and they get married in 2000 after the death of <UNK> <UNK> is a famous novelist and receives a phone call from the <UNK> khan who <UNK> secrets about his family forcing <UNK> to return to in <UNK> in a journey of redemption br br i am not familiar with the <UNK> culture and i did not read this novel in spite of the recommendation of my daughter and yesterday i decided to watch this movie on dvd i found a good story of loyalty <UNK> betrayal and redemption with a brief insight in the recent history of afghanistan from a peaceful period in the 70's to the present days with the <UNK> the actors and actresses have great performances giving credibility to the realistic story the <UNK> locations in china recall the images we see in television from afghanistan in the end i found the <UNK> runner a good movie my vote is seven br br title brazil o de the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> may contain spoilers sadly lou last film has the distinction of being slightly better than <UNK> last movie together dance with me henry this movie isn't all in all outright terrible it is an amusing career misfire dorothy is nice to look at and makes the movie somewhat bearable you can't blame lou <UNK> for this because a major studio released it which meant somebody had to give it the green light in my opinion lou <UNK> was getting over problems of his own losing his son a few years earlier and the <UNK> attacks from the irs if you look at the last 3 4 <UNK> <UNK> movies you can notice the magic was gone check out dance with me henry now that's a painful movie to watch
<START> i am a huge amy adams fan and have been for many years i am also a big fan of musicals with that said this is not a good movie on any level it is quite dull and the acting overall is very very poor amy adams is awkward to watch act with scott g anderson due to the fact that she is in another league when it comes to acting all the performances come off as very amateur the music performances are pleasant but nothing special br br scott g anderson is just an bad actor i assumed he was put in this movie because he has a great voice but it's just not the case he has an average voice and sings on key but that's about it br br i guess i can see why amy adams did this movie with the singing element i just wish she had not i could rant about other poor elements of this movie but i'll leave it at that
<START> thanks to the of a fellow imdb member i've just managed to watch this film for the second time in nearly twenty years and i can honestly say it hasn't lost any of its kick i can't believe that channel 4 have let this one <UNK> without a trace as it is an extremely powerful moving and <UNK> take on the consequences of misplaced loyalty br br it focuses on a <UNK> of friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two <UNK> from school specifically how they use one and mercilessly torment the other as events from both the past and present unfold the tension gradually <UNK> not <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> excellent revenge <UNK> dead man's shoes the acting writing and direction are very bold for 1983 and still pack a <UNK> today in spite of the upper <UNK> accents of the central characters yes it might be set in public school but it's worlds apart from anything put out by <UNK> <UNK> i got a state education and can still draw countless <UNK> from the story br br this is a film that you'll remember for a long time if you see it except you probably won't because channel 4 or <UNK> have chosen to bury it on their own official website they describe it as an inexplicably overlooked gem from the early days of channel 4 overlooked by who this was one of the very first channel 4 films which would later go on to become <UNK> thanks to the success of films like <UNK> so somewhere someone must still have the master print in these days where you can get extended <UNK> issue dvds of more or less anything it's a bit moody that they can't give a film this good the promotion it deserves br br so if one of the channel 4 production is reading this stop making <UNK> that showcase people <UNK> themselves in the hope of <UNK> a <UNK> deal chase up this film and sort out a nice special <UNK> edition disc or something please
<START> when i saw lauren bacall do <UNK> flower on broadway i never <UNK> that one day i would see an actress like ingrid bergman playing the bacall role on screen but here ingrid really lets her hair down for some good comedy moments as the dental nurse pretending to be walter <UNK> wife so he can go on with the he's told goldie hawn br br it's a story played for laughs from beginning to end good <UNK> stuff that never runs out of dry humor and wit throughout its running time there are plenty of one liners or gags that are way above the usual situation comedy stuff one hears on tv the lines ring true because they blend so well with the characters and their motives br br as the <UNK> girl who <UNK> in the beginning committing suicide over her unhappy affair with matthau goldie hawn fresh from her days as a star on tv's laugh in does a dumb blonde role to perfection easy to see why she won that supporting actress oscar br br ingrid is surprisingly <UNK> in a rare comedy role although there are times when she seems just a bit too <UNK> for the part at any rate she's a surprising choice to play the nurse who puts on a freeze act at the office but is considerably <UNK> off duty br br as <UNK> next door neighbor <UNK> rick <UNK> <UNK> himself admirably and makes a suitable match for her in that final scene br br matthau plays the kind of character that became his stock in trade in all those neil simon roles he had a lovable <UNK> who gets caught up in his own <UNK> when he tells lie after lie br br it's the kind of <UNK> <UNK> comedy that'll have you laughing out loud at some of the amusing lines that <UNK> <UNK> and i a l diamond have managed to <UNK> together based on a french farce
<START> what is this its so bad the animation looks so terrible it looks like a <UNK> type game the actors are awful they just cannot act to save their lives i sat through all of this film an then at the end i was annoyed when i realised i had wasted 3 hours of my life i've not heard of this film did it ever actually come out in the cinema or did it go straight to dvd a girl got shot what is up with that it was just a stupid film they totally copied 'the day after <UNK> its got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen i would definitely recommend to people to not waste their time with this you could spend your time watching 'the day after <UNK> its a lot better well thats what i think of the film actually why have i wasted my time writing about it ah <UNK> its really annoying me its wasted 3 hours and 10 minutes now
<START> i saw the first house of the dead and expected a root <UNK> to be more pleasant to attend so when it wasn't as bad as that i was delightfully surprised br br unfortunately i then got my hopes up that the second one might be okay as well and i was wrong br br apparently i'm one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was bad br br i don't know whether to watch it again and force myself to see whatever all the people who gave it good reviews saw or wonder if i saw the wrong movie br br ed quinn as <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> as alexandra morgan did a great job in roles that were way beneath them they deserve to be in better movies br br the special effects were okay and some of the characters likable hate able and that made for a tolerable watch but for the most part this movie was just a waste of time br br oh and i have to ask this because i found myself asking it <UNK> all the way through the movie did anyone not know how to close doors behind themselves so zombies wouldn't just wander into the rooms only once did it happen zombies wandering in and i found that a little convenient soldiers walk into a room leave the door wide open pay little to no attention to same said door so the zombies can just walk in if they feel like it with the hapless being <UNK> with no way to escape and yet only once did zombies follow them in br br <UNK> maybe but honestly if i was fighting for my life the last thing i'd do would be to walk into a room and leave the door wide open so zombies could <UNK> in and eat me br br that is really the only thing bothered me throughout the movie and just the movie for the most part was a bad sequel to a not totally <UNK> original
<START> a sweeping and deeply moving love story featuring powerful performances from ralph <UNK> willem <UNK> and juliette <UNK> br br it tells the story of a badly burned man ralph <UNK> who gets pulled out of a plane <UNK> during world war two and tells his nurse juliette <UNK> his story br br just before the war he fell in love with the beautiful <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> scott thomas however she is married to <UNK> <UNK> colin <UNK> and the two begin a passionate and forbidden affair br br a very haunting and tragic story of love and desire set against some absolutely gorgeous locations in the desert a must see especially if your a fan of anthony work but be prepared to shed a lot of tears its very moving especially at the end
<START> agreed this movie is well shot but it just makes no sense and no use as to how they made 2 hours seem like 3 just over a small love story br br this could have been an episode of the bold and the beautiful or the o c in short please don't watch this movie because there is a song every 5 minutes just to wake you up from you're sleep i gave this movie 1 10 cause that was the lowest and no this is not based completely on a true story more than half of it is made up i repeat the direction of photography is 7 or 8 out of 10 but the movie is just a little too much the actor's <UNK> voice just makes me want to go blow my nose unless you are a real him <UNK> fan this movie is a huge no no
<START> thriller is brilliant it is a long video but simply brilliant nonetheless the song itself is excellent add michael jackson dancing and you have a golden phenomenon out of all the videos i have ever seen this is the best if you have not seen the video yet then i urge you br br the special effects are amazing for it's time everything from the transformation to the idea of these creepy zombies slowly raising from their graves is grand grand that is price has his segment of bone <UNK> lines known simply as the rap <UNK> ray does good as michael's girl and michael jackson himself the dancing and singing although not during the video itself is <UNK> br br 10 10
<START> who won the best actress oscar for 1933 it should have been laura hope for her magnificent portrayal of the most monstrous mother ever she truly is one of the great character actresses of all time she played the <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> 1936 and her best remembered role is aunt in gone with the wind br br irene dunne was the official star of the film but her scenes with laura hope were dynamite br br david joel <UNK> is in <UNK> when he is offered a job in new york his wife christine irene dunne can continue her studies at the centre their first stop in america is a visit to david's mother mrs <UNK> to say that laura hope <UNK> every scene is an under statement from her first entrance in a frantic burst of effort to <UNK> her big boy all attention is on her even sitting around the tea table when she forgets existence even forgetting how she takes her tea you know something is not quite right <UNK> has been living there for a while br br frances dee is completely sweet and so right in her role as the adorable <UNK> her performance in this film especially the scene where she has <UNK> and the aftermath proves how under rated as an actress she was br br all the young cast are excellent eric <UNK> is superb as robert the younger son who comes to the realization that his mother is horrible but can do nothing about escaping from his mother's spell joel <UNK> at one point says painting <UNK> on <UNK> that's more your style there is a very subtle suggestion in the film of <UNK> sexuality br br irene dunne is excellent in whatever film or genre she tried
<START> turner and friends are closing in on hbo for the top spot among made for tv movie producers this is a nicely paced <UNK> thriller of sorts william macy is stellar as always and adam arkin offers one of his better performances a bit more lively than classic hitchcock but not as in your face as typical movies of its type a slight case of murder <UNK> you in and never lets go note i saw a preview copy which means i didn't have to wait through commercials those <UNK> may hurt the pacing but you know this will be available on video sometime
<START> where do i start first off the story sucks the acting sucks the effects really suck i guess i'll start with the story the story for <UNK> vs <UNK> number one it doesn't explain how or when the <UNK> and the <UNK> even got there or for that matter how it was created the acting terrible it seems like the director just pulled a few people from the street which is probably what he did and last and definitely the least the effects they are so horrible that the <UNK> doesn't even look like a <UNK> just a dinosaur that looks incredibly unrealistic the water doesn't even move when the <UNK> appears all in all terrible piece of crap don't even think about renting it
<START> christopher guest is the master of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is one of many documentary <UNK> out there penn isn't good at either but he could certainly take a lesson from the other two guest often plays around with reality and fiction but the line between the two is always clear in his films sort of an essential with a <UNK> penn could also take a lesson from the the blair witch project even though you knew it was a fake documentary going in you totally bought into the world the filmmakers created it seems to the audience as if the whole thing is real even though you know deep down you're watching fiction in other words it was fiction successfully disguised as truth in fact many early audiences watching it at sundance and other premiere audiences thought it was real penn whose <UNK> by his own admission is screen writing should probably stick to that documentary or <UNK> film making and it's hard to tell where one begins and the other ends with this film is obviously not br br penn sets the stage for what he tries to sell as a <UNK> documentary on the filming of a documentary sort of a <UNK> documentary penn however <UNK> the audience and loses their trust from the get go as he enters <UNK> house before the filming of <UNK> film <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> about the myth of the <UNK> <UNK> monster a film which apparently was never finished  probably because of <UNK> <UNK> even though penn is apparently the director of the film we're watching he starts it by looking at the cameras and saying what is the film crew doing here and starts <UNK> away from them he does this on a couple other occasions as well he will stop and tell the cameras to stop filming thus forcing the camera guy to hide in the shadows to pick up snippets of dialogue between <UNK> and penn it seems to be a gimmick but that is never made clear and penn is apparently keeping us in the dark intentionally this leaves the audience scratching its head wondering who is in charge here if penn is working against his own film crew what kind of a world are we a part of this is just one of many examples of how he <UNK> the line between reality and fiction br br penn seems to only fully enter the fictional world i think when the crew has <UNK> of what appears to be the <UNK> <UNK> monster but by the time the monster makes its first appearance we have totally <UNK> the fictional world penn has attempted to create so it all just seems silly and pointless br br this is a potentially fascinating movie and a real missed opportunity in that penn has a chance to document a master at work but completely loses focus and it becomes a movie about penn and his antics instead of the filming of a documentary <UNK> presence begins to and <UNK> everything else in the movie br br the <UNK> interviews are convincing and we actually believe he isn't acting we even start to wonder if he and others on his crew are being <UNK> by penn much the way the audience is but you're never sure of even that penn in his interviews to the camera attempts to be quirky and unintentionally funny like the characters interviewed in a guest <UNK> but he only succeeds in being annoying in a guest film this effect is hilarious while here it falls flat because you're never sure what penn is about as a result we the audience start to dislike him as much as the crew apparently does aside from the beautiful scenery and the superfluous appearance out of nowhere of a beautiful model thrown in to give the movie spice there is little to recommend here perhaps its only redeeming quality an unintentional one at that is that it's a great example of why the audience is important and by completely ignoring the conventions of storytelling your doing them a <UNK> for that reason alone i think this would be a good film to show to film students  sort of a what not to do kind of movie i have nothing against a movie told in an unconventional way as long it's done <UNK> with a <UNK> base to give it substance this film is completely lacking in that br br i'd like to call it a <UNK> effort at something but i'm not sure what it is other than a complete mess and ultimately a waste of time br br as a side note it seems like bad art always calls to mind good this film made me think of the book picture by <UNK> ross ross followed john huston around during the filming of the red <UNK> of courage and brilliantly documented it for the new <UNK> it would make a great movie in fact if you want a great example of <UNK> art read it
<START> i watched this movie for the first time the other day and was bored to tears i guess i just was looking for some flashback to the wonderful series that i remembered i watched the <UNK> squad television show <UNK> back in the day and it was fantastic it was action packed and the relationship the 3 had with <UNK> was endearing there wasn't any of that here when <UNK> was murdered you get the idea that these 3 could have cared less the actor who portrayed pete is a really good actor but they wrote his part like he was mentally challenged pete in the television series was quiet and serious but had a funny side also they had this guy acting like he was either on drugs on the time drunk or just plain ignorant i wouldn't recommend this movie at all especially if you were a fan of the tv series it will be a complete letdown
<START> i can only think of one reason this movie was released to capitalize off the upcoming fame of guy <UNK> this movie has no merit at all and needlessly <UNK> errol <UNK> memory the homosexual encounter was pure <UNK> the disdain shown for flynn in this movie is <UNK> an easy way to <UNK> an actor who died years ago horrible and embarrassing very disappointing don't waste your time on this utter trash watch my wicked wicked ways if you want to learn about this fine actor or read his autobiography this movie is not the way
<START> while <UNK> at an isolated <UNK> house a teen girl is <UNK> by an <UNK> murderer on the <UNK> br br remake of the 1979 semi classic horror film basically takes the opening 20 minutes of the original film and stretches it out to fit an <UNK> minute time span so it's pretty needless to say that the plot of this remake is pretty thin there's little in the way of originality or interest in this movie there's a lot of <UNK> belle wondering around a dark house wondering who's calling her and <UNK> all kinds of false scares it all gets <UNK> and routine after the first 30 minutes and never manages to <UNK> up much in the way of suspense or chills it certainly never reaches the intensity of the original film especially since it <UNK> out and changes one important plot point from the original i guess we have the pg 13 rating to thank for that br br on the plus side there's an impressive set design and some dark atmosphere unfortunately there's not much going on around it to save this remake from being sub par <UNK> performance is pretty mediocre too br br it's just another unimpressive remake br br 1 2 out of
<START> a frustrating documentary louis <UNK> son who saw his father only <UNK> during his childhood because he was a member of just one of the three separate families his father had created takes on the task of trying to learn more about his father through an exploration of his architecture and his life it sounds like a great idea for a documentary but it ends up flat and uninteresting br br sadly the basic problem is that <UNK> son <UNK> is not just one of the film's protagonists he is also director writer producer <UNK> and narrator <UNK> seems both too inexperienced and possibly too close to the material to function well in any of these roles further while he seems like a nice enough guy he doesn't have much screen presence so the fact that he is the only constant in the film becomes wearing br br <UNK> also comes across as an <UNK> and amateurish <UNK> there are several points where an <UNK> makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera cuts to a shot of <UNK> offering little more than a blank stare and a sort of <UNK> uh huh as if he's a little <UNK> that he's going to have to come up with something to say in response at times i felt embarrassed watching people who might have had truly interesting things to say about <UNK> or at least better things to do with their time seeming to realize that they were in the hands of an <UNK> who was going to rely on them to direct the conversation br br <UNK> role as both <UNK> and lost son seem to do more to hurt the film than help one senses that some of the <UNK> are a little reluctant to really open up about negative aspects of <UNK> personality and career presumably because it's not clear from <UNK> whether he's looking to dig into the truth or simply wants to hear nice stories about his dad preferably ones that will confirm his hope that his dad really did care more for <UNK> and his mother than seems likely his passive approach as an <UNK> may <UNK> directly from this conflict the only person <UNK> does push is his own mother but those conversations tend to feel a little like bad teen drama aren't you angry mom and don't offer much in terms of helping us or <UNK> understand <UNK> or the loyalty he <UNK> from those around him br br what the film desperately lacks is <UNK> by an experienced and independent hand not to <UNK> <UNK> but to balance his <UNK> and <UNK> an independent director could have stood away from the material given more thought to what the <UNK> could contribute and one hopes cut out those portions of the documentary process that just don't work such as the weird segment with the guy who claims to have see <UNK> die which made it look as if <UNK> was just being taken in by some loony or the entire bit about <UNK> up with <UNK> first cousin who had nothing to add about <UNK> or <UNK> too many times <UNK> makes us watch him standing in or near a <UNK> building strangers to tell them that his father was the designer huh nice sir gotta go now i understand why these things might be important to <UNK> and that showing the documentary process is sometimes interesting but this is one of those examples of when a documentary can be too personal br br as an aside i thought the score written for the film was great but one of the <UNK> moments in the entire thing for me was when during the tour of the <UNK> art museum the voice over quotes <UNK> as making a comparison between architecture and <UNK> fifth <UNK> the music being played at the same time <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a mistake a <UNK> who knows it did make me laugh br br <UNK> was a great architect and it's clear that he was an unusual human being and had an intriguing life story there's definitely a good documentary to be made about him one is sympathetic to search for the father he didn't know but i'm not sure whether that is an interesting story neither works so well in this film
<START> i will never forget the utterly absorbing effect this show had on me when i saw it for the first time from the moment that the major is <UNK> by the clown to his <UNK> attempts to make sense of the situation we're alive we're people we must have memories quote but close to his clever attempt to <UNK> a means of escape this is riveting drama br br little touches stay with the viewer for a long time after watching it the moment when the lovely <UNK> dances for everyone to the off key <UNK> <UNK> of the scottish musician the <UNK> remark a miss is as good as a mile the <UNK> conclusion that they must be in hell br br this is a brilliant episode beautifully written and acted the breathtaking beauty of susan harrison adds to the of the strange touching story
<START> i think that never been <UNK> was a totally awesome movie the casting was really good and they acted very well i really like drew barrymore and of course for me it was excellent i was scared at first because it said that it wasn't coming out on video boy am i happy that it is because it's a beyond cool movie go see it if you already haven't
<START> zombie movies are hot i love 'em can't get enough why i would purchase a film of this caliber goes without explanation i just really love zombies surprise this really isn't much of a zombie movie low budget i can handle being <UNK> just <UNK> me br br a group of horror film clichés hold up in a warehouse lab who knows what to escape a fire storm outside panic yelling low light and eventually zombies ensue br br i kind of feel bad for the film makers as it is obvious that they really thought they were putting together something good a serious scary horror film it isn't far from it it's a boring mess of wooden acting cheesy fx poor lighting excessive dialogue and over editing br br things first go awry when it takes a good 10 minutes for the characters to ever sit down and start to figure out what is going on it gets worse when another 20 minutes go by and they are still sitting around trying to figure out what is going on all of this is <UNK> with non acting and bad dialogue br br finally some one gets attached not by a zombie though and hope <UNK> just a touch before the characters are again <UNK> around whining the only emotion any one every <UNK> about how much this sucks me too guys me too br br finally zombies are in the mix but no one watching cares any more i think there was some blood and gore tossed in but i was too busy praying for the credits to roll to notice and when the screen finally did fade to black i felt even more cheated by the <UNK> <UNK> inspired ending br br i will give credit for trying very hard even if it failed miserably that and the punk chick was very hot if totally under used br br can't really recommend this to anyone save for film students looking for <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br 4 10
<START> this film stinks more than <UNK> cheese if you find this at a garage sale leave it there i love sandra <UNK> and yet hate this movie although ashamed i do own a copy and the studio has changed the cover to play on the fact that sandra <UNK> is in this at all they play it up to be a sandra <UNK> movie she only has a small part in the whole movie and she does her best with that but she is young and had not learned her talent yet well everyone has to start somewhere
<START> i enjoyed the muppet movie very much it was the first of the muppet movies and is by far the best because it's so creative and fresh with later films the ideas just didn't seem quite so original but here we get to see <UNK> and miss <UNK> riding <UNK> an incredibly difficult scene an excellent ensemble cast and just a lot of fun i loved every minute the muppets were performing and i would have rated the film a lot higher except for one serious problem in this and most subsequent muppet films some powers that be felt there was a need to include lots of non muppets in particular many many cameos by stars some worked fine such as charles but many just seemed irrelevant and <UNK> the picture to a <UNK> halt probably the worst of them was with edgar <UNK> yes he was an amazing man who inspired jim <UNK> and the rest of his crew but the tiny scene he's in just wasn't needed nor were most of the cameos still despite this big complaint it's a great film for the entire family from the kids to even the most demanding adults
<START> this adaptation for tv was a wonderful vehicle for bill irwin to show his ability to perform physical humor with the backdrop of a struggle between an actor and his writer director bill uses his <UNK> antics to showcase a variety of skills including hat tricks <UNK> dance and various physical devices br br although it takes a big <UNK> at the entertainment industry and his craft it is engrossing for people of all walks and ages br br this work was <UNK> as a <UNK> special bill performed a piece of it on the tonight show but out of context it did not go over well
<START> when i saw gone with the wind i thought that there could not be better actors than vivian leigh and clark gable to play scarlett and <UNK> but then i saw the movie scarlet i fell in love for this dramatic story i love timothy dalton as <UNK> butler he's fantastic this is a movie i could watch a thousand times and it still wouldn't bore me
<START> i'd have to agree with the previous reviewer this film has awesome animation but has problems throughout the rest of the movie br br plot holes are huge dialog barely explains the concepts of the plot the main plot points aren't even fully explained until the last five minutes of the film the characters state the obvious while failing to explain the more confusing points of the film there are characters that pop up and have importance in the storyline that are never explained most of them have names that are only mentioned once and it is exceedingly confusing to a viewer br br don't waste your time with this movie unless you are in it for a good laugh and how dumb it is
<START> a gem from japan where so many of the world's best films are being made today <UNK> this isn't anything all that special it's just a simple drama with some comic overtones about recognizable people going about their lives <UNK> <UNK> best known for <UNK> the character lady in princess <UNK> plays a 50 year old <UNK> she's takes pride in her health spending each morning in a <UNK> <UNK> as she delivers milk up and down the <UNK> hills of <UNK> after she is done with this part time job she works her regular job as a clerk at a <UNK> store called s mart which made this army of darkness fan giggle along her milk route lives a 50 year old man whose wife is dying it turns out the milk woman and the man a child services worker dated in high school and each apparently still have something of a crush on the other the film actually has some major narrative problems when the screenwriter actually wants the two <UNK> lovers to <UNK> he uses a pretty unbelievable <UNK> ex <UNK> technique the climactic sequence is also really forced but most of the film is beautifully small and <UNK> of the two main characters as well as many side characters the film also has several subplots that seem like they will eventually <UNK> the film down but never end up doing so i think the best thing in the film is heartbreaking performance as the lonely milk woman who has <UNK> herself to being alone for the rest of her life whatever the problems were the film mostly <UNK> them
<START> i just wanted to write a quick response to all those people who give this film a bad review because they think it isn't funny or that it's boring br br here's the trick the film is not meant to be just a comedy it's got some depth to it like many <UNK> films it deals with people living in some of the odd <UNK> of our society who are trying to work out how to put together a fulfilling life for themselves br br unfortunately the movie and home video <UNK> don't deal well with subtlety and drop this in the comedy bin it is funny but a lot of the humor is off beat however the heart of the movie is not about the humor but about the people in it br br it may not be one of the greatest films in the world but it is solid and entertaining br br and the cast is one of those that shows why casting is an art <UNK> itself michelle <UNK> is great and this may be the film that showed she had some acting chops to add to her beauty <UNK> <UNK> is a big hoot and gets to chew the scenery in the way only she can in a role which requires it throw in oliver <UNK> joan cusack in smaller roles and the talented dean <UNK> and even chris and you've got a great cast throughout which here as usual makes a great difference br br matthew <UNK> is fun but more important he's a major <UNK> in this movie hot cute and sexy br br sit back expect the unexpected and let the movie take you where it wants to go and you should have a great time
<START> there is a need for this kind of entertainment in our modern world you can watch ma and <UNK> with adults with your family kids any age or just by yourself like me they are gentle but gentle is so refreshing in a society of kids killing kids a horrible war inappropriate prime time television and poverty we don't even get a hint of where all of those children came from give me modern <UNK> and i'll gladly become a <UNK> humor does not require offensive language it is hard to follow conversations in shows where every other word is relax take your shoes off and climb in your with a good old fashioned glass of <UNK> and just breathe easy watching ma sweeping the <UNK> off the table at lunch time <UNK>
<START> <UNK> is ostensibly a murder mystery but what <UNK> it from other similar movies of the period is the killer's motive which is anti <UNK> the story highlights examples of the kind of ignorance which <UNK> <UNK> and contains references to a <UNK> and an irish immigrant who also suffered <UNK> because of their <UNK> br br the movie's plot is based on richard <UNK> novel called the brick <UNK> which is about a hate crime where the victim was gay it's ironic that this story about a form of <UNK> should be met with <UNK> by the censors who that for the screen version the type of <UNK> involved should be changed to anti <UNK> another irony is the behaviour of a soldier who seems <UNK> proud of having served in a war against the nazis and yet <UNK> their hatred of jews the director and producer of this movie also suffered another type of <UNK> when they were <UNK> after being called to appear before the house un american activities <UNK> all these points just seem to <UNK> the deeply <UNK> and nature of the whole problem of <UNK> as depicted in this movie br br when police captain <UNK> robert young <UNK> the murder of joseph sam <UNK> he discovers that on the night when he was killed had been with a group of soldiers and one of these <UNK> arthur mitch mitchell george cooper is quickly identified as the prime suspect further information is also gathered from <UNK> robert ryan who is another of the soldiers who was present that night and sergeant robert mitchum who's a friend of mitchell with the help of some other soldiers then <UNK> for mitchell and when he finds him hears his account of what he did on the night of the murder including his meeting with a dance hall <UNK> called <UNK> <UNK> gloria <UNK> br br helps <UNK> to avoid being arrested and tries to identify the murderer <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> but her information is <UNK> to prove <UNK> innocence but <UNK> <UNK> lead him to <UNK> the motive for the crime and subsequently he sets up an elaborate trap which leads the real <UNK> into exposing his own guilt br br <UNK> is a movie with a message and the identity of the murderer is revealed at a very early stage in the story the message is conveyed in a way which was no doubt appropriate for the period in which it was made but by today's standards seems rather heavy handed the cinematography by j roy hunt is just wonderful with low key lighting and creative use of numerous <UNK> placed table <UNK> combining to evoke a look which is perfectly <UNK> with the drama being played out on screen br br despite it being a low budget production <UNK> was a great box office success and <UNK> from having an absorbing and very relevant story with a marvellous cast two of whom were nominated for academy awards for best supporting actor robert ryan and best supporting actress gloria <UNK> the additional nominations for edward best director producer adrian scott best picture and john paxton best writing adapted screenplay are just further evidence of the positive recognition which this movie <UNK> received
<START> even if it won't give one more than previous <UNK> here like ruby <UNK> very good one i wanted to share my own point of view hope my english is understandable br br bon voyage is a <UNK> light but deep presentation of the french <UNK> come down but also courage and charm all along in a brilliantly <UNK> 1940 france with many details from <UNK> <UNK> hotel occupied by government <UNK> and attacked by useless high class french to <UNK> <UNK> near le <UNK> <UNK> and 1930s cars <UNK> depardieu and <UNK> <UNK> give their second roles a brilliant taste isabelle <UNK> and <UNK> are very credible in their drastically different roles and makes an <UNK> performance br br much lighter than average e g american war times movies and focused on the civilians bon voyage shows a lot of things about french issues even to a french guy like me some of them quite deep
<START> i think it was a pretty good film it shows how someone grew up in an environment that created a rich and powerful man but unfortunately because of his ambition and the people around him it led to his destruction it shows that you can't trust anyone especially in a world that deals with a lot of money and envy the character that i mostly liked was she was another ambitious powerful and ruthless woman in a man's world who loved and respected <UNK> she also knew that business was business and a dangerous one everything she did was <UNK> but got the job done she helped <UNK> become rich with her connections overall i really liked this film and have it in my collection and waiting for el <UNK> 2
<START> this is possibly the worst movie i've ever seen it was horribly done it didn't flow it was very choppy because of that many people didn't understand the movie at all i had to watch this movie several times before i got an idea about what was happening ok its like this a kid stole <UNK> car and while running from the police he <UNK> it for some reason the cops let him off and he has to face his parents who sent him to live with his uncle out in the wilderness there he meets a girl who loves to rock climb and he gets into the sport and has to beg his uncle to let him enter a contest for climbing and yeah thats about it like i said horrible movie
<START> i was a huge fan of the original <UNK> br br but to say i was disappointed by this first sequel would be an understatement br br the problems are many br br glossy though the film may look there are plenty of <UNK> on screen for all to see <UNK> <UNK> etc something i find wholly <UNK> from someone of <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> has become a robot there is no spark of humanity to be found in the character here a true disappointment when one considers that his soul had returned by the end of the first movie here his attitude shows no human side and makes him hard to <UNK> with br br caine is a poor villain ok i know from the first film was better than the average mainly thanks to <UNK> smith's performance but the usually solid tom <UNK> creates a character who you couldn't care less about one way or the other br br what's happened to the old man i appreciate that he didn't get to where he is by being nice but the change in his character here is nothing short of <UNK> in the first movie it's made clear he <UNK> dick <UNK> tactics and attitude and yet here he's no better than jones it makes no sense br br doctor is a poor replacement for bob <UNK> charismatic if unpleasant resident genius br br the action sequences save the sequence where murphy is stuck to the side of <UNK> truck are harsh and nasty and <UNK> rather than entertain br br and finally what is with the musical score don't tell me couldn't have done it simply because he was working on total recall at the time a series tv or movie soundtrack is part of its personality part of its character when you remove that it <UNK> the <UNK> of the characters we're watching so it's bad enough but shame on leonard <UNK> his score here is lurid camp and downright cringe worthy br br the story has its moments to be fair there's a lot of originality in here but it tries too many new things to take in with one film <UNK> is a well realised villain and the only truly <UNK> likable <UNK> in the move thumbs up to gabriel damon there br br the final showdown between <UNK> and <UNK> 2 is fun as well br br but for the vast majority of its overlong running time this is a serious disappointment
<START> i usually steer clear of film festivals and don't enjoy slap stick comedy but i must say that this picture was great i immediately recognized david from the tv show numbers and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> arquette and karen black were at their usual best this is comedy at an incredibly high level with visual spoken and satirical <UNK> that kept the audience and me laughing throughout a rather deep <UNK> plot br br kudos to mr for dealing with a delicate but real subject in a manner that can be enjoyed but fully absorbed by his audience at every level of intellect the plot stays intact throughout the film and the comedic relief adds to the message without being laid on so thick as to <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> is done beautifully and the overall product is wonderfully <UNK> br br i can definitely state that this film is one that will go a long way and should be seen by audiences of all ages the problem is real and so is the powerful impact of this production
<START> strangers with candy overacts in all the wrong context the situations are just not funny with the cheesy voices and bad low brow comedy timing the clear attempt at dry black dark humour is obvious and it fails to deliver on all elements of a good joke br br with a high cringe factor and low laugh ratio i was shocked this show went pass the first season i personally like <UNK> the office 30 rock trailer park boys pulling <UNK> show simpsons family guy and i know what your thinking these shows aren't weird at all so some other good shows i've seen are jam <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the book group asylum and snuff box which are original with dry black dark humour satire and are all at least 5 10 br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> especially is cheap looking <UNK> and weird however the context is thought out and works to make it really out there and entertaining too
<START> this is a <UNK> example of how hollywood didn't doesn't trust <UNK> and <UNK> to its big name stars the character of christian is completely re written the anti <UNK> <UNK> faces from his own army unit is virtually eliminated michael's story is changed significantly and the end result is to <UNK> the power and terrible beauty of the book i almost wish i hadn't even seen it because of the ability of movies sounds and images to <UNK> so <UNK> in your brain i would have much rather just been left with the impression of the book the book could have been written today it is that honest and brave the movie neither my advice skip the movie read the book
<START> an excellent story well told by the film maker the interactions between the man and the <UNK> brought many questions to the viewers mind about just who was being <UNK> the humans killed for no reason the animals only to survive at the end of the movie you were left wondering just who the real hero of the movie was a well told story the human actor did an excellent job but the <UNK> stole every scene it was in
<START> this is without a doubt the most poorly thought out movie in history the invention gags by <UNK> top are some of the most awful attempts to be funny in recorded history i am not familiar with his other work but if it is half as bad as this then i am just going to cry i give this movie 1 out of 30 billion stars and may god have mercy on the souls of those responsible
<START> i have read several reviews that ask the question why was this film made i myself found that question <UNK> in my mind as the hour and twenty minute feature seemed to drag near the middle only to give off the sensation that it was picking up steam at the end when in <UNK> it was doing nothing of the sort so why was this film made i think that is a great question for those watching <UNK> to ask themselves this reviewer is proud of director <UNK> <UNK> for giving us this powerful image of hope <UNK> and inspiration with this all male choir but i do not think that <UNK> did enough to bring a gripping story to the table let me pose this question to you do audience members need more in a documentary than just a straight forward story to maintain interest my answer is yes and this is where <UNK> failed <UNK> was a good documentary but it was far from great <UNK> did a horrible job with the story and dedication of the subjects it was great to hear the songs but over time those songs seemed dull overwhelming and a bit <UNK> from the opening scene where our men are singing their hearts out in a <UNK> snow i knew that i was hooked but as the film developed i lost interest why <UNK> never took us the audience members to the next level he kept the playing field level and ultimately hurt the overall tone of the film was this a movie about the music or about the men in the choir the world may never know br br again i would like to state that <UNK> did a phenomenal job of finding an interesting story about this group of men who have definitely seen hard times and how they <UNK> with that through music but it was as if the all male choir were a bunch of the most boring men ever created <UNK> gave us the music superbly but it was the characters the subjects that i knew nothing about by the end of the film in the mix we had a <UNK> year old man who still had his <UNK> license we had a large man in a <UNK> singing classic american songs we had old men who were once <UNK> in their youth we had some tension between the youth of the choir and the veteran singers and we even had an ex drug addict that had only been clean for eleven years did <UNK> develop these interesting stories at all nope he left them on the table it was obvious that these singers were willing to talk further about it see the political man who missed his political days but <UNK> seemed to clear away from those heartfelt moments and head straight back into interesting places that he could have the choir sing to me the music was defined at the beginning of the film i wanted to be introduced and hear the stories of these individual men they were all captivating yet <UNK> seemed to ignore them completely br br by ignoring the major subjects of this documentary <UNK> became <UNK> in creating any sort of tension towards the end without giving the ending away i felt like <UNK> was <UNK> in the lines instead of being bold outside the lines he chose to create no moment of sympathy emotion <UNK> or sadness <UNK> took our subjects from point a to point b to point c without asking us to become involved in any way shape or form i can see how national sentiment had made this film into a huge success in <UNK> but for everyone else watching i e me more was necessarily needed i wanted to feel for these guys i wanted to know if they were going to do well as they traveled or just find themselves loved in their own city there was no story mostly in part to no development of the subjects when you watch modern documentaries oddly this film was made in 2001 you want it to play out similar to any hollywood feature film you want suspense realism and drama alas with <UNK> you get nothing of the sort br br overall i must ask the question again why was this film made my final answer alex is that <UNK> wanted to show how <UNK> times and a changing economy can still produce happiness in even the <UNK> places of earth i think that <UNK> wanted to show human dedication and how something as simple as singing can <UNK> a population with that said <UNK> demonstrated that perfectly in this film but he did not create a good documentary when you make a film of this nature i feel that you must look within the group examine the choir participants and hear each one of their stories to bring about an ending that will grip your heart the only thing that this film <UNK> was my attention span as it attempted to leave the room at rocket speed again i do not want to sound negative about this film because the music was excellent and the men singing did bring about a feeling of honesty but i needed more with documentaries becoming a bigger <UNK> of the film community one expects a bit more than what <UNK> handed to us i want to see reality and people not just another song and dance routine br br grade out of
<START> this is an excellent anime movie it is well animated has a good intricate plot and very good music i understand that some may think of it as a little long but i think that it is a good length and the animation is good traditional anime br br three characters br br the way they use is <UNK> for example the body double showing up at all these locations adds to the ominous tone of the movie the design of is good too the way he looks as a monk and in the end scene the <UNK> he is wearing br br the old man is down to earth and a very likable character when meets him it's a turning point in the movie br br the <UNK> who <UNK> clan saves life twice he stays in the background most of the movie though but he is really one of the heroes of the movie br br the plot the plot is good it is traditional without being unoriginal the historical time it is acted out in is interesting the <UNK> <UNK> the treasure is sought after by to <UNK> the <UNK> while when finds it he uses it to help the anti <UNK> forces <UNK> the <UNK> br br the way tricks is interesting and has sort of a hamlet feel to it there is also a sweet irony to the fact that if had not gotten to become a <UNK> i don't think that he had been able to kill him in the end maybe by <UNK> but not hand to hand combat weapons br br the plot with all the death makes it mostly very dark but there's some light moments when we see some of childhood memories all in all it's a good dark intricate plot br br the music the opening theme for example is very good with the electric guitar and drums they occasionally in that piece use what i believe to be drums but i'm not sure br br there is a lot of good music like the one played while they are traveling to the <UNK> i believe the piece is called and has an incredible <UNK> in it the <UNK> might be a pan <UNK> but more probably a br br the end theme no is calm and delicate the <UNK> are beautiful and so is the song in general br br the animation br br the animation while good is not perfect and the blood that runs down the characters do sometimes appear to be orange the transitions are interesting and i think some transitions are very nice one example of a nice transition is when and the <UNK> are running there is the sunset in the background and the music is playing the transition is simple but effective and has a nice feeling too it br br my final words i think that the plot the animation the music and the characters make this into one of the best anime movies i have ever seen
<START> i walked out of this movie and i did this only one time before with the australian movie <UNK> close to 20 years ago after about three minutes i felt like killing the camera man and just couldn't believe that this film actually showed anywhere and guess what was nominated for two independent spirit awards what how realistic the dialog might be i will never use the word dude again who wants to listen to these conversations i don't go to the movies to be annoyed but that's all i got the only good thing i came away with was the realization that if this movie can make it to sundance and other festivals anybody can well wait that might not be a good thing after all
<START> i saw this movie the day it opened in nyc at the <UNK> at the time madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now she had a couple of hits was very good in seeking susan and i had tickets to see her in concert at giants stadium br br who's that girl gives madonna an actual role to play which is not just a variation of her own personality she does the <UNK> heroine routine better than you might think <UNK> dunne is very well cast as the man around to witness all the <UNK> br br the story involves a huge cat named murray a bride to be who has slept with every <UNK> in nyc a mean father in law and a key there are a lot of car chases and cops <UNK> their path all the elements of a screwball comedy intact br br sir john mills is seen briefly he shares a glass of <UNK> with the leads and has the greatest apartment on the upper west side complete with a rain forest and everything br br compared to most madonna movies the ones i've been able to tolerate anyway this is fantastic on its own its not that bad 6 10 br br ps the concert was lousy
<START> afraid of the dark left me with the impression that several different screenplays were written all too short for a feature length film then spliced together clumsily into this <UNK> monster br br at his best the protagonist lucas is creepy as hard as it is to draw a <UNK> on the secondary characters they're far more sympathetic br br afraid of the dark could have achieved mediocrity had it taken just one approach and seen it through and had it made lucas simply psychotic and confused instead of <UNK> and off putting i wanted to see him packed off into an asylum so the rest of the characters could have a normal life
<START> okay some other people have commented that this isn't an action flick so i don't need to rehash that even though i just did this isn't exactly a let down in fact it's nice on occasion to see an actor try something different but unfortunately this isn't one of those occasions br br now the story non existent this film lacks in storyline almost as much as did sure they throw in a couple <UNK> no not even <UNK> something else <UNK> here and there to please seagal being that that's what he's into this doesn't make a story not even close now the ending even those amongst us who actually liked this film the ending you have to admit it was a bit much or a lot stupid br br now from what i understand this was a direct to video film at least in the states but this is even too good for this one this piece of garbage should have been cable only on <UNK> or <UNK> late night
<START> br br won't be long on this movie the first half an hour was one of the most boring i have had to face since i've started watching movies the story didn't advanced nothing was explained about any of the characters it felt like a non movie a lot of people had already left the audience at this point br br a lot of the scene were totally <UNK> and unexplained br br the director should have studied film a bit more to know that each sequence each scene has to make the story go forward he never did that br br the supposedly funny moments were contrived and only a few people laughed people with a weird sense of humor i guess br br prize of the jury in cannes 2002 don't know what the jury was thinking about probably the correct effect br br i would have loved to love it the disappointment was therefore even bigger br br you have to see it to believe it but wait for the video
<START> well i've watched this movie for over 25 years now and it's still almost as interesting as when i first saw it it is definitely one of the most unique films ever made br br i still think martin sheen got <UNK> big time in the billing too he <UNK> the film yet gets lesser billing than marlon brando who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2 hours 17 minutes film theatrical version how unfair is that br br sheen is fantastic in here especially his narration which runs throughout it's one of the best <UNK> if not the best i have ever heard in a movie his voice is just haunting as he relates his thoughts on this incredible nightmare like adventure i never fail to appreciate his work in this movie br br the other thing that strikes me about the film over the years are the number of memorable scenes ones i have never forgotten such as br br sheen losing it in his hotel room in the movie's first scene robert duvall and the totally out of place surfing scenes and then the ensuing attack with <UNK> dramatic classical music <UNK> out of the <UNK> the playboy bunny entertaining the troops <UNK> forrest being freaked out seeing a tiger close up in the jungle the weird scenes on the long <UNK> ride the appearance of hippie journalist dennis hopper <UNK> the crew in cambodia and then <UNK> bizarre character it goes on and on with strange scenes br br that's not to say i enjoyed everything no there are a few very unpleasant scenes such as the one in which an <UNK> is <UNK> in half can't watch that anymore an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by <UNK> young stoned out crew and the crew is a little too goofy at times then there is the huge amount of profanity led by way too many f words br br so there is a lot of good and a lot of bad things in this movie for almost anyone who watches this one thing for sure it is a film you will remember
<START> i didn't have much high hopes for this one before seeing it the story <UNK> stereotype at me br br i mean come on it's so stupid the plot line about the innocent <UNK> that realizes that the people who created him are <UNK> then decides to change everything br br i had to see it three times the first two times i fell asleep because i was so incredibly bored by it it's very rare that movies bore me so much i fall asleep during them the third time i forced myself to watch it simply to be able to warn people about it br br i got the distinct impression that the people responsible for this mess had tried to take all the cool neat things from other scifi action movies and put them together to make a kick ass movie they took the <UNK> robot lots of action thin story stereotype characters and a big fight in the end and threw it together unfortunately the movie sucks the acting is so wooden you could build a house out of it the storyline plot is absolutely laughable the <UNK> and editing is horrid the direction is non existent and to top it all off everything is so cliche and ridiculous that it just <UNK> the hell out of you br br i was left with the feeling that i could've spent the time watching this one doing something much more creative like <UNK> my <UNK> or watching the grass grow
<START> a powerful real tv movie very <UNK> and therefore remaining almost un <UNK> almost <UNK> 2 <UNK> in france after you've watched this <UNK> all movies filmed with the same concept a documentary team following the events as they arrived seem so weak br br david
<START> this movie is a shameful result of what happens when br br a it is written directed and produced by an idiot and or b it was rushed in production to <UNK> the poker <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br the story from beginning is uneven spends too much time on childhood and not enough on some of the legendary tales such as counting cards his <UNK> <UNK> the roll of money as id he also leaves out mentions of other poker <UNK> such as chip reese etc the movie is a complete mess from beginning to end br br if you want a more complete and accurate account read the book one of a kind if you thought the movie was good read the book and change your mind
<START> two horse <UNK> arrive in a town and meet up with the leader of a group of <UNK> who are bound for a valley where they can settle and live in peace the scenes of the <UNK> in the town where ward bond and ben johnson <UNK> <UNK> and bond introduces the idea of them johnson and his partner played by harry carey jr leading the train to this valley are some of the best in the film as johnson a real cowboy a piece of wood while he <UNK> with bond once on the trail they come upon <UNK> <UNK> who maybe john ford saw in red river and offered her a much better part in this film in the <UNK> train are a number of notable characters the are a group who are challenged along the way by a truly <UNK> group of <UNK> in their case the <UNK> in the case of the people on the train and later a band of <UNK> whom they encounter and in the well written characters played by ben johnson and ward bond the film completely <UNK> stereotypes while the camera seems to spend as much time giving the viewer the big picture of <UNK> valley framing the train as it moves along with a few water <UNK> along the way in stunning black and white and then coming back to what's happening in this rolling community all to the <UNK> of the beautiful of the sons of the <UNK>
<START> if a copy of this movie fell into the wrong hands the world would be in grave danger i am a huge fan of b movies and i have seen my share of bad ones but there is not a letter in the <UNK> that could adequately describe this <UNK> piece of <UNK> <UNK> this movie even surpasses the so bad it's good phase and goes straight on to the so bad your world will seem a little less meaningful for having watched it phase br br it is hard to say what is more disturbing 1 the fact that the people who wrote this thought their political satire i use the term very very very loosely was witty enough to film 2 they were able to find so many other people who agreed with them enough to work on this garbage for obviously little or no money 3 that someone actually thought it would be a good idea to pick this crap up for distribution on a horror anthology dvd br br were i a weaker man i most likely would have <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> into my eyes and then <UNK> <UNK> myself to my death in <UNK> traffic after watching this as it stands though i live but i am forever <UNK> by the experience
<START> well i read the other comments didn't think it sounded any good but decided to tape it anyway perhaps not so smart to read all the poor reviews before watching this movie because of course i would be <UNK> all the same weird things excessive use of fade to black a few weird camera angles and <UNK> dialog for different conversations with the same people taking place at different times but <UNK> all that i thought to myself well this would probably be really boring if it was all going <UNK> the conversations aren't that exciting but kind of mandatory and the constant <UNK> to black after really short scenes really makes it feel like the story is fast <UNK> too the interesting part skipping the boring bits at the end of the movie it gets a bit exciting too will they survive br br so i actually liked this movie no not really the director had some interesting ideas on how to keep the audience from being bored while he is trying to introduce the characters but he is <UNK> it it gets annoying and sometimes confusing this was apparently only the second movie he directed so maybe he will learn and make really good stuff in the future and if you're sitting there in the future reading this wondering if the now famous directors second movie is worth a watch well if he is good in the future sure watch this crap and wonder how he ever got to make a third one otherwise this movie isn't really worth watching unless you very interested in film making and want to see one way you can cut the mandatory boring <UNK> scenes into something watchable
<START> the case history of <UNK> dr ' is known what should had been another <UNK> after <UNK> into the <UNK> field of tv series ended up abruptly after <UNK> the pilot it was too <UNK> and twisted for the producers to venture an investment lynch used all the filmed and cut material and started new shootings to finish a completely new feature film the result one of the most impressive cinema experiences of this decade which can be <UNK> among the best works of david lynch his earlier movies <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> at <UNK> kept <UNK> in an irritating way which <UNK> the viewer into the role of a <UNK> but never involved him as part of the plot happening such as here br br <UNK> dr ' is a puzzle where pieces are missing others obviously were taken from and <UNK> <UNK> but it never seemed to be unfinished work in the internet i came across with a lot of <UNK> and <UNK> to explain this film i am aware now that it loses its magic when you try to <UNK> it completely all those detailed solution explanations are not only waste but also the questionable attempt to offer an answer where no such thing is completely required imagine this scenario a little child is <UNK> his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of that bear lies is it because it wants to destroy his toy does the secret lie in the teddy bear or actually in the heart of the child <UNK> this to <UNK> dr ' it means innocence is one of the most important conditions to watch and appreciate it br br david lynch succeeds not only to picture the surface of human behavior life but also to <UNK> with everything beneath that human desires dreams <UNK> and fears all that what remains <UNK> emotions that are often repressed <UNK> dr ' has the intensity calling for a cast that completely takes issue with the substance actresses and actors who are ready to follow the visions of the director <UNK> laura <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> justin <UNK> solve their task in such an <UNK> way that you wouldn't want or couldn't imagine another cast while their acting at the beginning seems to be a little <UNK> you soon will realize that this <UNK> <UNK> is set in with a purpose to manipulate the viewer and to <UNK> him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible br br when you claim the <UNK> of a well made film in being able to lose yourself and dive into what you see on screen than lynch succeeded in making a masterpiece a modern masterpiece that <UNK> david lynch's status as one of the most important creative and courageous directors of the present like every film maker who go beyond the limits he is confronted with criticism and ignorance this will fade as soon as you find the individual key to lynch's world of films <UNK> dr ' is more than just a sleeper  it is a must see for everyone who loves ambitious cinema and besides the film is a pay off with hollywood in form and content which in that was hardly <UNK> before
<START> tarzan the <UNK> awareness leader faces four who by most <UNK> means <UNK> animals to get them to <UNK> tarzan has a bland but sexy enough wife with an impeccable <UNK> and a kid no one should fault tarzan for being <UNK> by the vicious actions of the hunters br br this gordon scott tarzan flick is one of the <UNK> completely and unnecessarily silly for one reason or another the team did not find anything charming to sustain the movie and so it's just some silly rubbish tarzan and his family are threatened by a group of evil because <UNK> <UNK> awareness brought him into open conflict with the <UNK> the kid and the <UNK> both <UNK> to tarzan are kidnapped by the <UNK> so tarzan <UNK> the unleashed animal forces of the jungle to release the kid and the tarzan leading the attack tarzan and the is silly unappealing quite uninteresting maybe as a kid i would have liked it now one has to be too <UNK> mean as those pathetic <UNK> by ask a tarzan flick not to be silly this i <UNK> but one is also truly entitled to ask these tarzan flicks however silly to have and to show some bit of a tiny bit of gusto some kick some excitement some fun now the gordon scott tarzan failure is too silly exactly in the sense of not having any gusto at all of lacking all excitement yes i liked the sequence of the jungle beast eating a snake what beast watch the movie <UNK> now here i just gave you one excuse to do so for one reason or another the villains look somewhat pathetic and <UNK> mercy rather than <UNK> anger br br the books leave the impression that tarzan seemed quite bright in his own way and if finding a decent <UNK> or another <UNK> to look clever enough for the role might prove a too demanding next to impossible task gordon scott was anyway too far from meeting that ideal br br the wife <UNK> tarzan for <UNK> books br br the script suggests tarzan was <UNK> almost illiterate and <UNK> to learning but the book says otherwise and we know that tarzan studied much by himself using the books of his gone family before even meeting white people br br and i did not like that yell br br it's supposed dear <UNK> to be a genuine wild yell not a missed
<START> i'm actually too <UNK> to write this review bad movies always do that to me but i feel <UNK> as if it's my <UNK> duty to warn anyone who might be considering <UNK> or viewing this god awful mess of a picture please please just take my word this is one you'll want to stay away from it's so boring and dull so insipid and uninspired such a poor excuse to <UNK> any familiar talent burt reynolds wasted despite his best efforts ice t is barely in the film and when he does appear on screen his performance is so restrained and muted that it becomes crystal clear that the director perhaps <UNK> by <UNK> intense stare didn't know what to do with him rob lowe as the title character has never displayed so little on screen charisma mario van <UNK> should be ashamed of himself his performance is in the saddest sense possible a joke surely satan himself signed <UNK> check for this film the plot is as weak half baked and annoying as all the music involved the utterly boring club song seems to continue on literally for the first third of the movie the film's look will <UNK> one to seriously wonder if the director of photography was also forced like one of the film's forgettable female characters to smoke crack from a <UNK> <UNK> taped to his mouth and if you're looking at least for stylized shoot 'em up type violence you'll get none here this film i assure you i promise you has absolutely no redeeming qualities please i <UNK> you avoid this flick don't put it in and get <UNK> into believing that its pace will pick up it'll get better and <UNK> into a decent denouement it won't it don't it can't it sucks now you have been warned and i can now go to bed it's <UNK> please forgive any resulting errors this <UNK> might contain knowing my conscience is clear because i've done my <UNK> duty for my fellow man
<START> took a chance to see if perhaps a really good wwi film had slipped my notice this isn't it john phillip law and don <UNK> are both stiff in their acting and miscast for their roles the dialogue is dumb or non existent the flying sequences are okay but pretty repetitive compared to the terrific blue max this movie should never have been made watch george <UNK> james mason and <UNK> in the and you get why that movie is one of the best war films ever made and this isn't recently released on dvd and brown is presented as some great <UNK> <UNK> from the 70's i <UNK> mine the day after i bought it don't waste your time or
<START> this was a get up and go horror movie with an intelligent cast and a director with great vision to really capture the mood of the story i highly recommend this movie
<START> i am not a fan of musicals but i am a huge fan of jean <UNK> and jean <UNK> i rented this movie on a <UNK> and was pleasantly surprised even expecting greatness from the classic director this movie is beautiful the shots are like oil paintings with motion something a lot of directors <UNK> for but <UNK> masters i cannot express how much this movie <UNK> itself it's not really a musical it just has a couple of well placed musical numbers and a grand dancing finale but there is something about this movie in particular which makes you feel absolute joy when watching it br br i am a fan of foreign art films but i'm also a <UNK> who loves things like die hard and <UNK> movies i get very easily turned off by things that are overly happy or in la la land but this movie has an overwhelming positive energy that is just irresistible not to mention every frame is gorgeous and the plot is good 10 out of 10
<START> this one of the best and funniest comedy series i have ever seen all characters are brilliant br br mr david <UNK> is a very very irritated man irritated by everything and anyone br br he wants to do things and handle situations as best as he possibly can but he never gets it right and only gets himself deeper and deeper in trouble not supported by his wife janet who only tries to get him deeper and deeper into the trouble he is getting himself into and really does not need the help at all br br all characters are played portrayed brilliantly just imagine sending your kid s to a school like this br br it is unbelievable that people do not like it maybe some don not get the many many plays on words that are featured many times per episode br br it is also unbelievable that there is still no dvd release of it there are only 2 series br br so please release it let it go so the fans can and will enjoy it br br try it you might just like it br br just some names words from the series man helmet hot bitch <UNK> <UNK> travis <UNK> and many many more
<START> i wouldn't be so sure to accept the <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> evidence against anna anderson first read peter book on which this film is based anna anderson knew things that only the real grand <UNK> <UNK> could possibly have known <UNK> evidence in <UNK> favor aside second compare the pictures of <UNK> and anna anderson anyone can see that they are one and the same person third visit peter website <UNK> below where you can read detailed information about the <UNK> <UNK> as well as why <UNK> and anna anderson are not the same person <UNK> down to the link anna <UNK> notes on <UNK> even relatives believed that their sister and anna anderson were not the same person br br i for one will always believe that <UNK> and anna anderson were indeed the same person i will never be <UNK> to the contrary br br www com
<START> most critics have written devastating about that movie but i wanted it to see myself and unfortunately they are right the film had the greatest budget ever in russian movie history two international stars colorful mass scenes apparently shot quite close to the <UNK> but in the end it appears to be a nice sweet nothing you would not believe that this director earlier has made masterpieces like and burnt by the sun the characters in the storyline are not convincing neither jane nor nor <UNK> only general worth being mentioned it remains on the surface all the time politically it is to me a <UNK> of the army and especially the russian one with values like honor and duty and having lived at least half a year in <UNK> my russia is much more than the one that is depicted in movie regarding burnt by the sun by the same director as a no question 10 points movie one of the best i ever seen in my entire life i was totally disappointed by that one sorry nevertheless unique talent in delivering amazingly beautiful pictures is still there
<START> it is a damn good movie with some surprising twists a good cast and a great script only a couple of stupid bits like the <UNK> hit man scene this guy's a professional but that has been commented on already the fact i had only heard one guy at work mention it before and did not have many opinions or reviews to go on made it even more entertaining this gets a higher score than maybe some people think it deserves but i have to factor in the low budget and the good effort from the cast it <UNK> me that some movies get made whose budget equals the of a small country with a hyped up release good reviews an oscar winning director and or actors and turn out to be so disappointing with actors <UNK> through their roles and uninspired directing with predictable plot lines and a story with holes in it so big sandra <UNK> could drive a bomb loaded bus through it examples in my opinion are the <UNK> <UNK> matrix <UNK> extra points are awarded for the wardrobe department choosing great clothes for the cast especially who wears a rubber dress in one scene and a jacket with c <UNK> on the back in large letters in another a sex scene which shows off her tight ass and a good soundtrack are added <UNK> and please enough with the tarantino comparisons this did not remind me of a tarantino flick at all and tarantino borrows virtually every idea he has ever had from other movies even if that is your opinion are we saying once a certain film or book is written or directed one way no one can ever use the same ideas again get real this film has it's own style
<START> with actors like depardieu and richard it is really a hard task to make a dull movie but <UNK> is a master in setting a slow pace and making supposedly funny scenes without any wits and depth this movie is high on story but low on character you never get to know any of the characters except for superficial slapstick unfortunately <UNK> has no idea what slapstick is all about his style could be described at hit and miss of course some people laugh when they see someone slip on a banana <UNK> <UNK> directs his humor at this lot it is a shame how bad he uses good talent many good french comedians have been wasted away by mediocre directors
<START> to <UNK> my remarks on the film i know the topic is horrendous and words can't adequately express the compassion any decent person would have for people dealing with the post horrors of an atomic bomb dropped near them br br however this film doesn't really deal with in a horrific way except for the first 10 minutes some of the images there are horrifying and should be as a reminder what <UNK> nuclear weapons can produce seeing burned people walking around <UNK> or man <UNK> his hair and of hair coming out etc is not a pretty sight br br but after the first dozen minutes this japanese film concerns people dealing with the aftermath of <UNK> in the mid to late <UNK> i actually found the story developing quickly into a boring soap opera br br almost all the story occurs five years after the bomb and deals mainly with one family's problems at that point this is why it became more of a melodrama than some shocking story of nuclear disaster it's simply a story about how these people got on with their lives from about 1950 on whether one of the women was <UNK> damaged and if so should she marry br br this could have been a real impact film but it didn't go in that direction
<START> <UNK> is a hard hard movie to enjoy it's so slow and <UNK> in it's pacing that at times i was <UNK> off during the film this was about on a hot sunny day i might add not midnight on a cold winter evening so you get an idea of just how slow this movie is br br strange thing is it's not long at 100 minutes it's only ten minutes longer than the average straight to video and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the superior <UNK> that i'd quite happily watched the day before it just drags an awful lot enough for you to lose interest br br when it's not <UNK> s l o o w development for atmosphere <UNK> is good enough at action to almost make it <UNK> how slowly things happen while the flashbacks are both cheap and annoying as a way to round out <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> woman the <UNK> aliens whatever are actually quite creepy and effective especially when her <UNK> mother turns up and starts <UNK> in the night full marks for not make up all over the shop too the single person boat is a creepy place and at times the movie uses the full power of the location and the deserted sea to scare the hell out of you br br still though i find it hard to recommend <UNK> i came out of it not only feeling like i'd just watched a 4 hour film not a 100 minute one but also feeling like i'd been cheated somehow as while offering many explanations as to the <UNK> mind games real ghosts space aliens <UNK> doesn't pick one for definite all that watching <UNK> mitchell talk to her cat and dominic <UNK> for no obvious reason about some unexplained horrific event in the past for nothing say what you like about <UNK> but at least he tells you what happened however crazy stupid you might think it if you don't watch a lot of these movies your fresh perspective will probably improve matters somewhat but i found this slow boring and highly derivative if you want to scare yourself silly there are much better places to do it if you want a clever thriller there are many that are smarter
<START> it's sometimes difficult to watch such self <UNK> message films from an earlier seemingly simpler era without a certain degree of cynicism the issue of racism and religious tolerance is one that has been <UNK> into us from an early age and as we've grown teachers and authority figures have sought out less blatant yet equally effective means of getting the message across 'the house i live in 1945 ' is about as <UNK> as message films come and frank sinatra seems to be treating his audience like a child  indeed perhaps this was the point as the short was no doubt intended primarily to influence younger film goers even so i found myself curiously affected when sinatra launched into that sincere patriotic speech about what it really means to be an and i'm not even an american released just two months after the end of wwii director <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> war weary audiences with a message of tolerance <UNK> and above all else hope the music ain't bad either br br fresh faced frank sinatra  already a star but not yet the superstar he'd become  opens the film in a recording studio <UNK> out if you are but a dream with a full <UNK> <UNK> when between songs frank goes outside for a he <UNK> a large group of kids bullying a young jewish boy their <UNK> <UNK> purely by his <UNK> religion ol' blue eyes quickly puts a stop to this childish behaviour <UNK> <UNK> the bullies nazi werewolves and <UNK> their irrational prejudice he then <UNK> and good <UNK> the group on the plain silliness of racial and religious <UNK> <UNK> them that every american culture however it <UNK> from our own is still american at unless of course you're one of those bloody <UNK> there's a hint of <UNK> in <UNK> for racial tolerance while presenting one nation as the collective enemy though you could hardly blame hollywood for being less than enthusiastic about the plight of the japanese in 1945 br br sinatra drives his point home with a wonderfully heartwarming rendition of the house i live in which was written in 1943 by <UNK> when the <UNK> first heard the song on film he was furious that the filmmakers had completely <UNK> three of his <UNK> which he considered crucial to the message these <UNK> were most likely due to time <UNK> but understandably didn't take too kindly to them and reportedly had to be <UNK> from the cinema when it was first released 'the house i live <UNK> was deemed such an important short film that it won a golden globe for best film for promoting international good will and a <UNK> oscar for all involved in 2007 it was judged to be <UNK> historically or <UNK> significant and added to the library of national film <UNK> which is how i came to hear of it while its approach may seem a little hokey sixty years later this film remains quite watchable thanks to a young <UNK> named frank sinatra
<START> jaded offers a premise with potential as it looks at the rape of a woman by two other women and ask the question when is rape not rape unfortunately the flick seems to suffer from bad direction as it <UNK> through legal <UNK> while trying to <UNK> some kind of story with a handful of foul mouthed and poorly portrayed characters only to end abruptly jaded is lame stuff only for the <UNK> eyed couch <UNK> in the mood for some dark drama
<START> la <UNK> is a pretty funny south park episode <UNK> is at the toy store one day and here's a kid swearing out loud but not getting in trouble for it his mother then tells everyone that the kid has syndrome <UNK> loves the fact that he can swear without getting into trouble so he tells everybody that he has syndrome kyle however finds out that <UNK> is lying and tries to tell people but they think he is <UNK> and is put in a sensitivity training type place <UNK> eventually land him a spot on a talk show however he finds that he cannot control his and starts saying embarrassing things that happen to him meanwhile kyle tries to <UNK> the show in an interesting way
<START> magnificent original beautiful movie the acting is great the settings en <UNK> are superb paris at its best but then the real paris not the famous settings and the music will do also a brilliant very detailed which i just very much love br br the best french movie i've seen and french cinema is very good
<START> this was really the worst movie i've ever seen anyone who has seen it will know what i'm talking about i saw it on <UNK> so thank goodness i didn't waste my money please everyone don't waste your time i'm really <UNK> this wasn't straight to video
<START> alfred hitchcock made this comedy of <UNK> marriage in 1941 but his heart doesn't appear to be in it carole lombard and robert <UNK> are the couple who discover they were never <UNK> married and spend the movie <UNK> their way back to true love it doesn't have much of a reputation and it is easy to see why the jokes are familiar from better films but here they don't <UNK> and the leads are <UNK> <UNK> performance is <UNK> and <UNK> and it's <UNK> sad to think she was dead only a year later robert <UNK> seems to know he's in a <UNK> ear and tries his to make a <UNK> purse out of it without much success the best performance comes from gene raymond as 'the other man' he has a lovely drunk scene this is one of the few really bad hitchcock films
<START> spoilers edgar rice famous character was adapted thousand of times for the screen <UNK> one's <UNK> is <UNK> notably during the thirties and the forties by hollywood its made tarzan one of the most successful cinema characters several years later hugh hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the monkey man and it's a more natural more wild and more down to earth tarzan that he gives away here hudson <UNK> avoids the clichés that you usually grant to tarzan such as his famous scream or his friendly pet <UNK> not only are we far from the designed and invented character made by <UNK> but we are also far from the film set used to make his stories the movie was partly made in africa more precisely in <UNK> the movie introduces two obvious parts the first one which takes place in the jungle where tarzan lives among his <UNK> friends the apes and considers himself as their lord but he ignores his real origins the second one in england where tarzan discovers the english society ian <UNK> <UNK> the link between the two parts and hudson avoids all that could make the movie falls into the ridiculous thanks to a clever screenplay indeed <UNK> teaches <UNK> basic rules of manners so as to behave correctly in the english society and the result works moreover in the second part no one ever laughs at tarzan and he's even really appreciated as far as the end is concerned well it's a both bitter and happy end happy because tarzan comes back to the jungle and meets again his <UNK> close relatives but bitter too because this <UNK> means that the <UNK> line won't be <UNK> and is condemned to disappear <UNK> <UNK> finds here his first and last great role sadly he'll never equal the achievement of his performance in this movie and he'll play in poor and action movies nevertheless as i said previously a clever screenplay a performance of a rare quality some impressive natural <UNK> both the jungle and the english country and we get a gorgeous movie it's also an excellent from a popular novel so why is it only rated barely 6 10
<START> as many have detailed here with a level of seriousness that i find amusing this is not br br a film cue dramatic music br br it's just a so bad it's good totally surreal jackie chan stunt for all the women fighters are totally kick butt and jackie is definitely put in his place br br this is the movie you want to see with some good friends on a sunday afternoon surrounded by <UNK> ready to <UNK> with laughter cheer on the good guys boo the bad guys and continually yell what when something totally bizarre happens great fun
<START> this is easily my favourite film a tragic romance <UNK> with a complex mystery whose threads are all but invisible until they all unravel at the end in one fantastic rush sheer brilliance br br i'd love to see some more of <UNK> work but at least according to imdb he hasn't made any other features has the high quality of this work made producing another too <UNK> a task has he moved back into some other <UNK> of creative <UNK> i certainly hope this won't be his final feature but i can't really blame him if he decides to stop with this gem as his only contribution to the world of feature films
<START> this musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few the wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call <UNK> br br this music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises it is about a land far away from it all where living things have room to grow its people are living and growing together mentally and <UNK> faster than in <UNK> age br br the lyrics help us recognize the <UNK> of this world that is spinning around and to look inside yourself that is where the truth always lies the absolute level of consciousness is more real than the ever changing world of the senses br br i have been searching for the video for years when i find it or it comes out in dvd it will help share the joy of being in <UNK> la again burt music and hal david's lyrics made a masterpiece in <UNK> times that is just now ready to be fully appreciated br br may this cd inspire you to find your own lost horizon or recognize it when peace of mind has found you <UNK>
<START> if you want to have a great time then this is the movie to watch br br take the premise there is this college which admits people with minimum <UNK> of <UNK> b com m com ma <UNK> b e m tech and so you have to take into account the time consumed and thus it is obvious that all students are 40 also the school admits students of a <UNK> and has a course of p <UNK> in weight loss and the only student who failed this course is only she was a snake in the past life still not convinced ok read on br br here's a scene akshay kumar a college student is chased by and he takes out a <UNK> and shoots him then throws <UNK> then one of the <UNK> hits akshay but doesn't die and continues to fight the snake <UNK> a half foot <UNK> into akshay and <UNK> on it but akshay is still there then akshay gets on a jet <UNK> and follows they fight and <UNK> akshay underwater and finally akshay is dead so we think as soon as is out of the picture akshay <UNK> away to raj principal of this college boxing <UNK> professor <UNK> priest br br but no one i repeat no one takes the cake but a certain mr you watch to learn more
<START> i have never seen the tv series or the previous movies probably that's the reason why i didn't enjoy it much boring and just not funny sums it up nicely br br considering the budget the movie seemed to have it's embarrassing they couldn't do an even passable job br br we went to the cinema with no at all and the hope to see a somewhat funny movie that wouldn't be too <UNK> on the mind my friend fell asleep halfway through the movie and i spend the next 2 hours hoping that it would finally pick up a hope which died with the end credits
<START> i enjoyed the <UNK> and found the relationship between tucker and chan previously hilarious however was a re <UNK> of the first two without the charm or humor i think i may have laughed once and it was during the tucker was exceedingly annoying in this film and his character didn't seem to have any purpose other than to <UNK> everything up in the most irritating way possible chan is always likable but he seemed tired in this film i was able to predict everything who the villain was who the girl was spoiler alert who the good guy turned bad guy was etc i hope to see more movies from tucker and chan in their separate <UNK> but not in any more rush hour sequels it's just too tired i recommend a rental but not a purchase
<START> this is one of those strange self important self indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound it isn't instead it <UNK> cliches that try to pass for <UNK> typical is the scene where peter <UNK> explains to protagonist and best friend adam brown how man starts life breast feeding then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend and finally his wife thus <UNK> ultimately that life sucks so deep we are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life the universe etc during <UNK> travels through the <UNK> desert on foot he abruptly leaves l a the day of his wedding and his family friends and <UNK> assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test range <UNK> by a rocket some characters are more entertaining than others the best by far is an <UNK> from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others the actor james kevin ward does some great impressions including nicholson <UNK> and several characters from the original star trek but once the interesting characters leave the screen we're stuck with adam again and his pursuit of the profound it's a long trip which drags in many places in fact it's the longest hour and a half movie i've ever seen and the finale hardly makes it seem worth while at all br br i discovered this movie playing on hbo one day by waking up too early and <UNK> on the tv that'll learn me next time i'll try harder to sleep in
<START> this would have to rate as one of the worst films of all time the film screened at the italian film festival in melbourne australia after the screening not only did i want my money <UNK> i wanted the 1 5 wasted hours of my life back too i have a very broad tolerance level when it comes to the <UNK> of some european film making but this is one of those films that is selected for festivals based on the reputation of the filmmaker alone this film is proof that while such <UNK> may satisfy the <UNK> of the film maker and the selection <UNK> there is absolutely no joy for the audience there is no character development whatsoever the plot is a <UNK> mess the style is nonsensical the shot selection is appalling and the editing is worse by the end of the first reel you'll wonder if you walked into the wrong cinema and by the end of the third reel you'll be begging to be put out of your misery this film is an abomination
<START> is the longest running daily soap in germany and it's cult i started watching it from the first day on and i got hooked on it right from the start over the years so much has changed the old characters like <UNK> tina etc left and new ones appeared like marie <UNK> <UNK> or john i have to say that i liked better in the years 1995 2000 because today the show focuses too much on the younger characters my favorite character is <UNK> because she is the most scheming person that has ever been on that soap and she is also one of the most interesting characters on the show tina was great as the first <UNK> but as became the <UNK> of <UNK> the character got even better
<START> i recently saw this at the 2007 palm springs international film festival where it ended up as one of the audience favorites this is a spoof on the french <UNK> industry of <UNK> <UNK> films of the 50's and 60's the first <UNK> <UNK> film based on the novel by jean bruce was brought to the screen in 1956 long before the first james bond film staring <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> de la bath and six subsequent action adventure spy films were made up to 1970 with luc <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and john all taking turns as <UNK> <UNK> jean is in the title role in this comedic take on the series as the film begins set in 1945 he has a french mustache and resembles <UNK> but as the film begins it's setting of 1955 he really looks like sean connery jean <UNK> wrote this hilarious screenplay of a spy sent to egypt to investigate the murder of a friend it borrows on the silliness of naked gun get smart and the pink <UNK> and uses fresh humor on current events in a delightful combination that international audiences will enjoy and i am sure this will be the only the first of more to come of a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> to comedy adventures michel directs i would give this a 7 5 and recommend it
<START> i did not read the book nor do i care to the movie was a beautiful romance and i think women will enjoy it no it was not a 10 film but it was enjoyable women if your man is bored as mine was then watch it yourself hurt is wonderful as the <UNK> doctor who delivers a thoughtful monologue on in love and loving br br also if you like nick cage he was terrific and funny i enjoyed watching the developing romance br br also if you like christian <UNK> do see him in <UNK> this is a 10 sci fi movie br br do see this film ignore the previous <UNK> comments br br one especially the ladies also do visit my website at my name as one word and a <UNK> com
<START> as a sci fi movies fan i also like alien but pitch black is definitely better than alien 3 and alien <UNK> it well into alien series but it isn't alien it's something else ok enough comparisons this movie but me think why people are afraid of dark you can't run away from dark it's impossible you have to be faced with darkness and with that what's in dark in this movie i also liked that the <UNK> <UNK> character richard b <UNK> wasn't typical good boy he had a secrets and he has done bad things in the past to the other people he is a hero who tries to save them all first of all he want to get out of that planet himself there is also other <UNK> in this story every big sci fi fan should see this picture
<START> i seem to be <UNK> with a lot of folks here but i really did not find this movie as <UNK> as the reviews i read claimed it was no doubt a touching story and the <UNK> background provided the scope for an epic but the movie was a let down specially for who has seen <UNK> of the lead being played by sunny <UNK> and the <UNK> songs i must say <UNK> is the better of the two the story being virtually the same <UNK> failed to create any depth in its characters as well as the scenes that were supposed to <UNK> an impact over looking <UNK> accent and the image which in itself wasn't an easy job the characters just did not seem too real not that i am <UNK> the acting by any of the lead it just did not work the atmosphere was well drawn up but the movie really lacked in substance not that i am die hard rambo fan but some action have seen the movie through or some character development it all seemed like a rush to the finish and the ending only added to the viewers <UNK> br br i must say that it was at least a good effort in seemingly unfamiliar territory by the director and if u haven't seen <UNK> then u <UNK> even like it
<START> i have watched this movie time and time and time again each time it makes me laugh it makes me think and it makes me cry robin does an incredible job of portraying <UNK> and i'm kind of glad that kate <UNK> and that other lady turned down her part its just one of those rolls that you know that no one else could have even compared br br its a beautiful love story of these 2 very different people in crappy situations that team up together they stand beside each other no matter what even if it is in an odd situation and crazy ways br br i'll tell you now its not for everyone out of everyone i've shown it to i'd say the results are 50 50 but if you like it you'll love it and want to share it with others 10 stars all the way
<START> this is the one major problem with this film along with a good deal of biggest movies done in a pretentious way by pretentious people br br it's really sad but big shots movie makers driving dodge <UNK> from this <UNK> believes they got the they know what the little people like br br we're not a rich <UNK> every time a big movie like this 30 millions is made it's cutting off a lot of others who won't see their movie made because of lack of <UNK> help so it <UNK> mediocrity only movies from friends of the family are going to be made br br i sound angry and i am i went see <UNK> france expecting a journey in the lives of my <UNK> but i found myself stuck in a pool of inconsistencies french accent we gotta please our cousins so f our language and lack of historical research is only a few add a campy love story and the same music score playing again and again and dumb viewer is gonna open up and ask for more i'm glad this pretentious piece of s didn't do as planned by the dodge <UNK> big shots it's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained movie business of br br rent <UNK> bar instead and have a real good time br br ps i'll never forgive them for ruining such an awesome title
<START> alice enters in a world of wonder but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a kid the mad <UNK> the white rabbit the queen and others even and show alice some things about her body and other people's bodies that might be quite wonderful a tale of love and lust the likes you've never seen br br <UNK> <UNK> appears as alice i must say by 1970s standards this may be the most attractive adult actress of her day i believe this is her only film before moving on to mainstream work but it was pretty much the best possible one she could have chosen my love for all things alice is no secret even better than fairy tales which isn't really pornography so much br br the songs are cheesy but fit the theme of the movie one song what's a girl like you doing on a knight like this was pretty funny and the others had similar themes going the trial towards the end was well scripted and fit very nicely into the world of alice the logic and humor were definitely <UNK> for br br what more can you say about a film like this all i know is for people who are used to adult films where it's just a 30 second lead in to the sex this one is going to <UNK> you with plot and music but personally i think there's something very special about this film and i hope it gets a nice dvd release with things touched up and special features if that's even possible i can see this being a cult film
<START> is probably the word i'd use to try and start describing this film i only watched it because it had a good rating on here and i was so let down br br basically the film is about racism in a post 9 11 america and the director went at it with a <UNK> hammer there was no subtlety in the film at all and it felt as though they were trying to achieve a kind of <UNK> feel to the film which is never a good idea as that film was three hours of tedium and confusion only for it to start <UNK> <UNK> at the end br br all in all a huge disappointment
<START> well this movie is really <UNK> haha get it thats kinda like the attitude of this movie the plot is just a copy of pulp fiction okay thats acceptable but to make this piece if <UNK> haha is really unbelievable the storyline is so pathetic and the whole thing only gathered a few laughs it did try making a few jokes from various other movies and it failed most of the times i mean i do have a sense of humor but this <UNK> really the way to go to get a laugh most of the supposedly funny moments are completely ironic the film is quiet short running at around 75 minutes overall they could have done a much funnier job seeming they made fun of a blockbuster film they were gambling and hey i think they lost br br in overall <UNK> fiction is but you wont gather much at all br br worth watching over and over again no once is enough actually its more than enough br br so is it worth the rent <UNK> as i said its but you will only gather a few from it br br overall out of 10 a 4 out of 10
<START> i don't care if this show is suppose to be <UNK> profound messages about human existence br br the show is crap how can anyone <UNK> pleasure from watching it yet it was received so well this reflects a sad state of affairs for joe moron out there br br i tried watching this program when it first came out as friends were talking about it the inane laughing between the two main characters and the pitiful dialog made me want to cry br br it is beyond belief that people can watch this show yet i guess the creators had the last laugh making themselves wealthy by taking the p ss out of the very people that would watch a show such as this br br i would <UNK> they are laughing all the way to the bank
<START> i actually was looking forward to this movie after reading a number of reviews before the release it sounded like a genuinely nice film one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting cast nicholas cage penelope <UNK> and john hurt br br well it might have been all of those things but it is so boring that i defy almost anyone to sit through this in its entirety and keep attention also <UNK> attempt at speaking with an italian accent is embarrassingly bad he's such a good actor that i <UNK> every time he spoke in this film br br seems to be the most often word used by reviewers here to describe this film and i totally agree br br i guess it didn't take long for word to get out about how bad this movie was because like <UNK> accent it did not do well
<START> this movie about a group of small town teens that decide to rob the local bank is excellent brian justin walker wants to get out of his small town much like jimmy stewart in it's a wonderful life however unlike george <UNK> brian is going to rob a bank to <UNK> his dream of attending art school even if his father is not supportive the offer to brian is to act like a <UNK> and distract the guard it's a <UNK> offer that if offered to many i question what they would do anyways brian does it when the sheriff james <UNK> and his force surround the bank things go from bad to worse it's a <UNK> with even the <UNK> moving in to kill the kids if they have a clean shot the sheriff must prevent this and try to end the <UNK> in a peaceful way unfortunately tensions rise and the teens inside turn on each other some are out of control the paper cutter scene is gruesome and hard to watch very intense
<START> this is one of the most awful movies i've had the misfortune of picking up don't get me wrong i love a good zombie flick but this wasn't one of them br br might as well from the opening scenes at least been called zombies from outer <UNK> it had absolutely nothing to do with the other movie or the video game as far as i could tell br br the best aspect of the film is how the two main characters can get covered with so much blood and remain so <UNK> i would certainly suggest giving this one and miss and staying with a <UNK> zombie <UNK> like <UNK> days <UNK> or <UNK> of the living <UNK> the remake of course unless you're into some serious campy action
<START> like many people in my general age range i remember going to see this movie as a kid in <UNK> and coming out of the theatre practically in tears it seemed at the time to be one of the most important awe inspiring cinematic experiences of our generation at once riveting action packed funny heartbreaking and truly inspirational really did have everything going on right down to the catchy theme song and sappy tear <UNK> of an ending br br sweet what were we smoking i watched it for the first time in years last night on one of the movie channels and i cannot even describe it this is truly one of the worst movies ever made where to even begin leaving aside the <UNK> of laughable scientific errors on <UNK> yeah sure thanks for that billy bob i'd have to say the worst thing about it was the remarkable dare i even say <UNK> way in which it combined crappy writing with crappy acting there are too many examples of this to even begin listing here but one in particular springs to mind the scene where bruce willis is telling the <UNK> exactly where to go to track down each of the oh so <UNK> <UNK> members of his oil <UNK> team <UNK> every bar in new <UNK> 'the <UNK> tables in <UNK> 'the only black guy on a motorcycle in all to the tune of <UNK> <UNK> it reminded me a bit of the news team <UNK> scene from anchorman except serious ben affleck proves once again that he is by far the most <UNK> actor in hollywood having less depth range and overall talent than anyone else in the business not that bruce willis <UNK> tyler or anyone else in this <UNK> piece of garbage was much better br br i have to say though i got a kick out of seeing a pre stardom owen wilson get killed off half way through is this the only movie where his character dies br br peter <UNK> is perfect as the most stereotypical <UNK> russian you have ever scene then again peter <UNK> does seem to have a talent for playing over the top it really was quite amusing how almost immediately after the americans <UNK> with the russian space station which is actually called that in the movie ben affleck succeeds in <UNK> causing the whole joint to explode in spectacular hollywood fashion i also love the fact that in the end paris is the only place on earth to get destroyed and that absolutely no one seems to care and on top of all that it at points literally turns into <UNK> ads for <UNK> martin and kerr <UNK> oh how proud i am to be an american br br there's plenty of other stuff to rant about but i won't suffice it to say that this is a really really really terrible movie that i feel ashamed to have ever genuinely liked br br i give it two stars just for the factor
<START> i am looking at all the good reviews about this film and i start thinking to myself am i going crazy can't i see the beauty from a film like this am i just dumb enough to not understand the message this film is trying to point out i don't know maybe one of those <UNK> entered in my head and ate all my brains as well the film idea was going nowhere i was sure it would have a <UNK> end and of course it did nothing exceptional not even the landscapes i <UNK> that being placed in a mountain village at least the landscapes would be nice but no just a lame story about a crazy teacher and of course her crazy students now all grown up each of them with his her own fixed ideas and boy some of those ideas were stupid like the lizard story for example at a moment i thought i was watching x files with the lizard entering in the ear and all no from my point of view this movie is a waste of time not to say money if u pay for the ticket the only part that i did like was the acting of the young blue eye german kid he played very well and convincing for his age the rest nothing i read the previous review and i think the script writer and the director were both on drugs when they came up with those ideas well considering that there are a lot of people that enjoyed this film i think to myself again maybe i am the crazy one advice don't waste your time with this
<START> it's a real big <UNK> that people easily are able too make movies because of cheap digital video <UNK> nowadays usually i would appreciate this possibility but if you see movies like this it's just a big shame and it's also big shame if people like h p <UNK> get abused by the likes of this i rented this movie <UNK> of the drop h p <UNK> on it and i'm a big fan of many of his <UNK> mainly those done by brian <UNK> stuart gordon this movie has nothing to deliver a cheap scenery on a beach and in an old wine <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> effect red light over the whole movie no actors just some stupid low grade models who have for sure no idea what they are doing stiff as wood and so must be the director it's obvious that he tried to create some atmosphere but as the whole things is so laughable it just doesn't work and no gore effects just some blood in a river you drink you become demon and dropping here and there oh yeah the story thousands of years ago some big old <UNK> the world and took humans as slaves then mankind got independent so the old ones tried to destroy them and now there are some survivors in a post apocalyptic world the only possibility to save mankind is to find the <UNK> that's where it gets to <UNK> so those soldiers fight against some undead and demons on their beach and in their wine <UNK> unbelievable the whole thing but as it is dubbed german title des and you can find it in most commercial video stores it seems as if you can make money with stuff like that i find this fact impressive
<START> this is the best version of gypsy that has been filmed bette midler is simply superb as mama rose she has the voice the gestures the look and most of all a supreme acting ability to carry the role off and to make her character come alive her singing is simply put magnificent she especially shines in two numbers <UNK> coming up <UNK> and <UNK> turn the other actors are also fine particularly christine as <UNK> also good is peter <UNK> his portrayal of <UNK> is acted with great style and believability the direction of this movie is very very good there isn't a false note or <UNK> in the entire production this film is a vast improvement over the <UNK> russell version filmed in <UNK> since viewing it again i can state that the three greatest mama <UNK> are <UNK> <UNK> bette midler and angela lansbury see this movie you'll be glad that you did
<START> he did one at christmas to try and bring back a number one song and now the terrific justin lee collins wanted to reunite the cast members and maybe some crew of one of his favourite tv shows as a kid the a team the only member he wouldn't be able to get was the late great george <UNK> who played main character <UNK> john <UNK> smith but he did get some kind of psychic to try and help he did manage to reunite all members including <UNK> <UNK> lt <UNK> peck 2 who went to celebrity big brother in 2007 dwight <UNK> capt h m howling mad <UNK> melinda amy amanda allen william <UNK> <UNK> lynch and lance <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the only member of the team to die he did talk to mr t sgt b a in an anticipated interview but he was <UNK> to turn up at the reunion it was really fun watching him trying to find them and talking to them even though they probably didn't want to and the reunion of course is the great climax very good
<START> a bright <UNK> interested in serious music admittedly a <UNK> breed <UNK> play the <UNK> when no one can play the <UNK> could find this an interesting fiction about street kids and great musical stars was indeed the greatest <UNK> of his generation and the film gives him a rare on screen chance to display his technique the kids especially gene reynolds are fine and all in all the <UNK> is a good example of first rate studio family fare of the late 30's it doesn't hit the top of the great <UNK> list but it's a nice way for an intelligent family to spend a rainy afternoon with <UNK> or the video store good luck at blockbuster
<START> this film is a variation of a theme we've all seen over and over again the adventure in space the characters are all stock characters <UNK> heroine <UNK> coward etc etc the only question really is who's next to snuff it sometimes this tried and tested formula works like in this case but more often not like the truly mind numbing red planet br br so why does this one work because it's stylish the acting is above average and above all it isn't predictable the conclusion isn't sign posted i really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end that alone deserves top marks in my book br br it's an intriguing and entertaining movie and though it was never likely to change the face of cinema as we know it it doesn't disappoint
<START> <UNK> is not for an <UNK> adventure seeking audience there are no explosions nor is the drama straightforward like the films of <UNK> <UNK> the director is working more deeply with mood than with storytelling in a manner that is effective and incredibly moving because it does not rely on gratuitous nudity or superficial pop cult story lines this is quite frankly one of the best gay foreign film i have seen also see <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> nicolas <UNK> don't look now gets a lot of bad press because it is sold as a horror film that film like <UNK> is more than what the box might lead you to believe if you are in the mood to sit back and be absorbed by the subtle transformed powers of cinema you'll love this movie
<START> this film is a very bad example of uninspired storytelling which tries to hide behind an <UNK> trying to shock the audience with <UNK> violence against women to cover up for it's lack of psychological depth of the characters internal conflicts everything in this movie is pretentious from the thank <UNK> to bela <UNK> at the beginning to the photography the acting music the story editing when suddenly without reason you are forced to watch close ups of charismatic looking hungarian country people in their <UNK> while the soundtrack is trying to <UNK> you that this is supposed to be a dramatic moment although they are only on the way to the funeral of the local alcoholic thats one thing putting completely <UNK> rape scenes as a shocker is a different thing for which i absolutely have no <UNK> this movie is trying really hard to enter a certain genre of artistic east european drama kind of films but lacks the subtlety <UNK> skills and soul that other directors have
<START> if you are looking for the feel good hit of the summer dark <UNK> 2 might just be your ticket the production values of this movie are extremely high looks as if it were filmed with a <UNK> and edited using <UNK> especially the sound effects they sound straight off of a spooky halloween sounds cd the scarecrow from the cover although he doesn't appear in the movie and otherwise has no relevance is <UNK> realistic from beginning to end you'll watch as a man <UNK> <UNK> for his daughters through a pun intended <UNK> at the climactic ending of the movie you'll see well you'll have to watch for yourself br br what i'm really trying to say here is don't come within 1000 <UNK> of this movie i rented it because i thought it would be a campy sort of <UNK> 2 funny but it's not i cried after i watched this movie because i realized i had spent money on it and i found the 4 i spent on renting it i actually fell asleep for 20 minutes and still knew what was going on
<START> yes it takes a norwegian to ruin and slaughter two great books and a concept that would work well on film this film truly is the worst swedish film of all time i hated it so badly that i even considered walking out on it something i have never done but it was so awful i was almost compelling i just had to sit through to the end much like some early 80's stallone action reel this one really takes swedish action back to the stone age so full of logical errors and stupid mistakes it is almost amusing but who could ever see anything good in the terrible acting mark <UNK> surviving a mine field or the dumb ass useless and irrational action br br let me ask you aren't we through with <UNK> <UNK> down to zero the hero escaping in the nick of time and two friends become enemies <UNK> by the end stupid br br and one more thing the product placement in this film is unbelievable while other countries have understood that it shouldn't be so obvious the swedish film industry apparently hasn't understood at all just look at the credit card hamilton uses to open a window or or or this film really makes me mad
<START> the best thing about this flick is that it seems like they used a lot of stuff left over from the pearl harbor attack in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> my favorite was the shot of the p 40 crashing into the row of <UNK> p 40s but filmed from the top of a <UNK> or <UNK> unfortunately it just gets worse from there br br there's two black guys and two white guys as american <UNK> as well as some <UNK> <UNK> and japanese guards the <UNK> <UNK> of the americans is a white naval lieutenant which is of course an o 3 in the navy at any rate he's in need of a <UNK> badly <UNK> badly hockey hair does not belong in a wwii movie oh and he's a racist he doesn't want to share quarters with the of course in real life he wouldn't want to share quarters with the white <UNK> guy either i think the <UNK> convention has a <UNK> about officers quarters and <UNK> but that wasn't the point here oh well i think plot is secondary to other issues in this flick he gets put in his place and pretty much spends the rest of the movie as a look out and running the air <UNK> for the <UNK> br br but once you get going it's not a bad story line the <UNK> want the <UNK> to raise the silver thrown out by the americans before fell the <UNK> resistance wants them to take their time and the <UNK> do their best to help a potentially good story and not that badly done i guess a bit unbelievable when the <UNK> use camp made re to swim between the <UNK> camp and the <UNK> village every night maybe i'm not that <UNK> when i know going in that this is not a blockbuster film i guess that's why it comes on a 20 pack dvd war movie collection for five bucks br br the 70s music did not belong in this movie or any wwii movie it's quite distracting to say the least the acting was not that bad probably better than i could do br br not being a fan of football at least i found out that jim brown is a real person and not somebody richard <UNK> made up that in itself was worth the i paid for this movie br br worth watching on tcm or paying a quarter for br br one star for being a war movie another for being wwii and one more because i'm feeling generous
<START> this movie is in the same league as <UNK> lots of wasted talent who let this bomb escape when <UNK> says an example has to be made in reference to a nuclear bomb i said please let it be this theatre don't waste your time not even worth a free rental and where did they get these <UNK> to fill the comments section on imdb i can't believe that anyone who has ever seen the original series enjoyed this stinker steve carell is not a physical comedian if they removed the comedy and made it a straight action movie it could pass what the heck was the purpose of the dance scene also the fat jokes and references were tasteless this movie never missed a chance to go for the lowest common <UNK> and scenes just ended it seemed as if no one thought them through just awful save your time if not money and give this movie a pass
<START> <UNK> coward is perfectly cast as a suave vain selfish well educated upper class <UNK> the literary crowd that <UNK> at his office is equally lacking in depth and seems concerned only with their status and success they constantly meet at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> office in the hope of gaining favor for their next book and to make sure they are not left out on the latest <UNK> in the artistic realm br br <UNK> is a young <UNK> and poet who believes her love can change <UNK> coward and that they can establish a long lasting relationship she ends her relationship with her fiancé to become lover however <UNK> returns to his playboy ways after 6 months and ends the relationship this breaks heart and she eventually returns to her fiancé who has since lost his job and self respect after losing <UNK> br br the story picks up when <UNK> coward leaves new york city by plane chasing after a new lover a concert <UNK> who is just as shallow as he is however a storm is encountered and the plane crashes into the sea killing <UNK> god takes pity on him and <UNK> him one month on earth to find someone who will cry for him otherwise he is condemned to wander the earth never to find rest for all eternity br br the climax takes place on a dim rainy night and ends with a <UNK> and a miracle a strange redemption occurs the death experience teaches <UNK> the true values of life although his former associate artists are incapable of understanding his message br br the film has beautiful music and the scenes are classic film noir unfortunately it is not on dvd or vhs for those who enjoy this type of movie it is a classic masterpiece <UNK> <UNK> dialog is sharp and witty and no one could play the part better
<START> bloody birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as <UNK> monsters steven andy freeman curtis billy <UNK> credited as billy <UNK> and debbie elizabeth <UNK> were all born on the same day during an <UNK> besides sharing a birthday they also share a love of murder and they're not <UNK> about who they kill either young billy elizabeth and andy play the parts of these <UNK> monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too but they can't go on <UNK> everyone this is an overall good horror flick its not too unrealistic there are a few good moments of suspense and the kids portrayed the roles well the grown ups are pretty hammy though i'd say its well worth seeing i own a copy myself
<START> i watched this film not knowing anything about it i had presumed it was a sci fi b movie of some sort how wrong i was the plot is enthralling and intelligent the cast are all charismatic and the whole film just makes you think for a change some of the <UNK> <UNK> me completely but in the end the answers were rather simple i am quite <UNK> at the low <UNK> of this film as i thought it was quite unusual if you liked the film <UNK> seven with brad pit or the matrix then you will like this there is no major special effects or fancy <UNK> here at all it is all about the plot about building the characters and building an atmosphere it is a film however than ultimately provides no answers which may <UNK> some people but i thought the ending was great i am still not sure if the film is based on an true story or not
<START> now out of all the shark movies i've seen this one takes the cake the plot of the movie was good but the excitement factor sort of took a <UNK> afterwards antonio jr does an excellent role as a son who seeks the shark who killed his father a is one of the biggest sharks of all and the most dangerous one as well the view of the shark was indeed scary in some angles but the effects were a <UNK> and the scenes were a little weak in some places with the mini weapons there that would take out a whole school of sharks there it was great that the son would get the exact revenge on that monstrosity although it would indeed cost him his life as well like they say revenge has it's price but was it worth it that answer could go on and on and this movie was a major letdown the beginning was fine and at the end it went like the titanic 1 out of 5 stars
<START> this was a disgrace to the game <UNK> i had much expectations but all ended up in a nightmare besides the bad acting the visual effects stunts the plot even the humor used in the movie was an absolute flop the movie is not worth watching at all the funniest part was when the girl comes and kiss jack in order to give him the key to the <UNK> guess the she got the keys to <UNK> all the time i hope some good director will make a remake of this fantastic game into a movie someday and i they will <UNK> some good cash to get the visual effects right and the right as well as the acting right but till then don't waste time by trying to watch this movie because it will surely make you go mad specially if you are a <UNK> lover
<START> i really wanted to like this movie a film with zombie children getting out of a mine to kill people at night really seemed like a great idea for a horror film unfortunately the film was in the bottom 3 of films played at horror fest br br a mother and her two daughters attempt to move on after her husband father had passed away from an illness that cost their family a lot of money they have to adapt to their new environment they end up struggling due to all the surroundings for different reasons crazy zombie kids go into this category the film never gives any sentimental <UNK> for anyone that lives or dies the film produces no scares or jump worthy moments the film barely shows the children doing what they're supposed to do kill with a bigger budget and a better cast this film could have hope until then pass on it br br 3 5 10 actually
<START> i just can't get it freaks out on the planet are talking about this one as a must seen they even dare to call it a s exploitation because the possessed girl is <UNK> priests and is <UNK> all time don't let me laugh i watched the movie <UNK> is only at the end of the movie and don't call it <UNK> it's just bad language that's she is talking and the is a big laugh too she tries to seduce her father while <UNK> let me be clear with her clothes on you <UNK> out there it isn't gory or bloody at all everybody is <UNK> on beyond the door well let me tell that one is for me better than this flick only the last 5 minutes the possessed one is <UNK> and having weird eyes if i had know that this is so bad then i would never caught me a copy if you really <UNK> to see a s about <UNK> watch angel above the devil below or other cheesy ones a <UNK> of time this is
<START> this film is one of the best memories i have from childhood having always loved <UNK> my mum took me to see it br br it is absolutely amazing its is one of those films that leaves a lasting impression on you the image of <UNK> running through the snow with it all <UNK> around is still in my head some 25 <UNK> on not many films have managed that as other comments have said photography is stunning a must see i have also been looking for the film for some time with no luck at all checking amazon every now and then reveals nothing not even listed if anyone does know of a source please contact me or post here tim

<START> in the light of the recent <UNK> that hit the country hard that is <UNK> i thought it upon myself to re watch black rain 1988 japan <UNK> <UNK> haunting black and white masterpiece on the destruction and after effects of the atomic bomb that hit <UNK> in the closing period of the second world war the destruction and impact of both <UNK> war and <UNK> may <UNK> in degree and quality but the trauma and <UNK> physically and psychologically nevertheless are still there br br it is a testament to a film's power that its images remain as potent and as <UNK> as when they were first seen it is only that the difference now in my case is that watching those images has assumed a greater sense of <UNK> and <UNK> due to a first hand experience of a near monumental weather <UNK> there is a sense of <UNK> so to speak br br <UNK> has always been one of my favorite japanese filmmakers his films are always a pleasure to watch because of their <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the introduction to <UNK> 1966 1981 warm water under a red bridge 2001 his two <UNK> <UNK> winners <UNK> of 1983 and the <UNK> 1997 to name some given the mood of his films who would have thought that he once served as an assistant director to <UNK> <UNK> japanese <UNK> most <UNK> and <UNK> filmmaker but then it is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> that <UNK> was <UNK> against br br but then again with black rain one can <UNK> sense <UNK> <UNK> the father or the father figure being intent on seeing his daughter get married before time runs out on both of them and the <UNK> and <UNK> of the scenes showing all members of the family together notably the dinner scenes or in <UNK> film <UNK> the are something that the <UNK> master filmmaker would explore in his works tokyo story late spring essentially the over all subdued and deliberate quality of black rain is a remarkable contrast to the chaos and <UNK> drive of <UNK> entire filmography br br still this is not to say that watching the film would not be an altogether unsettling experience black rain as <UNK> described by american film reviewer leonard <UNK> is filled with haunting black and white images in the film's first 15 minutes <UNK> pulls no punches in showing the immediate and graphic horrors of the nuclear bombing one after another <UNK> burnt bodies hanging flesh walking dead fires and <UNK> everywhere madness all over an assault to the <UNK> senses definitely it is coupled with takashi somber b w photography he did the <UNK> in crime drama the incident and <UNK> chilling score he did the music in such classics as <UNK> <UNK> ran and double suicide br br even during the film's supposed <UNK> phase that is five years after the atomic bombing one can still never have a sense of <UNK> and order with the <UNK> and pain still being strongly felt by the survivors not only in terms of failing physical health but more so in terms of psychological trauma and social <UNK> the human race it now <UNK> appears has been destined to bear the legacy of the bomb for as long as it lives br br i already wrote a piece about black rain some years earlier posted in imdb com but only in comparison to <UNK> magnificent tin drum another film dealing with monumental human <UNK> and global catastrophe moreover it has never been my practice to write twice about a film that i already wrote something about before it is in the light of the recent weather <UNK> that <UNK> our country that i was <UNK> to re visit and write something again about this remarkable <UNK> film as there is a wealth of lessons to be learned from both the film and the recent event in regards the <UNK> and dangers of scientific knowledge and action and the long term <UNK> and wounds inflicted by a wide scale destruction whether human or nature induced br br there have been a number of films dealing with nuclear holocaust and destruction testament threads the war game each <UNK> within their own respective countries and black rain stands among them if not more so for both its <UNK> and somber portrayal of individual and <UNK> <UNK> brought about by atomic <UNK> and the fact that it has a historical event as its basis br br few weeks from now another disaster film from hollywood <UNK> <UNK> will finally hit no pun intended the big screen as we all know this american director's bunch of disaster apocalypse films independence day godzilla the day after tomorrow serves no other purpose than to be of mere entertainment value with no real insight into the nature and wisdom of apocalyptic disaster and the human condition being affected i wonder how this gigantic movie would exploit the trauma <UNK> and <UNK> still being experienced by our people because of the recent weather <UNK> to say that this flick is a <UNK> tale would probably be no more than an <UNK> br br but yes i will still watch <UNK>

<START> i always loved french movies because i think they are filled with much more emotion and sense than the americans this film is a gem br br starting with the wedding which is so funny that you just want to join them and in the end where the little family kids tell us who is with who which is <UNK> funny catherine <UNK> is simply hot and so good that it is absolutely possible that a young man can fall in love with her and <UNK> is perfect for that role the best scene except the wedding party is in the family reunion where <UNK> has got mad and yells his feelings to <UNK> in front of the family it is such a shame that i could buy this film only from the french and not from the english so i have to learn in french to enjoy watching it
<START> i would have been about 11 years old when this movie was first released all these years later at <UNK> and i had no <UNK> hiring it on dvd great entertainment for all ages and what about the song the <UNK> connection see br br why are there so many songs about <UNK> and what's on the other side <UNK> are visions but only <UNK> and <UNK> have nothing to hide so we've been told and some choose to believe it i know they're wrong wait and see someday we'll find it the <UNK> connection the lovers the <UNK> and me br br who said that every wish would be heard and answered when wished on the morning star somebody thought of that and someone believed it and look what it's done so far what's so amazing that keeps us <UNK> and what do we think we might see someday we'll find it the <UNK> connection the lovers the <UNK> and me br br all of us under its spell we know that it's probably magic br br have you been half asleep and have you heard voices i've heard them calling my name is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors the voice might be one and the same i've heard it too many times to ignore it it's something that i'm <UNK> to be someday we'll find it the <UNK> connection the lovers the <UNK> and me br br da dee da la la la dee doo
<START> i have always loved bad creations <UNK> criticism and my film professor <UNK> that for me in college this is not as bad as the star wars holiday special there is nothing bottom of the than that mistake this the fantastic four film complete with the i have no idea why hes <UNK> <UNK> his fingers doctor doom is high on the list of <UNK> mistakes <UNK> dialogue kill him let him go is classic as it is <UNK> in its hilarity the editing is good and the director of photography isn't half bad those are the up sides i cannot however subject all my friends to watch in its entirety but if i can get the chance i show them the can <UNK> and sue come to outer space with us scene i do i also include the final scene scene where <UNK> richards in his <UNK> outfit for some reason alongside his bride sue in her wedding dress get into the <UNK> the payoff is the arm in farewell as they drive away most people are in complete disbelief that something like this exists
<START> <UNK> is a computer part which <UNK> russian messages so that america can't understand them they can only be read by the intended <UNK> the americans know that the russians are going to <UNK> a message revealing the plans of five political <UNK> they want to carry out br br so they send in former martin sheen to grab the and substitute a false part so they'll be able to <UNK> the message and block the assassination attempts br br however as we listen in on the americans heads of the spy <UNK> we find that they already have the and they want to try to steal <UNK> only to convince the russians that they don't already have it they don't expect to succeed that way the russians who had stopped <UNK> with <UNK> just in case will begin <UNK> again br br <UNK> is in the computer in the office of <UNK> somehow must gain access and in order to do that he must find out when will be out he sends in his former girlfriend karen <UNK> <UNK> to seduce so that she can look through his papers and find out his <UNK> movements karen is glad to do it as they tortured her father a university professor to death br br because we know that it's better for the americans if fails the movie becomes even more intense as a spy thriller we find ourselves hoping he can survive against the odds especially as he uses ingenious methods to beat the russians at every turn br br but what's this are karen and falling in love will win karen back or will she actually end up with the romantic twist lifts this spy thriller already worthy of a ten even higher for its originality the writing the direction and the acting all combine to make this new and fascinating twist a <UNK> realistic one br br you find yourself at the edge of your seat gripping your <UNK> not only for the excitement of the spy story but for the intensely beautiful romantic love story as well the two themes are <UNK> perfectly right up to the end you really want both sides to win so who does win in the end you'll have to see the movie and find out won't you
<START> if you liked the grinch movie go watch that again because this was no where near as good a <UNK> movie translation mike <UNK> cat is probably the most annoying character to grace the screen in recent times his voice accent is terrible and he laughs at his own jokes with an awful <UNK> sound which is about the only laughing i heard at the theater not even the kids liked this one folks and kids laugh at anything now save your money and go see looney tunes back in action if you're really looking for a fun holiday family movie
<START> this is just one of the hundred million movies where the directors try to <UNK> too much drama into a movie that's not dramatic at all like in the beginning the part where the monk dude shoved the arrow into his own hand then shot that same arrow into the <UNK> five minutes later no sense whatsoever br br the only thing worse than the plot line is the cgi which would be greatly <UNK> by a <UNK> flash movie the actors look like they're doing their hardest to portray a bunch of 70's robots the dialogue makes so little sense it's not funny br br many things just happen with no explanation as to how or why such as a lady suddenly wandering around a <UNK> that had shut down hours ago and when she sees this thing flying towards her her first reaction is to take a picture rather than what she does a full ten minutes later power walking not even running like her life <UNK> on it which obviously it doesn't br br overall not recommended makes me wish they still did new episodes of mst3k
<START> <UNK> doesn't deliver the goods this half baked mafia comedy boasts a stellar cast including joe <UNK> kevin <UNK> joe <UNK> jennifer <UNK> and seymour <UNK> along with a number of faces familiar to those who watch crime movies but it is truly a misfire if there ever was one writer director mark malone best known for writing dead of winter for bonnie clyde director arthur penn has penned up a pedestrian <UNK> that has an <UNK> but vengeful mob boss <UNK> seymour <UNK> <UNK> his son <UNK> joe <UNK> of house of games to <UNK> <UNK> it seems that a rival mob fire bombed one of <UNK> <UNK> in the opening scene and wants <UNK> trouble is that nobody has a clue as to who <UNK> is in any other mob comedy such a <UNK> might be amusing but here is just plain flat <UNK> and a <UNK> of including his best pal <UNK> kevin <UNK> of spend half of the time trying to find out who <UNK> is neither <UNK> nor <UNK> want to perform the hit so they track down a crazy mob hit man charlie joe <UNK> of bad boys to do the dirty deed before they can convince charlie to make the hit they have to locate him and charlie's <UNK> wife mary jennifer <UNK> of bound reveals that he is locked up in a mental hospital our <UNK> heroes cruise out to the mental hospital and break charlie out about half of the movie is over before they discover that <UNK> is a kid in short pants vincent <UNK> who is bland and harmless indeed <UNK> has the only decent line in the movie as our brainless bunch of heroes wheel away from his house with him in the <UNK> to take care of business <UNK> warns them that they need to get him home in time or his father will kill him charlie tries to ice the <UNK> but he cannot instead he <UNK> with his feelings and wants to go back to the mental hospital so he can report the good news to his doctor meanwhile after charlie decides not to shoot <UNK> the kid gets his <UNK> on the pistol and pops off several <UNK> rounds <UNK> and he struggle over the automatic the pistol slips out of their collective hands and hits the ground goes off and blows a hole in chest now keep in mind that <UNK> never wanted to shoot the kid in the first place and <UNK> and he <UNK> over the wrong <UNK> of the hit so <UNK> winds up on the ground with a fatal wound while <UNK> struggles to stop the bleeding talk about a dull death scene <UNK> is conflicted himself because his father ordered the hit and <UNK> fears that dad will do him in if he doesn't <UNK> orders there is a flashback subplot about <UNK> father teaching him how to handle a gun that provides some insight into <UNK> <UNK> to pack a gun br br there is nothing remotely redeeming about this depressing comedy with a <UNK> of an ending things gets worse and if you last through this 90 minute nonsense you'll see what i mean the comedy is largely laugh less good actors <UNK> in <UNK> roles that aren't even funny perhaps director malone was trying to do another comedy like the gang that couldn't shoot straight if he was he missed by a mile big <UNK> jennifer <UNK> shows <UNK> and <UNK> through a couple of scenes with <UNK> but she doesn't do much of anything else she's the stereotypical slut who doesn't even get naked a paycheck is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast otherwise this picture is pathetic from start to finish initially i had hoped that this might be a <UNK> of red chief <UNK> where the kid drives the nuts but no such luck here of course the biggest surprise is that they have to kill a kid but it's not the kind of a surprise that makes you want to watch it up to its resolution br br i actually bought this movie on a canadian dvd it contains only the most basic special features if you hate previews that give away the plot don't watch the trailer if you ever meet joe <UNK> one of your first questions should be why he helped to produce this <UNK> it is neither hilarious nor dramatic there are no <UNK> lines and none of the characters stand out as either interesting or sympathetic the <UNK> dvd presents the movie in full frame with no subtitles or closed <UNK>
<START> in the dvd era you would think you could find pretty much any piece of crap committed to celluloid and for the most part it's true so why why is it so hard to find this great little flick clearly done by people who love noir as a loving homage never <UNK> into spoof land of that most cinematic of genres emma thompson and alan <UNK> are a hoot in this and superstar in the making carla karen sin city does her now trademark red hot babe great acting routine br br this movie really has it all for fans of film a b noir on <UNK> the clever and steamy <UNK> kiss succeeds on every count br br please columbia <UNK> please release it on dvd soon
<START> this is one of those classic american made for tv movies that are just made for watching on a rainy afternoon although the script is highly implausible it never takes itself too seriously and neither do the cast which leads to a great tongue in cheek murder mystery horror film best enjoyed with a <UNK> bag of popcorn or box of <UNK> a big bonus of this film is the fantastic location filming and despite the strange goings on and even stranger residents round lake i for one would not mind living there br br all in all a great film to watch over and over again
<START> there is the thrill of low budget film noir and there is the frustration of meandering uninteresting movies made on the cheap this one falls into the second category br br the spot is the name of a nightclub the film is about a policeman whose father has been killed by gangsters he heads out to track them down br br maybe it was the bad print maybe it's me but i felt i'd seen this a hundred times most of those times better than it is here br br it has promise too the cop is fascinated with a woman who plays records she introduces over <UNK> boxes they then meet now though this was made well before i was born i have seen that kind of <UNK> box and it is incredibly fascinating when i was a teenager i <UNK> into a bar that still had such a device i always liked <UNK> boxes in bars or <UNK> but this one was different you talked to it and a <UNK> sounding female voice talked back to you that is addressed here but dropped into the general uninteresting <UNK> br br the movie has one thing going for it in a small role it features the very young anne <UNK> what a beauty she was and <UNK> still is
<START> this film certainly wasn't very sophisticated no the humor was in fact pretty dumb now that i think about it but also while i think of it i did laugh proving decent comedy doesn't need to be very deep br br <UNK> <UNK> is the definite star of this short despite buster keaton's appearing in the film as well he is the butcher in an old time <UNK> store a lot of silly stuff occurred in the store and i think i laughed the most at the coffee <UNK> sequence you'll just have to see it yourself br br anyway later <UNK> girlfriend is forced to go to a girls' school and because he can't stand to part he dresses in drag and <UNK> the school <UNK> is one ugly woman so for silly and <UNK> fun see this film it won't change your life and is a very slight picture but it's also fun
<START> the title tells it all ed <UNK> the butcher of br br it's not a action filled slasher movie made for teens high on energy drinks that would fit it into a well established genre the kind that some people find entertaining something along the lines of halloween or the texas chain saw massacre br br this is dark slow filled with chopped up corpses and quietly evil there are few shock cuts no <UNK> point of view shots no loud electronic score i don't know who it's aimed at <UNK> maybe br br beneath the credits we already see still photos of <UNK> <UNK> hung up <UNK> <UNK> across the backs of <UNK> that sort of thing and they're <UNK> revolting that i couldn't help thinking this movie had better be pretty good to make up for this grand <UNK> opening br br alas it's not the acting is uniformly terrible as in a high school play the script does its best to sink below <UNK> ed <UNK> who killed only two middle aged women and maybe his brother chases a screaming bloody young woman through the <UNK> of <UNK> and she's wearing only a modern <UNK> and bikini rather than period underwear <UNK> also <UNK> a night <UNK> which he never did in any historical sense br br the direction you could do a better job in the first few minutes law officers discover an abandoned car with blood <UNK> all over the <UNK> there is no body the handsome young deputy sheriff turns to his boss and suggests they search for the victim who may still be in the <UNK> and living the sheriff lacking any motivation shouts at him now you just forget that i don't want you going off half <UNK> on anything it should be no more than a business like exchange of views why does the director have the sheriff so angry characters of diverse sorts listen to radio programs or records that play old <UNK> pop songs louis <UNK> ain't <UNK> for instance this is what rural <UNK> in the 1950s and the characters insist on music that would appeal to customers of the <UNK> club in harlem in the 30s or new york <UNK> like woody allen nope the radio would be playing kitty wheel of fortune or <UNK> <UNK> or equally likely not that the <UNK> between the music and the events adds anything to our understanding of what's going on beneath the images someone involved in the production just liked old <UNK> pop songs that's all br br of course there's only so much you can do with a low budget but it can be light years ahead of this <UNK> see ed <UNK> with steven <UNK> for an example of a much more sophisticated way of dealing with this lunatic and his <UNK> for dead bodies and on a budget that couldn't have <UNK> this one by much br br these comments are all based on the first twenty minutes of the movie that's about as far as i could get if anyone finds this tale to be well executed and fascinating in any way he should try to find some insight into his tastes it's beneath mine and i consider myself pretty <UNK>
<START> like <UNK> in fear of fear falls victim of her ambitious husband like fox in fox and his friends is driven into suicide by his boyfriend who took all his money away like in the wife who goes to prison in order to give his cheating wife a chance to get rid of him like <UNK> <UNK> who seeks <UNK> in insanity in order to flee his stupid wife and <UNK> company so also hans is a victim of the german society after world war ii in r w <UNK> the <UNK> of the four seasons simply from the fact that fassbinder played through social abuse between men and women as well as between <UNK> and homosexual couples it should be clear that he does not any sex br br in hans case there are the women who drive him into despair illness and finally death when he comes back from the foreign legion where he flew because he could not stand anymore the pressure of his mother she complains that he is still alive while the good boy from her neighbor had been killed then hans gets a job as a policeman but is surprised by his <UNK> while he is <UNK> by a prostitute after having lost his job he works as a fruit <UNK> with little <UNK> going from backyard to backyard crying out his produce his mother one of his sisters and her husband are ashamed to have such a street worker in their family the love of his life she has no name in the movie refuses to marry him because his job does not fit together with her social status and origin so he marries whom he does not love and who does not love him from her constant pressure on him he <UNK> into drinking one evening after his wife was stalking him he explodes and hits her she <UNK> to her family for which this event was just what they have been waiting for when is calling a lawyer for divorce hans suffers a heart attack decides to stay with him but from now on he is not allowed anymore to do heavy work and to drink alcohol so he starts to feel more and more superfluous gets <UNK> and <UNK> and more and more <UNK> when he finds out that <UNK> him he chooses to end his life but not like <UNK> <UNK> by having a trip into the light of madness but he drinks himself to death in front of their little daughter and his <UNK> buddies fassbinder said in an interview that hans knew what he was doing the question however is did hans just kill himself because he could not stand anymore his miserable environment or did he make self justice
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is only a so so film i believe it's the fourth installment in the <UNK> series br br i missed the beginning and all i remember from there was some topless women and a box shape thing on a computer screen but using my wit and intelligence and the info button i soon found out that the villain <UNK> was released from <UNK> box which i believe is a <UNK> straight to hell br br so anyways <UNK> somehow comes out of the box and <UNK> the family and that's about it oh and not to mention the random <UNK> of various people that cross his path yawn br br what mainly happens in this film is that <UNK> captures the kid and then <UNK> the dog on his wife and then kills a random person then he husband comes along blah blah blah who cares why it fails is because <UNK> <UNK> is too corny to be scary look at <UNK> of creatures a cheesy dog that looks like it's been turned inside out two men whose heads and bodies are connected together <UNK> twins in a horror film and some person who is supposed to be a princess of some sort i haven't seen the previous films now look at the main villain his name is <UNK> isn't that the name you call somebody when they're stupid he has <UNK> in his head and <UNK> coming out of his fingers and he has blue skin i suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn't have such a corny name and a corny speech somewhere in the film two cops approach him and say don't make us put some pain on you <UNK> replies pain how dare you use that word i am blah blah blah blah blah it sounds a bit cliché if you ask me br br don't forget the final half of the movie the characters and audience get to experience more torture when <UNK> attacks some futuristic asylum some person who we don't recognize maybe he was in the previous films i don't remember him in the beginning of the movie this scene is basically one thing played over and over again br br a guard goes to <UNK> a mysterious noise br br some other guard oh no he's down i will go check on myself br br after he dies the same thing happens again br br spoilers here's the thing i didn't get in the film <UNK> is supposedly sent to oblivion at the end so how does he come back for another four films are they <UNK> why hasn't he died in the previous ones <UNK> the makers need to come up with an idea for a different series end of spoilers <UNK> <UNK> is gory and full of torture scenes but has little thrill or scare value just forget it bad special effects with else make this more of a <UNK> fest than a good horror br br good people may enjoy the topless women in the beginning plus voice is pretty cool i suppose if you like ultra violence you might like this too br br bad none of the reasons above make this a very good film the <UNK> and <UNK> are pretty bad and who names their villain <UNK> br br feel free to send me a private message regarding this comment
<START> this film released in 1951 has the usual elements typical of the westerns released during the 50's the <UNK> needing to protect the territory from a murderous band of indians an officer determined to see that task through and the men with him with various character flaws that he has to <UNK> together into a cohesive unit this small band must hold on to a <UNK> located close to the indian village until <UNK> arrive the indians know all to well that the small band is and could be wiped out before the help comes one major difference for this film only the <UNK> is that it attempts to play out the usual storyline but at the same time deliver the message that duty is a paramount concern to be shared by all even if they don't accept that charge br br gregory peck <UNK> the tight <UNK> captain of the <UNK> that has to prevent the indians from breaking out into the territory the troopers that he takes with him to the small <UNK> are the <UNK> of the <UNK> at the <UNK> they in turn have <UNK> or weaknesses that cause them to wonder if the captain hasn't taken them out because of their general lack of devotion to a cause eventually the captain and the small band confront the <UNK> and at the same time each confronts his own flaw the cast includes western <UNK> such as ward bond gig young <UNK> brand <UNK> <UNK> jr and warner anderson br br a sleeper of a film and a good solid western for fans of this genre
<START> well i don't know much about anything but i sure liked this film in short it was creative humorous simple and heartwarming in other words it was everything it set out to be br br the story is set around a girl's first love as the title suggests and i certainly should warn you expect nothing challenging or provocative in terms of the subject matter here i mean it is a children's cartoon it's really just a simple story but it's told well and it holds your attention well br br in the end it's short it's funny it's cute it's simple it's good
<START> i am a fan of jess <UNK> bizarre style and a lover even of his films and my personal opinion is that he has besides several very entertaining movies also created a few masterpieces such as the brilliant aka <UNK> in <UNK> of 1969 for example it is however an <UNK> fact that the <UNK> movies this highly prolific filmmaker has directed in his career also include a bunch of big time <UNK> <UNK> of 1981 certainly is one of these <UNK> just an utterly bad and plot less movie with the ability to bore the hell out of you in spite of constant sleaze and nudity br br sure the constant nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes but since it keeps going on and on like that one is pretty likely to get bored after a short time the only thing that really kept me watching this was the intensity of the sleaze which is <UNK> spoken slightly amusing br br after couple of <UNK> get lost in the desert on some island they are stopped by a bunch of topless women carrying guns <UNK> of a local prison camp while the husband is <UNK> from the island the wife is taken to the prison camp a place of torture and sexual <UNK> <UNK> by the sadistic <UNK> <UNK> and an extremely perverted <UNK> the prisoners are of course entirely hot chicks most of them <UNK> the <UNK> are entirely topless women carrying <UNK> br br the plot if one can call it that is extremely stupid of course but who is going to watch this for a good plot anyway the only interesting thing about <UNK> is the high level of exploitation even for a <UNK> in <UNK> film there are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see a woman actually wearing a top the sleaze contains all kinds of sexual <UNK> from rape to <UNK> and some of the torture scenes are really nasty br br it is amazing that a film with this extreme level of sleaze however can still be so boring the sleaze will keep you watching in the beginning but after the first 45 minutes i actually had a hard time not to fall asleep it also makes me wonder why out of all <UNK> jess franco chose wilson who was according to most sources a <UNK> who had been born a man well maybe for exactly that reason if you really want to watch this make sure you have enough beer at home to sit through it and watch it for the sleaze and exploitation only and maybe for the slight unintentional fun factor don't expect to be highly entertained however it is almost unbelievable how a movie with such a high sleaze level can be so boring i am a jess franco fan and i always will be but <UNK> is just bad 2 10
<START> it's new year's eve a cop killer in the form of laurence fishburne end up at a <UNK> that's closing down due till snow when the people are <UNK> siege on cops have to team up with cons to survive this re make of the john carpenter classic just had to add a few beyond stupid plot twists take out all the tension and add a horrid john to the cast didn't it the first film was thrilling gritty and a joy to watch this one is more hollywood clichéd and painful to behold the only thing i took from this movie was <UNK> can be very annoying very the ending song is bad br br my grade d br br dvd extras commentary by and jeffrey silver scenes with <UNK> commentary 5 minute armed and dangerous <UNK> on the weapons expert 7 and a half minute behind <UNK> walls plan of attack the assault team 12 and a half minute behind the scenes <UNK> trailers for unleashed white noise seed of <UNK> br br i got this at best buy and it came with a bonus disc including the first 2 minutes of cry wolf a 10 minute first look at unleashed the trailer for that film and a interview with john <UNK>
<START> i suspect this board will soon be full of comments from over emotional people <UNK> dear john as a pearl and a <UNK> ride and all the other vacuous words this film's target audience typically employs br br i am most definitely not this film's target audience but i do not dislike romantic dramas either as long as they are well made so here is my objective take on the flick br br it is not good br br it's not a bad movie either but the plot <UNK> development <UNK> where it should've been moving forward right around the middle to be precise and as for the ending it almost felt as if they had run out of ideas so they suddenly said hey let's just film a last scene real quick put some sentimental string soundtrack over it and end it that way even amanda beauty could not save this <UNK> <UNK> too gave a good performance but you can only do so much with a flawed script br br speaking of the music it is <UNK> predictably and <UNK> from the <UNK> voiced <UNK> high pitched female folk singer <UNK> surely chosen to appeal to the majority of college age girls that will go see this movie to the <UNK> <UNK> strings and piano <UNK> it only <UNK> anyone paying more attention to the film as a whole rather than to his own feelings the film has a good beginning and the major conflict that <UNK> us into the second act were all promising so was part of the second act itself as the story <UNK> then the film just dropped the ball beyond that i'd have to give spoilers br br dear john is not a bad movie but it doesn't work as it should either if you want to see a truly moving film about prolonged love waiting to be reunited go watch <UNK> which was truly superb
<START> the concept is excellent the execution <UNK> the overall quality of the abc network br br apart from peter jones it appears that the rest of the <UNK> consist of marketing <UNK> rather than real br br when i realised that peter jones was getting together with simon my initial thoughts were wow he's gonna take america by the balls but it appears that abc have come along and destroyed the concept br br i was an absolute addict of the dragons <UNK> in the u k and was interested to see that peter jones had manipulated the concept that <UNK> in japan and developed his own show for the states the result is neither inspiring nor informative br br if you lack drama in your life you have a choice jerry springer or the american <UNK> to sum it up a struggling musician selling out to a media <UNK> br br idea get me and i'll produce a show worthy of the title
<START> my cousins and i have watched this movie ever since we were little i don't know exactly what it is about this movie but we <UNK> on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories br br i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch it is an old movie but don't let that fool you this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other
<START> i suppose that in 1997 hollywood wasn't quite at the point of openly celebrating homosexuality so one might want to give some credit to those who put this movie together for having shown a little bit of courage one simply wishes that credit could be given them for having put together a really good movie and in my opinion in out doesn't qualify on that count it's the story of howard <UNK> kevin kline a small town high school english teacher who on the eve of his wedding is by a former student who happens to win an oscar and who then has to go through what can only be described as a period of self discovery as he comes to terms with being homosexual to me that was the first problem with this movie howard didn't really have to turn out to be gay the movie would have been funnier and perhaps even more thought provoking had <UNK> remained <UNK> straight in spite of the <UNK> gay aspects to his life and the town's belief after the oscar speech that he was gay in fact i thought that <UNK> him as gay given the presence of those stereotypes might actually have been rather insulting to the gay community as well as to straight men who like poetry and believe in dressing neatly br br kline was decent enough in the role and largely carried the film aside from him most of the other cast members although fine actors were people not really noted for their success on the big screen folks like tom <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and bob <UNK> are good actors but not big movie stars i actually thought that the funniest if very small role in the movie was that of the super model <UNK> played by an actress named <UNK> harlow speaking of stereotypes i loved her oh so stereotypical model line i promised to do that photo shoot this afternoon i have to shower and vomit in the end what really turned me off about this movie was the ridiculous ending starting with the <UNK> ceremony and to be honest even if someone decided that the <UNK> was really necessary the movie should have ended there rather than <UNK> on with the totally unnecessary <UNK> at the end br br basically i got a few chuckles out of this but nothing more 3 10
<START> hey i'm a fan of so bad so good movies but there's nothing so bad so good about rise of the undead it's just so bad and that's it no redeeming cheese no unintentional humor nothing boring apocalyptic zombie the undead a few people with hardly any make up nonsense with lame special effects if you can call those effects dumb plot and annoying actors they also have the nerve to rip off and quote from other better movies resident evil dawn of the dead night of the <UNK> and managed to put me to sleep on the side however it was rise of my <UNK> once the end credits rolled though my advice save your money it's not even worth a rental unless you want to p ss off and or put some people to sleep then go ahead and give it a spin you've been warned
<START> having <UNK> in western history when i was a student in college seeing the views on world war ii are quite <UNK> and in a whole completely wrong world war ii was the most graphic and bloody affairs to ever occur in world history while the <UNK> powers <UNK> many crimes against humanity which is still the view today and the correct many people forget that not every german soldier was out to <UNK> the jewish population not every japanese soldier <UNK> a samurai sword around and flew <UNK> missions and not every italian soldier was a fascist most of these soldiers for the <UNK> powers were normal people like you and i caught in a terrible conflict and just happened to be fighting for a country they loved br br the battle of <UNK> was arguably the most lethal battles in world history with over 1 500 000 <UNK> <UNK> over the course of the battle the film <UNK> follows a german platoon and its leader lieutenant von as they are <UNK> to the eastern front to battle the <UNK> at <UNK> von acts as sort of the main character with two other men <UNK> and <UNK> they all are normal men and seem to be completely unaware to what is happening back in germany and <UNK> br br the film follows the course of the battle the film is overall very bleak when it comes to its portrayal of combat and a soldiers life during the battle we are shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the battles including a firing squad sequence overall the battles are the earliest examples that i know of that portray the loss of limbs and overall in your face death sequences and violence much of the inspiration for saving private <UNK> battle sequences seem to have come from this film br br the film does not aim to make the completely innocent of everything in the film several of the higher <UNK> officers of the army are portrayed in the usual view most people are use to evil most of the soldiers are just normal people who often speak of home the film makes it clear quite quickly that not all germans were responsible for what happened during the holocaust most of the country and army was entirely oblivious to the fact that <UNK> was taking place the film makes it clear that the soldiers in the germany army was simply fighting for a cause they really didn't understand and most wished just to return home rather than <UNK> in negative degree <UNK> in russia br br the film really shows how <UNK> war is especially world war ii the battle scenes will shock you with its gritty realism and the story is quite easy to follow as you are simply following a platoon during the battle as with most war films do not expect much happiness after seeing it it will leave you in a bit of a depressed mood just from seeing the life most of the soldiers on the eastern front faced not recommended for children br br 4 5 stars
<START> brought philip <UNK> to life in a way that is worthy of the greatest performances of all time and not just the ones that are <UNK> by popularity it shows a stark portrayal of life as the greatest <UNK> poet of his era which is exactly how he would have wanted it such was his disdain for and it dramatically exposes the raw beauty in the intense sadness of <UNK> observations of our relationship with our own <UNK> and lays it our in a way that seems to have missed even the great <UNK> for anyone interested in profound observations of our relationship with life love and death this is a must
<START> i <UNK> thought that this neo noir effort from the buffalo <UNK> falls area might be something different unfortunately i was incorrect there are are many problems with the falls that really have nothing to do with it's low budget video production immediately one has to question why all the constant narration my feeling is that if you have a decent script the audience will follow along without having to be insulted with voice over storytelling the acting is very amateurish which is not unexpected but simply adds to the problems finally the entire thing is annoyingly shot like an mtv music video which i found to be totally <UNK> the narration bad acting and annoying video effects are all good reasons why this should be avoided <UNK>
<START> i've seen a few bad action movies in my days but this one's just plain awful i feel it's a waste of time to even write this but i'll make it short why this movie suck here are 10 reasons 1 very directed and cut 2 bad bad bad acting of the whole cast 3 silly dialogs and too many clichés 4 too many plot holes a lot of scenes don't add up 5 bad <UNK> and a lot of continuity issues 6 ridiculously bad performance by the lead female actress 7 <UNK> action scenes and not too good either 8 even for a snipes movie he shows a big lack of acting <UNK> 9 outrageous accents of all the cast 10 last but not least too many implausible facts such as a <UNK> of soccer in the u s cia needing to do background <UNK> to get new information about their employees a <UNK> that is explosion proof and so on in essence it's a waste of time it's not funny not entertaining not even as a joke don t watch it seriously just don't
<START> terrific production and a good comedic performance by george clooney can't save curiously detached occasionally clumsy quasi comedy from joel and ethan <UNK> depression era road tale <UNK> back to yesterday with three escaped chain gang prisoners seeking a hidden fortune and inadvertently becoming country music stars in the process the film <UNK> along but never builds any momentum it does get a big boost from <UNK> charismatic <UNK> and also from the art direction and t bone <UNK> lively music otherwise the screenplay by the is seriously lacking in humor and interest supporting cameos by john goodman and holly hunter fail to add any lift and the second half of the movie <UNK> <UNK> into self <UNK> from
<START> i must say i'm an avid horror movie fan and currently i can't get enough of foreign horror since us horror really depends too much on gore br br this movie is fantastic this movie reminded me a lot of m <UNK> sixth sense the way the film was directed was great the director took his time to set everything up it took about a good 40 mins just to set the movie up into a horror movie i thought the movie was just a drama this movie just builds up and the pay off isn't too much br br i've never done this before but this is the main reason i liked the movie i actually screamed out loud because one scene just <UNK> the hell out of me which is kinda pathetic but for a film to do that it's great
<START> this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life it is <UNK> the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen everything about it is just bad br br synopsis different situation comes up each week for the parent to handle their kids br br i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and <UNK> joke that you normally see in rated r or <UNK> 17 movie especially for the young boy character where all he does is <UNK> himself is that what one called family show humor the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period br br final word this show is a real torture this show provides an image of how irresponsible parent can be using power wrongly rather than understanding it is <UNK> times away from reality listen to kenny g would be a god sends compare to this watching <UNK> machine <UNK> around wouldn't hurt your eyes as much as this show br br rating 0 10 grade z br br note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show
<START> i must not have seen the same movie as the one the comments refer to here first i think they should have <UNK> ghost story if they were going to film it at all the <UNK> version they come up with was awful i felt the performances were mannered and so much was left out of the story that the performances of such masters as astaire douglas <UNK> and fairbanks seemed hammy alice <UNK> was superb as eva though craig <UNK> is a good actor but he was only adequate as the protagonist the decision to cast patricia <UNK> and to her role was not a good one imagine what anne <UNK> would have done with that character i blame the script which was poor the production values were dark and the pacing was slow a disappointing pedestrian effort br br the book is one of the five greatest suspense horror novels of the 20th century imho but the movie was disappointing although a great introduction for <UNK>
<START> there's no use trying to describe in detail the convoluted overly melodramatic plot involving civil war <UNK> a crooked town boss and other complications it's all bad br br stella stevens andrew bo <UNK> william smith tim <UNK> and lee <UNK> are all good actors that may not be big stars or big stars anymore but always made fun movies br br here they're all wasted on a picture that looks like it was shot in a wild west tourist trap with costumes borrowed from the local high school theater department in fact most of the acting appears to be on the high school level too which might not be so bad if it weren't so pretentious br br the name of ed wood is <UNK> way too lightly these days i think in this case the comparison is <UNK> however i suspect that old ed would have made a more entertaining western than this
<START> this is a classic example of what happens when a sit com is on tv for far far too long everything gets tired and the jokes start getting repeated over and over again ok from the start the first couple of series were quite good you had an entertainment manager simon being pursued by his deputy played by ruth a cleaning lady wanting to become a yellow coat an alcoholic child hating punch and judy man a bent <UNK> and a stand up comedian as said earlier it started well but went on way too long once simon left it went downhill fast you were getting dire story lines and a new <UNK> manager who ruth again threw herself at when a comedy is all filmed in one place there is a limit to the number of jokes that can be <UNK> unfortunately this went on so long every joke was <UNK> 3 or 4 times over if this comedy had been stopped after 2 series it would have gone down as an all time classic as it is it will be largely remembered for the dreadful last few series
<START> matthau is a widowed hospital doctor enjoying his single status and the <UNK> and available <UNK> on the staff whilst colleague and friend richard benjamin looks on with amusement and <UNK> their boss is hard of hearing going on <UNK> chief of staff art <UNK> who is up for re election to that post br br matthau is content playing the field without commitment until he meets single mother glenda jackson who insists upon being the only woman in his life while she is in his life at the same time he comes under pressure to respond to the <UNK> advances of a potential in a <UNK> suit and to support the <UNK> and incompetent <UNK> in his attempt to be re elected chief of staff br br this is a superior old fashioned romantic comedy <UNK> by four grade a actors and an excellent supporting cast working with a first rate dry <UNK> and sarcastic script <UNK> steals every scene he's in and in the <UNK> of imdb has us rolling on the floor laughing out loud whenever he appears on screen we are otherwise entertained by the on off relationship of the two leads and various sub plots br br lacks the ambition to be a great film but remains one of the best of its kind and watchable and re watchable for its comedic value alone deserves more attention than it seems to have received and well worth the cost of the dvd or video <UNK>
<START> it seems that hack has been described as un realistic but that's what tv is tv is meant to provide an escape from everyday life and i feel hack does a great job in that regard add to this the slow process of revealing his past and engaging interesting plots you just can't seem to get enough plus with such great actors as david morse andre <UNK> and even little <UNK> what more can you ask for so if you are looking for an involving experience and have a liking for underdog characters i suggest giving hack a chance especially now that it's finally getting off its feet
<START> i grew up in <UNK> so i was exposed to the films of john waters since i was way too young to watch them and if you're knowledge of john waters is limited to <UNK> or cry baby or other family friendly movies then you must prepare yourself for pink <UNK> br br explicit sex acts incest an old lady who eats nothing but eggs and acts with <UNK> are just a mere portion of some of the <UNK> in this movie the film ends with divine <UNK> 300 <UNK> cross dressing star eating dog <UNK> br br the premise is about two families one a pair of <UNK> trailer trash which includes divine and edith massey as the egg lady and the other is a rich swinging couple both families are competing for the title of <UNK> person alive enjoy john <UNK> finest movie but only see it if you're an open minded individual with a strong stomach because some scenes in this movie will gross you out
<START> there's nothing much to the story a young woman steals some money from the dreary <UNK> supermarket where she works decides to run away to florida where he has dreams of attending school with her friend julie and encounters an odd couple on the highway if you remember the elderly couple from rosemary's baby you have some idea of what these two are like bill has a comical face and is retired from the army sandra is an ex stripper now become a whore although we don't find this out at once they're <UNK> helpful and full of common sense br br they more or less adopt the girl alice and promise to give her a ride in their elaborate <UNK> although they are not driving directly to florida br br this is where the film could have gone one hundred percent wrong all the film makers had to do was turn the elderly couple into the <UNK> of evil they would take the <UNK> alice <UNK> to the bed or whatever and sell her body to any driver who has a lot of money and likes rough sex alice would have had a heck of a time escaping with lots of <UNK> attempts before the final shootout but no the couple really is pretty nice and alice is far from <UNK> alice <UNK> sandra with a <UNK> asks about the business and tries to turn a trick on her own bill <UNK> anything from happening and insists she do the job right if she's going to do it at all they don't talk her into it they guide her br br alice makes several hundred dollars which is several hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple bill and sandra keep her money in the safe where customers aren't going to find it alice <UNK> she doesn't find <UNK> very pleasant work and she thinks she'll never be paid off because every time she asks to be dropped off sandra responds with what not here honey not in the middle of nowhere however after she is talked into <UNK> her gun over to sandra the couple give her the money she wants and rather lovingly release her to continue her trip to florida br br you know what i found the most tragic moment in the film it had nothing to do with prostitution or <UNK> alice has been expecting to room with her friend julie after she arrives in miami julie is after all a legitimate student but when alice calls her friend from <UNK> in <UNK> to assure her she's on her way but will be late julie <UNK> and says well my mother doesn't think you should room with us and to tell you the truth my roommate isn't cool on it either i invited you down sure but i thought it was just like a visit for a week or something go back to <UNK> alice there is a long silence before alice hangs up br br only one shot is fired a few white frames of film and no one is hit tears appear only once nobody slugs anybody else no car explodes in a <UNK> no cop chases them down the <UNK> br br the direction is occasionally clumsy too much cross cutting between sandra trying to <UNK> alice and <UNK> hand holding the <UNK> pistol there is hardly any musical score there is brief male and female nudity and it's awkward as it's probably supposed to be alice isn't unattractive but she is not either she sports <UNK> eyes a kind of <UNK> version of molly parker the cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out the direction is a straightforward narrative with a few <UNK> flashbacks nothing is wasted and it was all evidently shot around <UNK> the city sticks in my mind because i drove through it after one of its <UNK> and remember the cars <UNK> with a film of mud all the way up to the door handles br br i don't know exactly what alice found i dread even thinking that the answer to the <UNK> is that she found herself the acting isn't bad at all <UNK> is better than that it's definitely worth seeing a quiet <UNK> film that treats the audience like adults
<START> infamous for being brought to you by the digital effects team behind independence day is even more of a spectacular failure just from being <UNK> with this ridiculous mess of a film starts off with a brainless premise and goes completely downhill from there a wealthy soon to be married couple in beverly hills are the subjects of this idiotic story <UNK> fiancée has taken off on a business trip right around christmas so she decides to <UNK> fly to switzerland so they can spend the holiday together i especially love that her initial reason for wanting to go was because he had left some documents at home that she thought he might need she grabbed them up and <UNK> after him while he drove away <UNK> that her best bet would be to fly to the other side of the planet rather than call his cell phone i refuse to believe that a couple living in such a <UNK> mansion as theirs were unaware of the existence of mobile phones br br so up until this point the movie is unbelievably bad but check this out this is where it starts to get bad she gets to switzerland and when she can't find her husband she gets some cake and calls her friend to <UNK> about how unfair it all is this woman is not an action hero and she is definitely not a german indiana jones for crying out loud she is an <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> girl whose <UNK> experience is probably limited to digging her spike heels out of the ground when she gets <UNK> enough to wander onto the lawn during a wine and cheese party out on the <UNK> br br she gets a tip that her fiancée is in south america so she like totally flies there to get him once there this moron thinks she's going to go into the jungle by herself <UNK> out the enemy base and rescue her poor helpless boyfriend she laughs off a comment about the danger of going in there then freaks out later because she finds out that there are battles going on you never said anything about battle br br there is one point where claire and some journalist that she met up with drive this huge truck across a bridge that is hundreds of feet high and hundreds of feet across and suspended by two by <UNK> literally there are thousands of thin pieces of wood tied together with <UNK> and these morons decide to drive over it not only does it <UNK> under the weight of the truck but claire manages to fall off of it falling hundreds of feet and landing on her back in the shallow river below later she recalls the event laughing it off like oh maybe it was only a hundred at least she wasn't <UNK> <UNK> on her fingers br br what is truly sad about this <UNK> bad movie is that they even managed to <UNK> a terribly performance out of the tremendously talented john rhys davies a real indiana jones veteran there is a lot of nonsense about an <UNK> at the end of the film where we meet an <UNK> rebel leader who when we first meet him has such a thick accent that he rolls his <UNK> like he thinks he's in a commercial then later he talks like some guy they pulled off the streets of <UNK> beach unbelievable br br the special effects are <UNK> the team that brought you independence day by the very fact that they were involved with was simply going through the motions throwing together some <UNK> and blue screen shots i have to believe because they just had nothing better to do the story is astonishingly bad and <UNK> <UNK> who many other imdb users <UNK> as the only reason to see the film doesn't put the slightest effort into her performance maybe she thought the digital effects team behind independence day could <UNK> some meaning into this mess br br and given how far they've fallen maybe they thought they could too br br they could at least have tried
<START> without saying how it ended it is sufficient to say that the whole thing <UNK> from about five minutes before the end if the standard had been <UNK> throughout the movie would be worth a seven br br one wonders in a way why a woman was added to the cast well not really the premise is a good one the situation the victims find themselves in is pretty terrifying and it's rather well done but you get the impression the makers of the film lost interest towards the end or as a previous <UNK> said they changed writers and handed over to someone else
<START> if christopher nolan had made <UNK> before following then all of the flaws in following would have been <UNK> in <UNK> nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly we were able to tell when it was the past when it's current etc however nolan <UNK> with it a little and it just doesn't work although he had a small budget and couldn't use color which is one way <UNK> worked it was just too hard to <UNK> between time on the dvd is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in <UNK> order i intended to write my review after watching it so hopefully it would make more sense but of course it wasn't working br br you can't blame nolan for not coming up with original ideas a young man bill jeremy is bored so he decides to follow random people on the street he finds one <UNK> alex <UNK> that particularly interests him soon bill becomes friends with <UNK> and goes with him as he breaks into houses and <UNK> them then a <UNK> young blond lucy russell enters and the movie becomes even <UNK> from there br br the ending of following is one of the most shocking endings i've seen sure fight club had an amazing ending but the way that ending played out was amazing i felt like someone had <UNK> me on the head and given me a <UNK> nolan has a thing for making good endings well maybe not i could guess from a mile away and can really <UNK> a great story following may not be the <UNK> to follow or look at but it's such a finely crafted original story with a shocker ending that you'll probably want to watch all of its 70 minutes again br br my rating 7 10 br br rated r for language and some violence
<START> unfortunately house of d is just awful with a ridiculous plot terrible writing some mediocre acting and in fact just about everything else about it is sub par br br tom <UNK> nyc to somehow survive as a lone child in paris and manages to convince the beautiful <UNK> girl he eventually marries that he's french despite a poor grasp of her language she's shocked when years later he reveals his secret to her <UNK> br br he then gifts his tale of <UNK> to his own son and who we are expected to believe thinks that's just the greatest birthday gift a dad can give his 13 year old boy if only such things were so easy david duchovny his own wife tea <UNK> in the role of his mother and strikes out yet again <UNK> makes me laugh as a comic but she's just plain wrong for this role br br one of the problems with that is none of the characters are sympathetic i just didn't give a damn what happened to any of them i did rather hope that robin williams and his trademark child in a grown <UNK> body <UNK> would fall into a village <UNK> but alas it was not to be and we had to endure his <UNK> performance all the way br br anton <UNK> and <UNK> daughter <UNK> were not bad but i suspect the rave reviews others are giving them is simply because they weren't anywhere near as bad as everyone else in this movie they weren't great let me put it that way br br there are so many silly and contrived aspects to this film the <UNK> the catholic school and it's staff of morons the conveniently stupid characters etc that this review would go on for ever so i'll just finish up by saying that house of d is a very poor movie and i'm almost embarrassed for duchovny br br the thing that really <UNK> me is how i was so strongly encouraged by online friends to see this that i traveled a long way to do so br br i would not have been so annoyed that this movie is so bad if i'd just wasted a couple of hours down at the local movie theater but instead i lost a whole day and discovered that my so called friends are either stupid or <UNK> because this is an awful movie
<START> the <UNK> of four seasons was rainer <UNK> <UNK> first shot at mainstream acceptance in a <UNK> career of just fifteen years he managed to create an astounding body of work in film and theater both as a performer and a creative producer actor and director although this movie might not appeal to many viewers the film has much to offer the storyline is fairly straightforward a man is <UNK> from his upper middle class family due to emotional and economic problems and proves unable to control his <UNK> spiral the <UNK> of four seasons is shot with a <UNK> devotion to elegant detail and each set is very carefully designed and constructed every object on set seems <UNK> arranged so as to <UNK> layers of emotional <UNK> many religious paintings and icons <UNK> the walls of the various rooms and seem to speak to desperate quest for spiritual meaning or direction in his life much thought was given to how lighting and color were employed to contrast and enhance the drama several times during the film i <UNK> the frame to marvel at the beauty of the <UNK> composition i <UNK> this film and the print was nearly flawless and second to none fassbinder employs his actors in an almost <UNK> anti style he does everything possible to prevent the actors from <UNK> in a normal or <UNK> manner and this creates a rather stilted effect however by doing so he <UNK> an almost <UNK> to the narrative rather than the presentation of a mundane melodrama the actors almost <UNK> lack of <UNK> forces the viewer to confront the film in a different manner <UNK> film intentionally <UNK> the viewer from easily connecting with the characters' trials and <UNK> you are constantly on the outside looking in this will be a <UNK> experience for many but i found it to be a unique and satisfying artistic adventure
<START> i just saw this movie tonight <UNK> <UNK> 2005 for the first time i wanted to watch it cause i saw the basketball <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and loved that but this was far more heavy going i think it had a good depiction of drugs to an extent i empathize mostly with nick character probably because if i someone i was crazy about was on that stuff i'd want to help them get off it a promising student and <UNK> who spends all his time training and studying well it's understandable that he'd want to try teenage life the crazy side of it and in his efforts as what begins is helping his friend he ends up addicted because he wanted to see what it is all about and because of his horrendous family situation which results in his most tragic death a truly sad film but one flaw i noticed is that you don't get a good enough insight into the damage it does to families but apart from that excellent performances on a truly heartbreaking movie
<START> spoiler this film gives away plot points and <UNK> the ending i hated this film mostly for political reasons but also for moral and aesthetic reasons politically this film <UNK> war and military technology blowing things up real good we are led to cheer as the music <UNK> and the <UNK> use our weapons to blow the to bits and no u s soldiers put their lives on the line so it's a fun war <UNK> there isn't a touch of real human emotion in the film just smug <UNK> people being sarcastic feeling superior and doing whatever they want regardless of the consequences and speaking of consequences the film only makes a few small hits at what the <UNK> of the <UNK> actually led to i had read an earlier draft of this script and it ended on 9 11 with charlie wilson realizing that things had gone horribly wrong but that wouldn't leave the audience feeling good this is a feel good movie about killing and it made me sick
<START> this is truly one of the worst films i have ever seen in my life rod <UNK> who stars as the <UNK> grandfather charlie is in full overacting mode hoping that the more flashy he is the better his performance cue <UNK> sound rod <UNK> is one of the last true film legends and to see him in this film although end of days is the 2nd worst film i've ever seen is really heartbreaking from the bad storyline to the nonexistent direction it becomes clear that the only reason this film was made was that the <UNK> last name ended in the only good thing about this film is that it is so bad it's truly hysterical look for the flashback scene where rod where's a <UNK> el wig from superman and a big black porno mustache one only hopes that his follow up film i believe in america from uber producer kevin will redeem him and leave a good taste in everyone's mouths
<START> with the fairly recent release of carlos <UNK> in the united states <UNK> a limited art house only release it's high time for a re release of this fine documentary on <UNK> this film is a treasure chest of vintage film clips of on american television as well as various other film clips including one of her her mother that could easily <UNK> the most macho man to tears i first saw this fine documentary a few years back when it received the <UNK> art house release it deserved far better fortunately various <UNK> exist of best <UNK> on various budget line <UNK> which are generally available in places such as k mart or best buy or if you do a little searching one can fine some of the original releases either on e bay or one of those distribution services that <UNK> in <UNK> european <UNK> <UNK> there are at least two versions of this documentary in <UNK> the original version with no english subtitles and the u s version in with english subtitles except the european version cannot be played on most u s dvd players due to the pal colour line system not rated by the mpaa but contains nothing to offend
<START> as other reviews have stated there are a few missing videos from this collection but what is on this disc is overwhelming there are two separate <UNK> an original recording and a completely <UNK> new performance version any new music from the residents is welcome and i suppose for a first time <UNK> the new version may be more ear friendly but i prefer the original <UNK> probably simply because they are the originals production of this dvd is amazing new and old videos are all interesting with live performance videos probably the least interesting of what is offered although the snippets of live <UNK> hidden as <UNK> eggs are extremely welcome this is not a <UNK> this is a must own collection enjoy
<START> the production company for this film calls itself <UNK> and that is a surprisingly apt name this very is very entertaining from start to finish which is a shame because a mix of zombie movie and western could have been interesting every time a low budget zombie movie is released it will tend to be for the fans by the fans i do actually consider myself a fan of zombie movies but too many more like this one and i'll be re <UNK> my opinion the film seems to be a rip off of the half decent aussie zombie flick expect instead of just having the lead in a cowboy hat everyone is wearing one but this doesn't make a lot of sense because the film is apparently set in modern times the credits sequence at the start of the movie fools us into believing that we're going to be in for an atmospheric film but when the movie starts properly it soon becomes apparent what we're actually in for naturally there's a fair amount of gore and it is actually fairly well done though the good things i have to say about the film pretty much end there there's a twist half way through which might have been interesting if the rest of the film was overall this is just another zombie movie in a world with far too many zombie movies i don't recommend it
<START> there is no doubt that the trail depicts a truly great event in australian military history the brave <UNK> of australia against the cruel <UNK> japanese army this film fails to take into account the story of the fuzzy or the new guinea natives that the <UNK> used to help them carry out there military <UNK> the film also fails to give a credible account of the australian soldier and his behaviour in this event it is more like an <UNK> contemporary view of what is was like br br again the australian film industry has failed to give this important chapter in s history the film it deserved this is film making at its worst with <UNK> cinematography bad scripting and dialogue no character development and cliché jungle <UNK> scenes br br it fails to <UNK> the audience in any meaningful perspective other than the japanese army were ruthless and cruel murderers of an ill <UNK> and badly trained group of <UNK> fighting in a jungle br br the film failed as most australian films do to attract a significant australian audience in fact they stayed away in <UNK> br br i am not going to join the usual <UNK> garbage of saying its great because its an australian film i say either do a great job or just leave it to some one who knows how this government <UNK> film is just another failure by <UNK> wealthy and <UNK> rich kids br br i am giving it zero stars because its an insult to the <UNK> of these truly great <UNK> and their enormous sacrifice what a shameful waste and <UNK> and i know this review will <UNK> more <UNK> from the movie show crew and most reviewers but i have a right to my opinion and that's what <UNK> fought for our freedom and that includes freedom of speech and the right to express an opinion
<START> i saw this movie on late night tv out of buffalo about 30 years ago and i'm dying to see it again one more time before i well you know the interaction between the main characters after the tiger eli <UNK> captures his prey anne jackson in a <UNK> kidnapping attempt is absolutely hilarious charles nelson <UNK> portrayal of a neurotic university dean or department head is priceless how many films can you name which are able to <UNK> <UNK> struggle for meaning and <UNK> by making you laugh from beginning to end this film reminds us that we are all in that same struggle regardless of class race sex or religion and who can forget the scene of the suburban <UNK> on his hands and knees attacking those few tiny <UNK> that have <UNK> to appear overnight on his perfectly <UNK> lawn
<START> if you want to truly experience the magic of don then check out alien factor or maybe fiend but not this alien factor is actually rather imaginative considering the low budget and it's fairly creepy but which i guess is sort of an <UNK> of alien factor is just plain dumb actors <UNK> through their roles especially mr <UNK> sheriff and the monster is some dumb halloween mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative but kind of stupid looking <UNK> from alien factor a spaceship crashes on earth and there's a <UNK> inside of course who runs around <UNK> people and ripping off arms etc and he has a cool ray gun that he uses to <UNK> people too until it gets shot out of his hand and that's really about it alien factor beats this mess hands down if you really want to see a good don movie check that out instead and rip don 12 2 <UNK>
<START> like most i rented this after i heard the universal praise and despite countless bizarre <UNK> moments along the way i was very interested and entertained through 100 minutes of the film then the two women went to the performance late at night the rest of movie which is another 40 minutes by the way is even <UNK> than the first part and completely <UNK> and dump on what i had already seen then the movie abruptly ends br br <UNK> i <UNK> over to my computer to see if i could buy a clue as to what just happened nothing made sense and i'm a pretty clever guy none of these other user comments made sense even when they say spoilers i still have no idea what they're saying someone's dream not real then what's the point of a 2 hour 30 minute movie if it's not real or is it real i'm forced to make a choice either br br a the movie is a work of genius on a <UNK> level and i'm simply too stupid to understand it br br b the movie is weird for <UNK> sake and just doesn't make sense everyone who loves it is trying to save face and pretend like they get it br br i choose b screw you guys i'm going home
<START> because it came from hbo and based on the imdb rating i watched the first season of this series what a waste the characters are occasionally interesting but mostly cartoon like the acting <UNK> from good to mediocre talent with a s t r o n g emphasis on the latter not only prisoners also viewers should leave all hope at the cell door that this story is believable it's such a load of dung that you will need unusually strong <UNK> to keep watching the violence as with most of the developments in the story is <UNK> and whatever morality is supposedly served up it's of the <UNK> variety if your idea of excellent television includes the the writing acting and overall production quality seen in the sopranos <UNK> or six feet under avoid oz if you want to see a <UNK> for illiterate <UNK> watch oz stuff like this gives edgy a bad name
<START> there's not a dull moment in <UNK> <UNK> it's surprising how much is packed into this short film while <UNK> on a deserted beach after a nude swim a young gay is approached by a girl seeking a light for her cigarette she invites him to make love in a <UNK> area near the beach on returning to the beach they find that all his clothes have been stolen she lends him a summer dress to cover his <UNK> and <UNK> he return it next day he rides his bike back to the holiday cabin dressed as a girl his gay companion is sexually excited early next morning the young man returns to the sea and <UNK> farewell to the girl whose holiday has ended she suggests he keep the dress as a <UNK> of their summer romance it's a light hearted film that captures the spirit of summer holidays by the sea but perhaps not for those who are embarrassed by nudity or homosexual themes
<START> a warning to potential viewers of this experimental film the nature of the imagery and the effects are such that this is one of those types of films that should really be seen on film projected the created by digital <UNK> sucks a lot of depth and adds a lot of noise to already abstract and grainy film however since this movie is pretty much <UNK> in any format i suppose you'll have to make do with what you can br br anyway this most excellent artistic <UNK> comes courtesy of the guy who would eventually give us shadow of the vampire it's a dark and dirty film of the <UNK> of the elements as far as i can <UNK> from the character names through a process horrifying and surreal <UNK> is a very good example of what is known as <UNK> art a <UNK> approach that seeks meaning through the visceral more than the <UNK> br br and visceral describes it not very much stuff happens in the movie technically but the levels of emotion it'll put you through are <UNK> the very <UNK> of some of the imagery creates a mesmerizing catch over the senses the sound editing and score in particular are <UNK> and serve the imagery incredibly well br br fans of this film would do well to check out the <UNK> of short films released through other cinema dvd experiments in terror i ii and iii movies such as these make me more and more certain that the realm of true horror <UNK> in the abstract <UNK> and non narrative rather than in spooky tales of ghosts and axe murderers br br <UNK>
<START> brilliant and moving performances by tom and peter <UNK>
<START> in one of the best of charlie <UNK> short films he places the little fellow in the <UNK> of wwi where he brings his <UNK> <UNK> and endless patience to the <UNK> of <UNK> life where troops lived for months at a time before finally going over the top to <UNK> the enemy and usually to their deaths it takes someone of <UNK> skill as a comedian to make something as dreary as <UNK> <UNK> into such a brilliant comedy but the irony that he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions highly amusing br br like all of the best of <UNK> films short films and otherwise this one is packed with brilliant and memorable scenes such as the scene where he marks off kills with a piece of <UNK> on a board in the <UNK> <UNK> one when he gets his helmet shot off the scene where he and his fellow soldiers are sleeping underwater the opening of the beer bottle and lighting of the cigarette and of course the <UNK> of the enemy all of these scenes are show <UNK> reminiscent of the most wonderful chaplin scenes this one should not be missed
<START> ok it's watchable if you are sick in bed or have nothing else to do the suspension of disbelief required to get through this movie is significant though first in today's modern society do you believe college <UNK> get that committed to someone in that short of a period of time even if you are a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who likes <UNK> kids and the 2 week romance <UNK> into a letter exchange that leads to john's conflict of whether to re <UNK> right after 9 11 <UNK> really he asks her what to do every guy we know was not gonna be sitting on the <UNK> after those towers came down my husband was one of them and i love him and am proud of him for going john's character is so flat he's nearly <UNK> the entire movie he's good looking but not <UNK> <UNK> he seems unsure not confident quiet instead of a hell <UNK> no <UNK> gets into a fight with the <UNK> boys that is nothing more than a pushing match really walks around without a cover on his head nearly the whole movie and there are military technical flaws everywhere <UNK> upside down the war scenes are dumb john and another guy heading off on their own huh then other guy gets shot and john drags him 10 feet and starts giving buddy aid before <UNK> the area or back up arrival or even having their backs against cover it's a <UNK> for god's <UNK> you don't stop fighting until its over heck i wanted to shoot john in the back back home when the truth is revealed and she <UNK> the wine we hated her for <UNK> her shirt in his presence <UNK> break his heart and then <UNK> him into adultery she's a head case best part of the movie is when he drives away from her at least he had some self respect and honor there overall unbelievable story and we generally did not care about these characters or their love dismal
<START> this film contain far too much meaningless violence too much shooting and blood the acting seems very unrealistic and is generally poor the only reason to see this film is if you like very old cars
<START> the only reason i gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 was because for some reason i felt compelled to finish it out basically i wanted to see if there were going to be any aliens any <UNK> anything at all suggested by the title of the movie the cover of the movie and the beginning of the movie i was very disappointed to see religion being thrown into the mix the way that it was this could have been used to the movie's advantage but i felt instead that the movie was trying to send <UNK> messages to me finally how big was this <UNK> wardrobe i became so distracted by the number of different and extremely bright shirts each character had on in every new scene that i began to wonder if this movie wasn't really supposed to be classified under poor comedy br br toe thumbs down
<START> i'm a huge comedy show fan racial humor is always a little <UNK> but the <UNK> like george lopez dave <UNK> lisa etc pull it off perfectly br br they don't go overboard make the audience uncomfortable or <UNK> <UNK> steal jokes but i won't <UNK> upon that br br carlos makes racial humor totally <UNK> his jokes continually scream racial humor to the point were it's not funny or clever but it's insulting i'm not one to turn cold towards racial humor but his execution of these jokes is sloppy that cause people to <UNK> at his comedy br br his humor is only <UNK> by his stage presence in annoyance i feel as though he's screaming at me constantly and he runs around the stage like a maniac it only comes off as annoying
<START> the movie was good really the only reason i watched it was alan <UNK> which he didn't pull off the southern accent but he did pretty well with it know emma thompson did really good she definitely pulled off the southern accent i like all the character in my opinion not one of them did bad another thing i have notice i have read all these comment and not one person has comment on alan 5 shadow which made him look even better and he pretty much had one through the whole movie i would give the movie a 9 out of 10 another one of my opinions is the movie would been better if there wasn't any sex still it was alright love the scene were he says <UNK> sh t when he is setting in his car and see them in his mirror
<START> since i am required to write minimum of 10 lines and this garbage deserves not only a single one i'll start with the following 1 i voted awful for this dreadful so called movie br br 2 let me explain why these <UNK> mr david produces are shot mainly in my beautiful <UNK> <UNK> just in btw for the illiterate people around this country is in europe based north to <UNK> and has absolutely nothing to do with mexico and <UNK> some years ago <UNK> image has <UNK> our country and started making crappy mostly direct to video releases why here because here they pay <UNK> low <UNK> to the <UNK> crew and to the <UNK> actors most of them distinguished ones which are in many ways better than most of their american colleagues personally i am ashamed of that fact the reason is of course the of the americans involved and their wish to get most if not all of the profit actually it <UNK> be so bad if only the production wasn't so filthy and pale there hasn't been a good picture shot here for years at present <UNK> image is being <UNK> here over the very <UNK> <UNK> of our national cinema production centre called films no doubt about it there has been corruption there has been <UNK> there has been a lies in this recent purchase the <UNK> cinema is dead long live the <UNK> cinema
<START> for those of you who have no idea what bug juice is or was it was a children's reality show about real kids living at summer camp bug juice is the show that inspired me to go to camp it was full of romance friendships fights <UNK> your fears and dealing with the struggles of living away from home for 2 months it was an amazing show that is no longer shown on t v regularly but is amazing non the less the show was never dull and always attracted my attention it's really nice for kids who have never been to a summer camp to really see what it's like before going plus disney did a really good job of picking camps to showcase because who wants to see a show that's at a camp for like only a week the length of the camps where perfect for this show and the environment they where in was fantastic they where camps all over the u s that each provided unique activities for the <UNK> it was a truly amazing <UNK> show
<START> your ability to enjoy the <UNK> of time may depend on our expectations before stepping into the theater even its most <UNK> supporters seem to agree that audiences can be split right up the middle in their appreciation of this unique film br br unlike most hk <UNK> the battle scenes are curiously kept at a distance when they do happen they're rendered in a jerky style in which it's difficult to make out exactly what's occurring on screen the dramatic scenes can be <UNK> beautiful with the of maggie cheung <UNK> lin and a roll call of top acting talent chewing up the scenery as with some of wong <UNK> <UNK> early work the dialog could be more precise br br in short the <UNK> of time requires a <UNK> attitude released around the same time as wong <UNK> <UNK> spectacularly successful <UNK> express it's clear that the director isn't as confident working with the elements of the martial arts film anyone looking for tense action is likely to be disappointed but those intrigued by the director's aesthetic will likely find this a unique experience at the very least
<START> this movie was completely stale and uninspired the central premise of this movie was basically a bunch of stereotypical black people sitting around a <UNK> <UNK> painfully unfunny <UNK> i did not laugh one time during the entire movie i could have sat in any <UNK> in america and have heard this banal banter and maybe have even come out with a decent <UNK> i cannot understand why this mess got any <UNK> reviews much less why so many people have wasted money on this none of the characters here were funny or worth caring about i really didn't care whether the rival <UNK> across the street would cause <UNK> to go out of business don't waste your money on this one folks as that is the only way to get hollywood to stop <UNK> out these <UNK> pieces of rubbish 1 out of 5
<START> there is nothing i hate more in a movie than <UNK> and this is one of the most pretentious films ever made it's self consciousness is obvious in every frame see what a profound sophisticated film we are making the director and screenwriters seem to be saying to us and to themselves they say see how we can bore and confuse the audience even more i would rather watch the worst film by ed wood or edgar g <UNK> than something like this at least they were giving us honest trash and at least their films in their own atrocious way were entertaining this film is about as entertaining as a root <UNK> without <UNK> and thus is <UNK> to torture br br have these screenwriters ever heard the word <UNK> ' it doesn't appear so they have a concept they are able to create an atmosphere and they were able to <UNK> an excellent cast and <UNK> good performances from them and for what to bore us for an hour and 45 minutes nothing really happens in this film the only exciting part and this lasts only about two minutes occurs when one of the soon to be <UNK> <UNK> starts shooting at the state employees who come to tell him he has to leave but nothing comes of it too bad he didn't keep shooting until he hit the screenwriters the only redeeming features of this film are the acting and some beautifully photographed scenery toward the end 3 10
<START> i decided i need to <UNK> up my review for my all time favorite film unlike other war films that focus on the event apocalypse now takes the viewer into a psychological head trip the sheer <UNK> makes the body uncomfortable yet you can't lay your eyes off of it based off of joseph <UNK> heart of darkness apocalypse now slowly <UNK> its protagonist <UNK> martin sheen into madness most likely the same way <UNK> <UNK> into insanity the production of this film is notorious for its <UNK> provided by the <UNK> season and for <UNK> <UNK> performance he read his lines from cue cards there is a documentary titled apocalypse now a filmmakers apocalypse which shows the hell everyone went through in making this br br the opening sequence is one of the most famous and popular in any film as the blade of the <UNK> are heard in slow motion and <UNK> is dropped in the trees the song the end by the doors can be heard the next shot is of <UNK> in his bed with the fan on so the noise of the helicopter <UNK> with the fan we are informed that he does special missions for the military mostly <UNK> when his next mission is given to him he is <UNK> <UNK> a man with murder here is like giving a <UNK> ticket in the <UNK> 500 the man he has to kill was a respected colonel that has gone insane and isolated himself along with <UNK> people <UNK> is <UNK> atrocious acts that are carried out by these people and he must me stopped <UNK> does not go alone however he is carried on a boat with several soldiers and they come across several battles along the way they meet lieutenant colonel bill <UNK> about the war <UNK> <UNK> that if is that crazy what could <UNK> be like there are many scenes that portray <UNK> into insanity the tiger attack the slaughter of innocent <UNK> the <UNK> rain the <UNK> dead bodies scattered about and the deaths of his crew members when he reaches the <UNK> compound he is <UNK> by the village people and a hippie <UNK> dennis hopper instead of <UNK> <UNK> right away <UNK> begins talking with him and his conscience begins to doubt what he should do <UNK> on the other hand wants to die he is tired of the war and wants to go down as a soldier <UNK> kills him with a <UNK> while in <UNK> a buffalo is sacrificed with several <UNK> by the people once they realize their leader has been <UNK> instead of killing <UNK> they <UNK> him as their new king <UNK> rejects the offer and leaves them br br the cinematography here is absolutely breathtaking the colors are grain free something that is rare in older movies i can watch it muted and admire the beauty of the scenery br br the acting ensemble is terrific with everyone playing their parts well many criticize brando for some reason but i think he nails his role as a depressed lunatic who is beaten up by the war br br the soundtrack and the score are haunting and provide the mood for the film i am wondering what <UNK> they used in that guitar like sound when the credits roll there have been many parodies of this film but my favorite quote comes from <UNK> simpson when she explains to homer why a character with the same name on a police show is behaving like an idiot your character provides comic relief for the show like um marlon brando in apocalypse now those who have seen the movie know why this is hilarious
<START> i hate films about sports i guess the pre <UNK> hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year what i am trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this genre use exhibit a  the game plan as evidence of this if you want so needless to say i was <UNK> to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element but at the same time i couldn't wait because i love surfing documentaries like step into <UNK> and <UNK> odyssey i took a step i <UNK> into the unknown and to be honest at first i wasn't happy i didn't like the direction the people or the style that the film <UNK> to present these young sport with my first viewing i thought that history couldn't be fully recorded so i thought <UNK> <UNK> was <UNK> stock footage with faux actors acting like they were from the late 70s the music was intense it matched well <UNK> had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment but the visuals were anything but stimulating the <UNK> scenes while using amazing music to support just seemed <UNK> and too long for my attention i wanted to get to know the <UNK> not just watch them <UNK> for ten minutes in an empty pool i wanted a combination of who these kids were where they went during their rise of fame and where they are now it felt like i was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the <UNK> just <UNK> their <UNK> all day i wanted to know the men behind the <UNK> br br then with a thought that i would have another negative review under my belt i watched the film again with <UNK> audio commentary his passion his voice his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished wow ed me this suddenly transformed into the film i wanted to see <UNK> lets us know more of where these kids are today what they are still doing and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera he hadn't seen many of them in 20 years so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface he was sincere he was sympathetic yet he showed so much dedication to this project while i do not agree with everything that he chose to do i e the sean penn mess up is not punk rock he <UNK> this film for me it was due to this commentary that i rate this film much higher than originally thought br br jay adams tony jeff ho peggy these are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned and continually praised if <UNK> is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees while tony <UNK> name sells products it is these guys these mild mannered <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> an entire sport sure others were probably doing it in the stone ages but these guys did it with style grace and moved it to the next level this was a <UNK> for them but it also <UNK> them in a direction i believe none of them were ready for <UNK> and z boys is the story of evolution being in the right place at the right time living in a generation without <UNK> to keep us planted and about friendship we have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity and this is definitely a story that should be added to that i cannot say that i loved this film nor will i but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the <UNK> trend it was sad it was emotional and these guys aren't multi <UNK> over again  they are people with a passion and very rarely do you see that in documentaries br br overall i cannot watch this film again but i will suggest it to friends and family time after time i think the downfall for this film to me was the filming  the attempts to be avant garde with the style which ultimately drew away from the characters and events as mentioned before there were some elements that dragged on too much which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now <UNK> obviously had a passion for this sport for the people but he seemed out of focus at times the music was intense and worked perfectly with the film sean penn while he was decent with his voice over wasn't needed at all they could have spent the money elsewhere on the positive the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing <UNK> voice instead of <UNK> brings a stronger human element to the scene while he tells us better stories of the people places and events watch this film but don't expect to be blown away listen to the audio commentary i think you will be impressed br br grade <UNK> out of
<START> i've read plenty of jane austen in my time and <UNK> of several cinema tv adaptations but this one we just don't need br br rating is a 2 as i wouldn't say it's awful just so boring you will feel like you've wasted 90 minutes of your life dull script matched by even <UNK> acting i've heard <UNK> <UNK> is ok in dr who not a fan so can't confirm but in this she just sucks there is absolutely no chemistry between the leads this is austen it's supposed to be a romance br br please don't let this put you off austen or historical dramas there are plenty of better <UNK> to view
<START> when i attended college in the early 70s it was a simpler time except for a brief <UNK> in 1994 i've been totally free of the influence of illegal <UNK> ever since and i've never <UNK> it until now <UNK> has got to be hands down the best movie to watch when stoned the odd <UNK> state it creates is very strange when you're not smoking anything but i'm sure that it would seem completely normal after a big <UNK> not that i'm <UNK> this you understand the <UNK> narration provided as it usually is in quality cinema by a <UNK> victim trapped in a painting would be ideal to help the stoned viewer to follow along as things get complicated plus everything in the film is pretty <UNK> from old fashioned natural breasts to the bucket of fried chicken br br now there's also no question that the young man with the <UNK> hand problem is absolutely <UNK> away in the film at one point you just know that he's going to say hey when i move my hand it leaves <UNK> trust me you'll know when you get to that point br br the only other thing we have to address is this how good can a film be when at least half the budget was spent on moving a huge bed frame around for interior and exterior shots br br definitely a must see for horror <UNK> but suitable for the general audiences under the right conditions if you know what i mean and i think that you do it only earns four stars because i can't actually say that it took any talent to make
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is my favorite western second only to the <UNK> with john wayne i watch <UNK> <UNK> about every 6 months and never get tired of it i have read all the <UNK> books although i cannot remember much of <UNK> moon i too looked forward to this mini series and decided to tape it on our <UNK> so we could fast forward through commercials unfortunately i messed up and didn't record the first part but decided to watch the other parts and try to pick up br br there is nobody that can ever compete with robert duvall or tommy lee jones and i was expecting to be disappointed and i was br br although there were so many things that didn't ring true the most apparent to me was when <UNK> died the day before and gus was out on the range it switched over to clara writing him a letter from <UNK> telling him how sorry she was to hear of her death how in the world could she have known the next day way out in <UNK> additionally it was supposed to be 7 years later after her leaving and her children looked to be about 6 7 years old maybe a little younger yet more time went on before they actually moved to <UNK> <UNK> and in <UNK> <UNK> they had been there about 10 years or longer before leaving to montana when they stopped at <UNK> in <UNK> which probably took another 6 months on the trail the girls looked to be about 10 13 since they were playing in the yard like little children the <UNK> just does not add up br br i agree that the man who played gus had a lot of his mannerisms and looked a little like gus may have looked as a young man br br i am also a little confused about one thing the captive white girl that they brought back was she the one they captured when they <UNK> austin they said she had been captured 25 years ago but if she was the one captured in austin it was only 7 years later when this took place in the movie was she captured earlier i remember seeing a captive girl after they <UNK> the town and don't know if this is the same one if someone can explain since i missed part 1 if it had been 25 years she would probably be over 40 years old when they found her since she looked to be grown lying on the ground also the way they were <UNK> her when they captured her it is hard to believe she would have lived to go on to be married and having indian children br br i have to admit though nothing is worse than john voight playing call in the sequel to <UNK> <UNK> or the unbelievable marriage of to <UNK> eye in the sequel to <UNK> <UNK> which was never explained either also the way he killed <UNK> off was i hear from spite for them doing the sequel with john voight without his <UNK> br br if anyone can clear up these <UNK> i would appreciate
<START> i'm sick and tired of people complaining that never say never again is just a weak remake of <UNK> yes that movie's influence is <UNK> but the tremendous and almost universal <UNK> of re made films is reserved for such <UNK> and <UNK> films like the 1998 re make of psycho while it's true that the opening theme of the <UNK> and <UNK> last bond film is one of the worst of the entire series the film itself still manages to stand on its own despite many other weaknesses besides that even the weak title song is made to blend pretty nicely with the closing dialogue in the film br br sure sean connery was getting a little on in age when this movie was filmed at least by james bond standards but there is plenty of evidence in the narrative that makes it clear that this was not exactly unknown to the filmmakers james bond is near retirement before he is handed his assignment having spent most of recent time teaching not doing and there is even the tongue in cheek <UNK> from m that he pay more attention to his health <UNK> and training and getting more exercise and <UNK> besides this is james bond remember this guy is supposed to be some kind of super human and all of his fans are getting all upset because he's got some gray <UNK> when this guy <UNK> at the end of the film m sends poor small in a hilarious cameo from <UNK> <UNK> to tell bond that without him he <UNK> about the safety of the free world and all of you people can't get over the fact that he's not a <UNK> young man anymore come on sean connery could still play james bond just as good as he ever could or at least better than anyone else ever has been able to br br the majority of the film deals with the elaborate plan to steal nuclear <UNK> and hold the world hostage as dr evil would say oh hell let's just do what we always so there's clearly not much new there but this is one of the bond films that had the better one liners there's the amusing scene where bond is asked for a <UNK> <UNK>  if you could just fill this <UNK> for from here ' there are a lot of good one liners but the sexual <UNK> aimed at mr bond are especially prevalent in this installment but then later he happens to throw that very <UNK> <UNK> into a <UNK> face making him scream as if his face were burning off not a very good attempt at comic relief especially since this guy had been kicking <UNK> ass with some sort of super spring device that could cut through pretty much anything and of course kim basinger stars in this film as one of the best bond girls of the entire series br br it's no secret that never say never again has dated badly and one of the things that has dated the worst is the special effects  with the one exception of the flying <UNK> which were obviously fake but still impressive for 1982 the colored contact lens at the beginning of the film was totally without effect and the laser watch was one of the worst things in the entire movie second only to those damn sharks evidently <UNK> put some sort of device on his <UNK> tank that attracted sharks granted they did have weird <UNK> <UNK> of their own in a scene that more than likely inspired the classic line i have one simple request and that is to have sharks with <UNK> laser <UNK> attached to their heads ' and then of course there is the exploding hotel room scene which was <UNK> in an episode of the simpsons and which was obviously followed by another obligatory and overly casual one liner from james br br the <UNK> video game created by <UNK> the film's villain is an especially memorable scene and the film also boasts what is probably the best motorcycle chase in the entire series far to superior to the laughable one in tomorrow never dies but despite many strengths the film's weaknesses are left <UNK> in the audience's mind at the end of the film due in large part to the <UNK> underwater conclusion one of the more obvious parts borrowed from <UNK> and <UNK> never mind the fact that <UNK> revealed some crucial information to bond as he left him in the tower alive dr brilliance once again i'll just leave him there without actually witnessing his death and just assume everything went to plan what ' the climax of what is expected to be a fast paced action film should never take place in a muted underwater atmosphere br br all in all never say never again ranks very highly on the james bond scale and <UNK> <UNK> at the end of the film as well as the two closing lines suggested at the time that he may still return for another turn as bond clearly this is no longer very likely so we can only hope
<START> <UNK> miyazaki has captured the imagination of audiences young and old across the globe and his most recent cinematic work of art is a children's fairytale <UNK> on story elements from the little mermaid of course like other miyazaki classics such as spirited away and his last film <UNK> moving castle is full of a creativity that can only be truly appreciated by adults but this it is distinctly more a children's story than those recent efforts it's a magical story best described as beautiful and lovable aiming for charm instead of conflict br br is the story of a bug eyed childish looking fish of the same name the daughter of an <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> to escape the sea and become a little girl when she does she quickly befriends a young boy named in the process she <UNK> a strong magic and <UNK> throws the world out of balance between land and sea and a giant storm <UNK> most of the cliff top town where lives with his mother and it threatens to end the world br br like <UNK> moving castle walt disney picked up for an american release and dubbed it over with an impressive selection of western voices even choosing <UNK> products in the youngest siblings of disney band the <UNK> brothers frankie <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> younger sister <UNK> to voice and respectively also <UNK> characters are liam neeson <UNK> father tina <UNK> lisa mother matt damon father <UNK> <UNK> sea <UNK> mother and a trio of hilarious elderly women are played by betty white <UNK> <UNK> and lily <UNK> the effort is definitely there to make this film appeal to american audiences and disney is getting close br br but voices are of little significance in a miyazaki film which is all about visual creativity a fan of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and fluid motion creating a fairytale taking place partly underwater must've been a joy for miyazaki to work with and maybe even his entire motivation for choosing this story among the highlights are of water that <UNK> sends after that move like living waves as well as a variety of other magnificent sea creatures and breathtaking storm scenes make as as any other miyazaki film br br as a children's story however concentrates its efforts on being adorable the discovery of true friendship and love between and is heart warming even if <UNK> <UNK> shouting <UNK> when <UNK> <UNK> human life can get a bit annoying but as delightful as many of the imaginative elements and loving relationships are there's very little <UNK> or danger past miyazaki films have clear villains but the conflict in actually <UNK> as the story goes along believes he's lost his mother at one point and in the background is the idea of the world going out of <UNK> and that humans should be ashamed of <UNK> the sea but is mostly tension free most <UNK> its climax is <UNK> despite how overall likable all the characters are br br will surely satisfy miyazaki's fans in every way with its imagination and <UNK> will still be smitten by his simple yet visually ambitious storytelling but this is distinctly more of a children's movie best for families and others who love fantasy regardless of its form or target audience it's not quite what you'd expect from miyazaki considering his recent work but it's sure to be remembered as another of his beloved stories steven c br br visit my site at http <UNK> <UNK> com

<START> ok i just <UNK> channels and caught i watched it knowing it would be trash but as a person who has seen tons of films this one stands up there as one of the most purely bad films i have ever seen i'm not kidding it is so bad you have to watch it like a bad accident you can't turn away from sometimes these kinds of films work ie troma movies but watching martin <UNK> and charles bronson <UNK> it up like this is painful what's even funnier is i pulled up imdb to see what other people said and it actually scores a 4 1 10 i can't believe it made it past 1 5 equally as funny is this is not even the <UNK> of this series somehow this garbage <UNK> part 4 and 5 and to top it all off some <UNK> comments on here <UNK> this as the best of the series and his favorite film of all time statements like that scare me about this world

<START> years before pre <UNK> became a regular thing ernest lubitsch made a screen comedy on which they are the basis <UNK> wife involves gary cooper as a multi millionaire living on the french <UNK> who's been married seven times and now marries <UNK> <UNK> for number eight but <UNK> a good sport about it he always <UNK> with his ex wives for a 50 000 00 a year as per an <UNK> they sign before marrying him sounds like what we now call a pre <UNK> br br of course <UNK> wants a lot more than that and she feels cooper takes an entirely too business like approach to marriage she'd like the real deal and is willing to go some considerable <UNK> to get it br br <UNK> wife has some really funny moments the original meeting of cooper and <UNK> in a men's store where cooper is <UNK> he wants only tops and <UNK> looking for only <UNK> and of course my favorite is <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> the detective cooper sends to spy on her herman bing has the best supporting role in the film as that <UNK> detective br br i've often wondered how back in the day hollywood could get away with casting so many people who are non french in a film like this of course cooper is an american and <UNK> of the cast is the only one actually of french background though david niven is charming as always having him be a frenchman is ludicrous he is <UNK> british br br nevertheless <UNK> wife is an enjoyable film and a great example of what was called 'the lubitsch <UNK> back in the day
<START> all in all this is a movie for kids we saw it tonight and my child loved it at one point my kid's excitement was so great that sitting was impossible however i am a great fan of a a books which are very subtle and hide a <UNK> intelligence behind the <UNK> quality of its leading characters this film was not subtle it seems a shame that disney cannot see the benefit of making movies from more of the stories contained in those pages although perhaps it doesn't have the <UNK> to use them i found myself wishing the theater was <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and too instead the characters voices were very good i was only really bothered by the music however was twice as loud in parts than the dialog and <UNK> to the film br br as for the story it was a bit preachy and <UNK> in tone overall i was disappointed but i would go again just to see the same excitement on my child's face br br i liked laugh
<START> fantastic documentary a movie within a movie i'm so glad block <UNK> on after his mother's death makes one wonder about the time and money spent in therapy what might have happened if she didn't have that <UNK> did the <UNK> help her or just foster a <UNK> that kept his bank account <UNK> the audience needs to understand that divorce was less of an option in those days she was a housewife went to therapy instead of going to college or job training she seemed to feel trapped by the situation i wonder if the <UNK> ever tried to get her to think about what she could have done to change her situation and free herself meanwhile wife 2 was just the opposite she was out there working with his dad ended her bad marriage supported herself and appears to be a very confident giving person whatever the state of the marriage the <UNK> did something right in raising 3 kids who could look at their parents' story be ok with it and share it with us and maybe lead us to start conversations with our parents and <UNK>
<START> for a movie that was pg this is one fun film i grew up on watching this film over and over its really fun i don't know how today audience would react but if you grew up on it or loved the 80s then this is a great film stephen <UNK> is great as harold who i think is one of the best characters in the film paul also pops in for about 10 minutes i love nostalgia
<START> this <UNK> of won a award they must have been desperate for giving out an award for something this movie <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> stuff and it made me sick thankfully i watched it alongside <UNK> mike and the <UNK> so it made it bearable horrid acting unsettling mother daughter moment silly premise if you want a bad movie here it is be warned though watch it with mike and the <UNK> or you will suffer br br 1 out of 10 i still can't believe it won an award and the director is defending this piece of movie
<START> i saw this on zone horror and fully expected it to be compete crap like most of the films they play however i was pleasantly surprised the film revolves around 2 friends and a maniac in a monster truck who is chasing them i know it sounds crap but its actually quite good the film is creepy when it <UNK> to be and is laugh out loud funny in parts and not in an unintentional way either it is well paced and is a lot of fun as well as being very gory there's some very funny black humour thrown in as well its not the most original movie but so what if your after shakespeare then this is not it if your after a fun movie then this should be fine
<START> im usually <UNK> of movies <UNK> around the 6 10 mark on imdb id like to think people know what they are talking about and know what they like i guess the trick with reviewing is to take an approach of hey if i liked types of movies like these would i give it a higher score than i am about to give it now since i don't like these types of movies then again people judge differently <UNK> more value on acting or perhaps story or directing anyway landing the plane here i had rented this movie out before and hadn't had time to watch it this morning i did br br wow see this movie i am personally interested in the <UNK> have read a bit about near death experiences so automatically i was hooked i am unsure about some of the comments here saying that a quality cast here was wasted i disagree the acting here was superb from all i think this is the only time i didn't mind julia roberts it was good to see <UNK> sutherland currently at the time of this review serving a jail sentence for <UNK> and kevin bacon sporting an interesting hair style br br overall i liked the direction the atmosphere the acting and the story line most of all particularly the idea of <UNK> and to quote nelson wright everything we does matters so true br br 10 10
<START> i was 12 years old when i saw the original film i lived in italy and the italian title was fbi operation cat that was a fun film and not just for kids this awful remake it's pathetic even for a 5 year old what possessed disney to ruin their reputation and the memory of a lovely film i don't know and i just can't believe it even the title song in the original film both original version and the dubbed italian version was extremely nice and creating the mood for the story on this remake the title song is even worst than the movie itself it was just nice to see dean jones even if for just a cameo appearance he was a regular on the great old disney's films i cannot honestly see anything else positive in this remade movie
<START> i can't believe that i let myself into this movie to accomplish a favor my friends ask me early this april 14 2007 this movie certainly a pain in your ass in theater and <UNK> boring i haven't even felt the gory impact of its <UNK> scenes which i <UNK> to be complete failure to attract its audience the worst even <UNK> me cause my friend failed to come on time at the theater because she was busy <UNK> her boyfriend in looking for an appropriate <UNK> to stay in for one night i wasn't really disappointed with that matter but this movie is a matter indeed for me poor plot useless storyline <UNK> created and i don't know what to say anymore br br the title doesn't suggest anyway the creeps and horror it failed to <UNK> us viewers maybe the beating of the animals could get more the creeps if they show it in theaters the real <UNK> play good luck to anyone who attempts to watch it anyway
<START> could someone please explain to me the reason for making this movie sad is about all i can say this movie took absolutely no direction and wound up with me shaking my head what an awful waste of two hours <UNK> should be ashamed of himself for taking money for this piece of garbage
<START> thomas edison had no other reason to make this film except to show that film can capture the <UNK> of an innocent elephant edison was not a genius but a man out for money and profit his love for life was <UNK> by dollars not experiences as this film shows
