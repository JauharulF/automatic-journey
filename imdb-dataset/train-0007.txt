<START> this wonderful 1983 bbc television production not a movie as others have written here of the classic love story jane eyre starring timothy dalton as rochester and zelah clarke as jane is the finest version that has been made to date since it is the most faithful to the novel by charlotte <UNK> in both concept and dialogue br br a classic becomes a classic for very specific reasons when film producers start to <UNK> with a <UNK> very <UNK> then that classic is destroyed thankfully the producers of this jane eyre approached the story with respect and <UNK> towards the original which results in a spectacularly <UNK> <UNK> that is worth viewing multiple times to enjoy its multi layers of <UNK> and delight and suspense the performances are delightful the music is just right even the gothic design of the house and <UNK> shots are beautiful and set the right tone for the production br br my only criticism though slight is that this version like every other version ever made of jane eyre ignores the christian influences that built jane's character and influenced her moral choices in today's modern world a woman in jane's situation wouldn't think twice but to stay with rochester after finding out he had an insane wife and was still married to her oh just get a divorce she would say to her man or she would live in sin with him but jane eyre knew she couldn't settle for this course in life and respect herself why this decision was based on the <UNK> of the christian faith she had been taught since childhood not from the brutal <UNK> <UNK> institution but from the christian example of a true friend helen burns who was <UNK> rather than not turn the other cheek someday i would like to see some version depict these influences a little more fully in an adaptation a classic novel that ends with the heroine writing even so come lord jesus should not have the <UNK> of that faith stripped out of it
<START> i can see where the film makers were going with this but they never really reach their destination it's supposed to be a homage to spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame but unfortunately it fall short in its attempt it doesn't have that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for the characters are not vile and desperate enough like their italian western counterparts and failing these two points it lacks the humor of a successful parody in fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film but upon <UNK> realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously unfortunately they also missed the humor mark by a mile a whole <UNK> bad movie
<START> how many times do we have to see bad horror movies with a killer in a scream ripoff mask the plot of bleed is kinda original but the movie itself is a complete failure for one thing the dialogue is poorly developed it's boring and wastes too much time on trivial details the acting is bad et <UNK> i want my money back this rental stinks worse than a <UNK>
<START> <UNK> drive made me the definitive fan of david lynch he's a modern genius because he's not only a film maker his stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen so the straight story was quite a surprise to me with its easy to follow storyline and sunny sets still lynch is there and while this is far from his best it's a film not to be missed late richard <UNK> performance is one of the reasons br br 8 10
<START> <UNK> <UNK> 1975 is the <UNK> brothers bizarre documentary of jackie <UNK> kennedy <UNK> aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down 28 room mansion on east <UNK> long island <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> witty and dry and her daughter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> emotionally about 13 a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future live in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and <UNK> in the attic they <UNK> themselves by <UNK> all day listening to the radio or singing to each other they dont even own a television their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special although obviously dysfunctional people one of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today
<START> now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly i'm appalled for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then i'm afraid i don't know what the world has come to let me tell u something i started watching many t v shows like lost prison break <UNK> <UNK> and even invasion but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season then we have the sopranos i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season and more importantly all of its episodes there is no department that this show doesn't <UNK> in acting nothing short of superb james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it would've been the better choice however after watching the first few episodes i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony the raw emotion he displays is superb then we have everyone else edie <UNK> michael <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dominic <UNK> whom i remembered as johnny <UNK> in the godfather part 2 and my personal two favourite characters tony <UNK> and steve van <UNK> paulie <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> all of these actors perform to the best quality and all giving an excellent performance in each episode then we have the story never have i been so sucked into a t v show before the story is nothing short of excellent each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show not just say its too violent or they feel that the character of tony is <UNK> i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day i don't think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god i <UNK> everyone to watch this show because believe me you'll be hooked from the very first episode i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show hooked on it trust me when i say that this show is a <UNK> compared to the crap that comes on t v after you've watched the first season you'll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show <UNK> television and no t v show current or future will ever <UNK> the marvel that is the sopranos
<START> by 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it still instead of <UNK> the project and saving us from having to watch it they went ahead and made it anyway apparently in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film they decided to make it as blatantly violent and unpleasant as possible hell it worked for the wild bunch so why shouldn't it work here of course the wild bunch had the benefit of a superb script but the script of the last hard men is plain old fashioned rubbish br br it's hard to figure out what attracted charlton heston and james coburn to their respective roles heston plays a retired <UNK> who goes after an escaped bunch of <UNK> led by a violent outlaw coburn the hunt becomes even more personal when <UNK> daughter barbara <UNK> is kidnapped by the <UNK> and subjected to sexual <UNK> br br this is a <UNK> film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over the top detail it's tremendously disappointing really because the star pairing sounds like a mouth <UNK> <UNK> there's no sense of pace or urgency in the film either it takes an eternity to get going but when the action finally does come it is marred by the emphasis on <UNK> all in all this might be the very worst film that heston ever made i'm sure it's one of the productions he is <UNK> to include on his <UNK> <UNK>
<START> wendy wu <UNK> warrior has a very good strong plot but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie i am a younger teenager and didn't enjoy this movie very much i thought the effects were horrible but they might seem entertaining to younger children the matrix moves ruined the action you know that it was absolutely fake then there was the <UNK> lo an evil spirit who <UNK> possesses random people and <UNK> in which wendy was <UNK> to win it all ends like a typical feel good movie when wendy and her <UNK> monk cousin <UNK> defeat <UNK> lo and destroy him forever in the end so wendy learns a lesson blah blah blah i'm ready for the next <UNK>
<START> the honey i <UNK> the kids franchise was a huge deal and not to mention very famous i loved honey i <UNK> the kids when i was little it was an original story and had such an exciting plot the sets were so amazing and the cast seemed like they enjoyed each other's company now honey i blew up the kid was pretty stupid so i think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved br br basically adam is a little more grown up now and the mom's are going on vacation to leave their husbands with their children but when wayne's favorite item is threatened for the garbage he wants to shrink it and keep it but he and his brother get in the way but when the wives come back after forgetting to give some <UNK> to their son they get caught in the machine as well leaving the kids in the house alone br br the plot is silly but like i said it was just a family film that i think some might get a kick out of the original honey i <UNK> the kids is the best i think everyone could agree the third one wasn't so bad i would recommend this one at least over honey i blew up the kid movie it was at least a little more fun br br 4 10
<START> i agree with one of the other comment writers about good story good actors but <UNK> and i would also say rushed it has been about <UNK> since i read the book as it was in school but i felt that you would need to know the story of jane eyre when watching this one as bits are left out therefore it doesn't fully make sense for example jane mr rochester have hardly spoken suddenly he is <UNK> marriage the actors don't have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story the actors are good but aren't given enough time to do this story justice i'm sorry to say it but i didn't really enjoy this version the 1970 version with <UNK> york george c scott would be the jane eyre movie of my <UNK> but you should check out the 1983 bbc mini series version with zelah clarke timothy dalton in the 2 main roles i love it so much i watch it regularly there is an <UNK> version which goes for <UNK> or the full version for <UNK>
<START> this picture for me scores very highly as it is a hugely enjoyable and amusing spoof of alien <UNK> taking over a town and many of its' men folk br br the town and the players are all <UNK> out in sort of 1950's style and the whole movie has a deliberate tacky and <UNK> feel to it some of the scenes are hilarious like with the birth of an alien creature br br all the actors give full blooded and serious performances which makes the film even funnier and the special effects and aliens are at least it seems to me intentionally 3rd rate to add to the amusement br br these type of films often deserve a cult following br br 8 10
<START> i was able to see this movie yesterday morning on a early viewing pass br br i am a mom of 2 children who range from 11 down to 6 so i'm sure plenty of parents can relate to having to see many many kids movies this was refreshing for me i haven't read this particular book so i don't know if it stayed true to the book or not but it sure took the <UNK> factor to a high level this is the story of the new kid in town and it just so happens that there are a group of boys who have formed a club of sorts and love to pick on kids sound familiar haven't we all suffered this one time or another he has the little brother who he cant stand and parents that he is embarrassed about what i enjoyed most of all was seeing how each character was totally different from another they all stood out the bully why do they always make the bully a red head my daughter has red hair and she is no bully lol is well a great bully who finds himself being <UNK> at by his own big brother it took twists and turns and well you fall in love with all of them and really find yourself <UNK> for all the characters even the parents great connection between father and son all around enjoyable sweet funny gross etc take your kids you will enjoy it as much as they do
<START> in short the movie had a little bit of a weak 1st act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and pacing somewhat of a decent 2nd act that managed to build some tension and intrigue despite some inconsistent pacing and some inferior performances by the cast and the 3rd act there virtually wasn't any 3rd act br br regarding the 3rd act the movie just abruptly ends there is no resolution and no path down from the climax of the 2nd act so there wasn't much of a 3rd act the bad guys die and that's that the end credits roll there is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters and so on the audience would've likely left the theater after the movie asking that's it a real letdown br br music was composed by david bell which worked adequately enough to serve the film most of the time but it's certainly nothing outstanding it's just <UNK> but achieves this by being merely generic and derivative it is also apparent that the score is very dated with the use of <UNK> <UNK> for some of the <UNK> what least impressed me about the score is that some moments of tension <UNK> music <UNK> sounding like they were ripped off of james <UNK> from 48 <UNK> and <UNK> particularly the <UNK> br br in all the film had potential as the basic story itself is good but the execution was lackluster with mediocre direction weak acting and somewhat inconsistent pacing br br there was virtually no 3rd act to properly finish the story and this <UNK> is major and unforgivable as it doesn't allow the movie to end <UNK> this could either be the screenplay or possibly the production had to cut out filming or editing the 3rd act into the finished movie due to budget constraints but i'm <UNK> as to why there isn't a 3rd act whatever the reason the abrupt ending really hurts the movie overall br br this is good for a view if you're curious and you can get the movie for very cheap as well as to learn the reason why you need to have the 3 acts beginning middle end if you write screenplays and make movies br br otherwise you might not want to waste your time unless you can get the mst3k version to at least get some laughs out of it
<START> i want to add to the praise for the production of this film especially the <UNK> cinematography <UNK> <UNK> off of smooth and <UNK> skin creates stunningly beautiful imagery the film was nominated for and won a single oscar the first given for editing <UNK> performance is moody <UNK> and powerful
<START> philip k <UNK> movie and a decent one for that matter better than the paycheck woo and that abomination called minority report spielberg but lets face it the <UNK> and <UNK> ending was a bit too much for me half way through the movie i already started to fear about such kind of ending and i was <UNK> right but that does not mean that the film is not worth its time no not at all first half as already many here have commented is awesome there are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that <UNK> is highly important thing in the future we will do such kind on corny sf things because we can or is it simply over combining but the paranoia is there and feeling out of joint also good one
<START> my husband and i enjoy the <UNK> as much as our 8 month old baby does we have bought him dvd's and <UNK> just so we can watch and listen to them ourselves they are fun energetic and very entertaining they encourage children to be active share and care they always have a positive message along with fun entertainment every time our son hears the theme song he quickly turns his head toward the television and starts <UNK> up and down in excitement dee dee is a wonderful singer she has a great voice moe is a great dancer i would recommend the <UNK> to anyone with children our favorite song is the bird song you just can not help but smile and want to dance when you hear it
<START> <UNK> the most part this movie feels like a made for tv effort the direction is ham <UNK> the acting with the exception of fred <UNK> is overwrought and <UNK> denise crosby particularly delivers her lines like she's cold reading them off a cue card only one thing makes this film worth watching and that is once gage comes back from the <UNK> there is something disturbing about watching a small child murder someone and this movie might be more than some can handle just for that reason it is absolutely bone chilling this film only does one thing right but it knocks that one thing right out of the park worth seeing just for the last 10 minutes or so
<START> this film is really something of a <UNK> egg good in parts in contrast to other reviewers i found that the main fault with it is its inability to draw in the viewer's interest in the characters and the plot i sat through it because i'm interested in <UNK> and the dynamics of bands but if i were to <UNK> it purely on the basis of its merit as a movie i would have to give it the thumbs down with a few <UNK> jason <UNK> is good in the part of john <UNK> and quite convincing as a rock singer the narrative regarding his childhood trauma is unclear although we are given hints in <UNK> well acted relationship to his parents but his behaviour is ultimately bizarre to the viewer which it shouldn't be nevertheless the idea of using a stage persona to solve inner conflicts is interesting albeit not novel nor fully explored as a theme in this film the <UNK> to john lennon were irritating but i confess i'm not a beatles fan at any rate <UNK> and his band reminded me more of <UNK> than the beatles in the sense that there was something derivative about them another frustrating thing about the movie was the way it opened up with some interesting albeit <UNK> and high school level philosophical <UNK> of the lead character but left the threads of his thinking there only to pick them up again in the middle of the film very briefly when <UNK> says before god there was music ever seen that ad for <UNK> maria in the 1990s before time there was <UNK> maria that's what <UNK> to mind anyway it seems an idiotic conclusion and the viewer has no idea how he reached it but he's entitled to it fortunately his <UNK> and friend played <UNK> by dominic <UNK> seems to acknowledge the <UNK> of this thinking when he responds you don't know that br br in all the limited strengths of the direction and the plot could go either way on future projects into pointless <UNK> or into an interesting and more mature perspective
<START> decent enough with some stylish imagery however the tiny budget <UNK> things br br i also get the impression they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic weirdo <UNK> website stuff br br if you like anime in particular stuff like <UNK> city and the ad police then this might up your street br br but basically its low budget matrix cash in however not totally devoid of its own style br br great soundtrack by some <UNK> of <UNK> punk post <UNK> bands worth checking out if only for the soundtrack
<START> this subject matter deserves a much better script and final result than this movie serves up the script is full of holes because it was never conceived as a story but rather a string of nightmare scenarios loosely <UNK> together the gaps and loose ends in the story line are numerous the scene where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead and have been looking for her since she was taken is just bizarre it is written as a <UNK> therapy moment with the head of the shelter for <UNK> <UNK> her a missing poster from when she was eight in the real world if the head of a shelter for <UNK> found out that he had under his roof a solved kidnapping what would have followed would have been an immediate call to the police it's a law <UNK> issue not a 12 minute segment for oprah everything that follows from there to the end is so short <UNK> that i can only conclude that the first 90 minutes was for pure gratuitous exploitation funny that's what this movie is supposed to be <UNK> in the end it seems to have joined in
<START> this is amazing looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors when it came out over 15 years ago it stunned audiences with its color scheme being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film those colors for me at least make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch there are literally thousands of scenes i wish could freeze and somehow <UNK> them to a painting to study for their artwork br br the characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography but they are all over the top especially the villains the famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing <UNK> <UNK> lips <UNK> etc br br meanwhile warren beatty and <UNK> <UNK> are good as dick <UNK> and girlfriend tess <UNK> and she's as sweet and soft as her name another good addition is charlie <UNK> as the <UNK> young boy dick and tess take under their wing the colorful other characters are played by al pacino dustin hoffman william <UNK> paul sorvino mandy <UNK> <UNK> and other names you know but are too numerous to list here check the full credits on the main page and you'll amazed br br the only <UNK> i found were <UNK> voice which <UNK> on you after awhile <UNK> off key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better <UNK> about 10 minutes those faults are all minor because overall this is a fun movie a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly colorful fashion like nothing you have ever seen
<START> a big surprise probably because i was expecting it to suck the reviews were pretty <UNK> of it even though they all seemed to agree that the concept was golden a man finds out his new girlfriend is a super hero and finds when he wants to break up with her that she's kind of a psycho i kept expecting it to fall apart but it never really did sure it doesn't make as much of its awesome premise as it could and chooses to be short when it might have been better to expand the film's universe but i can't blame it for that uma thurman is great as the <UNK> superhero g girl and i've discovered after several years of <UNK> him that luke wilson can be absolutely perfect when cast as a <UNK> he's given two of the best comic performances of 2006 the other in the pretty much <UNK> <UNK> i absolutely <UNK> up at the expressions on his face when he and thurman first have sex it's one of the funniest sex scenes ever my only real complaint is that they make g girl a bit too much of a psycho like almost unbelievably so maybe with some background i could have accepted it better i can forgive its flaws though because i had a really good time watching it underrated for sure
<START> this was an excellent 2 part episode although i had never been seen the older ones i never thought the doctor would go up against anything that is <UNK> extra <UNK> of course but not <UNK> br br this episode brings the things that we most fear and how would we humans in a futuristic time would fight and defeat real live evil when most odds say that would be impossible br br being that it's a family film i am surprised that they brought some stuff in like fear and faith especially if its also going to entertain american audiences but who care about what <UNK> say we rock doctor who has shown potential ever since from episode one from the new series in 2005 first being so harmless to scary from fun to serious from light to darkness i hope many old fans will one day soon say the old doctor who has returned br br 10 out of 10
<START> here are some examples of pat <UNK> <UNK> claimed relatively good track record on <UNK> br br in his widely reported comments from the january 2 edition of the christian <UNK> <UNK> the 700 club during which he predicted that there would be very serious terrorist attacks and mass killing in the united states in the second half of 2007 host pat robertson <UNK> that he had a relatively good track record on earlier <UNK> but a review of <UNK> 2006 new year's <UNK> <UNK> that claim he predicted for example that br br president bush is going to <UNK> wrong br br the fall <UNK> will be <UNK> but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the <UNK> in charge wrong br br the war in iraq is going to come to a successful conclusion we'll begin <UNK> troops before the end of this year way wrong br br further as a january 3 associated press article reported robertson has a history of making dubious <UNK> br br the <UNK> predicted in january 2004 that president bush would easily win re election bush won <UNK> of the vote that fall beating <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> of <UNK> wrong br br in 2005 robertson predicted that bush would have victory after victory in his second term he said social security <UNK> <UNK> would be <UNK> wrong yet again br br he claims to speak directly with god if so god has quite the sense of humor watching pat make a fool of himself again and again
<START> david lynch's 1999 film of john roach mary <UNK> story is set in <UNK> and <UNK> some time well before the film's eventual release br br we come into the life of alvin straight richard farnsworth late on in life his medical condition is poor his life is mostly behind him and he knows it br br this makes what he decides to do even more remarkable and endearing he decides and at every point in the film his own name <UNK> through his actions to put a few things straight br br alvin is by this time in his life a man of great experience but modest means his daughter rose sissy <UNK> struggles with a speech <UNK> that makes communication a great effort on the audience's behalf but it's worth it because <UNK> story cannot help but come out as the film progresses br br this film is the story of a journey but like all <UNK> it is a journey in the <UNK> sense and in the human sense early on in the film we begin to understand that this is an ambitious journey which no elderly gentleman of <UNK> age should reasonably <UNK> br br but along the way we slowly learn how alvin has so many <UNK> which <UNK> him to achieve his unlikely objective his objective is very simple and straightforward his brother is ill and likely to die and he wants to visit him he has had a falling out with him many years ago and they have not spoken in a very long time br br along the way alvin meets many people the way he behaves towards them and the benefit they get from having known him is the essence of this film we come to know who alvin straight is from what alvin straight does and at the end of the film we know who we are better
<START> this film was made and cast from my home town i remember the fuss about it and the whole <UNK> about the fact molly <UNK> was in town br br storyline br br essentially 20 years after a film was laid to rest without being finished a group of film students set out to complete it with dire consequences it would seem someone does not want the film completed br br the storyline is flimsy one has to remember that this is a comedy and therefore has to be taken a little <UNK> in cheek but it had no real <UNK> the characters are mostly <UNK> and the little info that you <UNK> about them you just don't care about it seems irrelevant it is weird hearing <UNK> accent as australian again and nice to see a kid i went to school with in a starring role but that doesn't redeem the film at all goodness knows why the makers thought they would get in molly <UNK> perhaps due to the nature of the film it sort of pays homage to 80s films bad horror films but really an aussie actor would have done just fine br br as far as casting is concerned a lot of the acting seemed <UNK> some of these kids especially the two main <UNK> they played director and producer looked like they were trying to act that is never a good look also the shots had a rough feel about them over lit perhaps just not as smooth as one is used to br br the killer lord could it be less frightening there are some shock factors though and a couple of gross scenes i did like the film but it was not great it went for 90 minutes but could have gone for less perhaps if they had <UNK> the script it would have been better they had a lot of characters get killed but no real build up to them getting <UNK> maybe if they had killed less people and actually concentrated on a scary atmosphere it would have been better br br now i know it is a comedy and elements were funny or so <UNK> they were funny but i am not convinced br br <UNK>
<START> being a fan of the first lion king i was definitely looking forward to this movie but i knew there was really no way it could be as good as the original i know that many disney fans are <UNK> of the direct to video movies as i have mixed feelings of them as well br br while watching the lion king <UNK> i tried to figure out what my own viewpoint was regarding this movie am i going to be so <UNK> about the lion king that i will <UNK> at certain scenes or am i just going to accept this movie as just another look at the lion king story most of the time i found myself <UNK> the latter br br the lion king <UNK> definitely has its cute and funny moments timon and pumbaa stole the show in the first movie and definitely deserved a movie that centered around them people just love these characters my favorite parts of the movie include the montage of timon pumbaa taking care of young <UNK> and the surprise ending featuring some great cameos br br i could have done without many of the bathroom jokes though like the real reason everyone <UNK> to baby <UNK> at the beginning of lion king 1 i guess those types of jokes are for the younger set which after all is the target audience i don't think many kids are really concerned about disney's profit <UNK> on direct to video movies br br however i will say that i was somewhat annoyed when they directly tied in scenes from the original movie to this movie i'm just too familiar with the original that those scenes just stuck out like sore thumbs to me something would be different with the music or the voices that it would just distract me br br as for the music it wasn't too bad but don't expect any classics to come from this movie at least <UNK> had the nice <UNK> love will find a way as for the <UNK> it was well done in this movie nathan lane and ernie <UNK> did a great job as always and even new cast members the classic comedic actor jerry stiller and julie <UNK> best known as <UNK> simpson did a great job also you can even enjoy these great voice talents even more by checking out the virtual <UNK> on disc 2 of the dvd that feature is definitely a lot of fun br br so all in all the lion king <UNK> isn't a perfect movie but it's cute and entertaining i think many lion king fans will enjoy it and appreciate it for what it is a fun lighthearted look at the lion king masterpiece from our funny <UNK> perspectives br br my imdb rating 7 10 my <UNK> grade b good
<START> basically the movie might be one of the most mesmerizing titles made by either of the two <UNK> <UNK> and tony let's make it straight the movie deserved its hype as one of the most stylish <UNK> thriller ever made br br when it comes to disgruntled tragic heroes denzel washington and tony <UNK> really make a perfect duo both this movie and <UNK> <UNK> are better thrillers you can expect washington really got very comfortable in the shaky cameras and every <UNK> scenes in the movie one would easily be related to his character's emotions therefore enjoyed all the killings on the road it's a success that they created a super dark mexico city with a lot of <UNK> happening one would be easily convinced by the extent of corruption depicted in man on fire i don't know what would the <UNK> think when they watch this br br well let's face it again it's among the best of the death wish genre but it also suffered from extensive amount of violence it's a bit annoying that they justify the actions of a vigilante by making the movie very realistic and let denzel washington play the missing sheep type of tragic hero in the end they even had the <UNK> shot in his own swimming pool like a documentary i was checking on imdb if the movie was based on real events for that so that's for your consideration if you also finds the movie's theme is a little bit phony br br at the end i hope one would not take this movie for real br br 8 10 for art direction editing cinematographic denzel washington
<START> this film is about the life of queen victoria during her youth and her first few years as the <UNK> of great britain br br the young victoria has amazing production every scene is designed and <UNK> to <UNK> detail the <UNK> costumes lavish locations and beautifully <UNK> gardens all make the young victoria very impressive i was the most amazed by the thoughtful cinematography how every person is placed in relation to the background or <UNK> is well thought out every scene is well composed the scene that strikes me the most was when victoria talks to melbourne melbourne was <UNK> in the middle of the door frame from victoria's angle while from <UNK> angle victoria was <UNK> between the space where melbourne held his arm on his <UNK> br br story wise it is far too <UNK> to be followed and understood by a person without historical knowledge of queen victoria many events are rushed through or not even explained i expected a grand scene of the <UNK> and <UNK> it only lasted for a few seconds br br overall the young victoria is a good film and it would have been even better if it was longer so that events could be properly explained without rush
<START> oliver the musical is a favorite of mine the music the characters the story it all just seems perfect in this rendition of the timeless classic novel turned stage musical director carol reed brings the broadway hit to life on the movie screen br br the transition from musical to movie musical is not an easy one you have to have the right voices the right set the right script and the right play all signs point to yes for this play it almost appears that it was written for the screen br br our story takes place in jolly old england where a boy named oliver manages to work his way out of the <UNK> he winds his way through the country to london where he meets up with a group of juvenile <UNK> headed by <UNK> the smart talking quick handed pick pocket the leader of this gang is named fagin an older fellow who sells all the stolen goods br br but all is not well in london town when bill sykes played by oliver reed and his loving girlfriend nancy get <UNK> up with oliver fagin and his young troops and the law what ensues is a marvelous tale of love affection and great musical numbers br br whether or not you like musicals or not one listen to these tunes and you will be <UNK> them all day long oliver is a triumph on and off the stage and is a timeless work of art
<START> i read the reviews of this movie and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it i'm a big <UNK> and art film lover but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something arty or intellectual into something it is not i will be blunt it contains scenes of sexual <UNK> that i never ever wanted to actually see obviously the piano teacher has some major psychological issues but i really did not want to see them displayed so <UNK> the film is in essence disgusting i mean when i saw <UNK> for a dream i was <UNK> by the last sort of scene with jennifer <UNK> but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and <UNK> i felt during this film
<START> the story is being told <UNK> there are no <UNK> the flash backs are woven into the present <UNK> casting was superb young <UNK> looked very much like <UNK> would have looked at that age her portrayal of a blind person was done convincingly director daniel <UNK> have done a superb job in getting the various actors to work together in this story the cinematography is very good you feel like you are with <UNK> and <UNK> walking toward the ocean to the edge of the cliff the english subtitles follow the <UNK> script very closely it is interesting to note that even though out of sight is not a direct translation of <UNK> <UNK> both names are very appropriate to the story
<START> there is a lot of crap coming out of hollywood lately br br a friend sends me movies now and again as a surprise it's awesome br br i turned it on and couldn't stop watching it is a drama but with a odd twist imagine if romeo as in <UNK> had a super power it is sad and poetic at the same time hollywood should take notice of the new russian cinema they are telling stories that are not about big explosions and cgi it takes a simple basic premise and tells a story without a spectacle this is a lot like an asian film with a dark russian twist granted it's not perfect but nothing ever is you know what the power is but it is never explained nor totally realized until the end it becomes secondary to the emotion of the story i don't want to see a remake it is too cool as is the hollywood system would as usual mess it up acting is top notch all around directing and camera work are far above most of the crap that is out there kudos to all involved and i will turn a lot of people on to this independent epic a br br if you can find i watch it
<START> a far as b movies go scarecrow is one of those that are so bad that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through a lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck he then chases the kid out into a nearby <UNK> and kills him apparently the kids soul was <UNK> into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers this scarecrow aside from having a snappy one liner for each of his victims can also do matrix like <UNK> through the air and kill people on <UNK> in broad daylight also why did he always look like a <UNK> corpse just like the two needless sequels that followed this this isn't even worth a laugh
<START> this movie features an o k score and a not bad performance by david <UNK> as dr <UNK> the beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the special effects that this is a low budget movie there is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist horror comedy or low budget movies not special for any nude scene buffs or bad movie lovers either this movie is simply here anne <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are nothing to get excited about as well if you are curious as i was and can actually find this you will realize the truth of the one line summary
<START> i've heard about this movie for many years and finally got a chance to see it a massive murdering of <UNK> back in 1963 and 1969 eventually cause a <UNK> camp to close up fast forward to 1982 and <UNK> a former student opens it back up with new <UNK> among them candy carol kane glenn judge <UNK> and sandy <UNK> scott one by one they are murdered by the killer until only one remains it is then when we find out who did it and why br br also in the movie are tom <UNK> doing a terrible accent as a canadian <UNK> and paul <UNK> doing his pee wee herman <UNK> the plot overall isn't very well developed and quite lame but some funny scenes do occur namely the house of bad <UNK> and the strip poker scene the ending seems like it's thrown together which is a shame br br overall good for about ten or fifteen minutes total the rest you can just fast forward through maybe catch it on tv but it's not worth buying
<START> when my sister said this movie was gonna be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny basically the movie is made of a weird girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts will don so she can go but its not all that easy in this movie you will come across hilarious humor a witch a book of spells <UNK> a mentally challenged uncle and a dog you will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyways i hope you run right out and try to find this really old movie hope you like it in total i will have to give it a 0 no i'm totally joking ill give it a 9 hope you understand that you will laugh you will scream and you may just be offended br br love yours truly <UNK> you can email me at <UNK> loves it hot mail com if you wanna
<START> poor performances by sinatra martin and <UNK> grossly underdeveloped supporting characters annoying talky with no real plot ending leaves you <UNK> than a <UNK> with more loose ends than you could tie up in four sequels that is if you even cared about these wooden characters <UNK> is the only real asset that <UNK> sequence in which the chicago hood <UNK> for the sinatra character is laughable the music in that sequence also is poor and in the final scene when <UNK> character <UNK> his hat for the woman he called a pig almost made me go outside and find a stone to throw through my television screen
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> notorious composer and producer of slightly trashy pop hits like you're my heart you're my soul felt the need to tell his story and <UNK> he decided to hire a ghost writer the result was a funny book about his life well more or less a fuzzy image of it he didn't deny that he is a selfish <UNK> but the whole story was twisted to fit his image of himself no word that he has probably beaten up his former wife and she ended up in hospital however it was written in a funny style and a huge success after his appearance as jury member of the german version of american idol especially his unforgettable comments br br this should be the end of the story really in the hype of the mentioned idol tv show called <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> superstar <UNK> <UNK> somebody must have come up with the terrible idea to make a movie out of the book the result is <UNK> der film br br i have rarely seen a movie which tries so desperately to be funny and fails so completely none of the gags really hits the point <UNK> voice and style of talking was getting on my nerves right away although <UNK> voice should have done that more obvious childish predictable and lengthy gags destroy any motivation to watch this movie to the end within a few minutes the content of the movie is a sloppy film adaption written <UNK> down by a ghost writer based on <UNK> sloppy <UNK> memory they could have used this freedom to do almost everything it was supposed to be a satire but they failed the story is totally uninteresting and the fact that the background voice is <UNK> himself <UNK> that the whole film has nothing satirical at all br br it's no wonder that it was considered to bad for a cinema release the <UNK> that this thing would have rotten in some archive was quite high until recently when the current season of <UNK> turned out to be a mediocre success with the friendly help of <UNK> biggest yellow press newspaper <UNK> and the desperate situation for the tv station <UNK> to have something in the program while the still <UNK> show <UNK> <UNK> is running on channel 2 the movie finally arrived in television unfortunately br br watching this movie is a waste of time there are certainly better cartoons with much more fun and a story actually worth looking at br br therefore 2 10
<START> wonderful actors br br lousy script and not too great direction either my main problem was i simply didn't care about any of these people not the killer not the victims the settings were pretty drab dennis <UNK> character was so poorly written in i didn't even care when the end came he got his kid back big deal i wanted my money back
<START> what to say about this movie well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into <UNK> students that sell more of the bad drugs to people two of those people have <UNK> effects as one turns into a toxic <UNK> type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the <UNK> basement that is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for <UNK> minutes this movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever though that is not fair some people like <UNK> movies and they can watch it if they want troma movies for me though are the worst movies there are out there i just watched this one out of morbid curiosity
<START> what do you do with a 14 inch <UNK> porn star who was involved in drugs and murder and then died of aids you make a movie of course the <UNK> reason why it wasn't made earlier is the fact that eddie <UNK> would have been in the way of its production so it's no coincidence that the film was made just a little while after <UNK> was sent to prison br br the best thing about the movie is its quick pace there is no time wasted on unnecessary crap and why would it be there is too much good material here to require dull filler scenes the cast is good kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies so here was finally a role quite suitable for him <UNK> is cute so it's irrelevant how she acts she's solid and mcdermott who is otherwise quite annoying is rather good to a large extent because he is wearing so much facial hair that i didn't recognize him at first i wish they did that to cruise in every movie so i wouldn't have to watch his dumb face i utterly failed to recognize christina <UNK> and wouldn't have known she was in it had i not seen her name in the end credits <UNK> is charming as ever a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role btw friends is the worst tv sitcom of all time the only casting choices that were questionable were an early near cameo by carrie <UNK> and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s moron <UNK> <UNK> you thought i'd include paris hilton too didn't you no i think hilton is the ideal choice in her 10 second appearance as a dumb whore because the film is about <UNK> among other things  and about a porn actor  she fits in perfectly
<START> the movie was watchable while <UNK> was on the screen however i had to fight against passing out from boredom when the film <UNK> on meryl streep to carry scenes without jack she was as bland as could be the relationship between the characters was nothing special these characters have been portrayed before and much better it felt like a based on real life scenario in the absolute worst sense 90 of daily life is boring and not worth writing about or watching why <UNK> felt her life and relationship with carl <UNK> was interesting enough to write about escapes me perhaps she wrote it as therapy for many writers putting an episode from their life on paper is <UNK> fine but then why anyone in hollywood felt this story was worth filming remains a mystery to me
<START> for those of you who think anime is just about giant <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> think again there is a totally different side to the japanese animation <UNK> japan is one of those shows it is a sweet natured tale of a young boy with the gift to make delicious bread his universe is all about creating a japanese bread that can match with the famous european <UNK> the show is as wacky as they come and i'm sure that non japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes but it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show br br in the world of <UNK> it is not <UNK> for people to look like they've just had an <UNK> after eating bread the bread is <UNK> and can give the <UNK> a wide array of super powers from time traveling to swimming like a fish that weird aspect makes it into one of the least predictable and funny shows i've watched in a while
<START> watching der <UNK> <UNK> berlin as a teen in the late 80's was a profound experience for me so this was what the movies could be along with paris texas and until the end of the world it still holds a special place in my heart and mind a testament to the genius of <UNK> <UNK> br br unfortunately later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with million dollar hotel and land of plenty hitting a terrible low point gone are the captivating pictures or music no search for or display of great insight all that is left are characters and <UNK> <UNK> political statements that <UNK> down to nothing but clichés and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience br br has the well run dry whatever the reason it's time for mr <UNK> to either step it up or stop altogether
<START> this movie is good it's not the best of the great cg kung fu flicks but its pretty good first thing first the story is actually good the whole idea of gods vs fallen gods type deal with super powers is pretty cool my problem is <UNK> too many characters it got very confusing when they switched scenes the special effects were incredible the fighting scenes were very fast paced and complex this movie practically all computer generated the acting is superb as always expected from such high profile players <UNK> <UNK> makes an excellent protagonist loner character zhang <UNK> did nothing for me in this movie i thought she would have a bigger part but she did one fight scene and a whole lot of <UNK> the bad guy the whole skull army and the whole blood cloud thing is very frightening the music is also excellent to me this story deserve at least a mini series and not just one movie <UNK> too much story to <UNK> in 2 hours maybe if there was a book or something i would be able to keep up with all the characters and the details this movie sacrifices story integrity for action i <UNK> storm riders over this any day
<START> i really looked forward to seeing <UNK> after seeing <UNK> amazing debut work <UNK> of fate i had read that <UNK> was generally considered his best silent film so i had high hopes sadly this felt like a huge step backwards br br catherine <UNK> is the main problem with this film her acting is over the top even for a silent film her acting is more like what one would expect in a film from the early teens not the late <UNK> she usually has the same face which reminds me sorry to say of someone with <UNK> pains it was also very difficult to believe that any man would fall for this femme fatale there was nothing charming about her at all br br the film was also quite long drawn the camera work was uninteresting aside from a shot of a horse race and the editing was dull the story reminded me of <UNK> <UNK> box it is interesting to compare the two because there are only 3 years between these films <UNK> box simply scores on every level where <UNK> fails br br this film is only for <UNK> <UNK> or very serious silent films buffs
<START> i've given up trying to figure out what version of this i'm watching the <UNK> at the end <UNK> 1983 and though this is not the important bit of my <UNK> to this film i will say that watching a film obviously made in the <UNK> age including long haired hippie chicks and <UNK> station <UNK> but with a 1980s <UNK> soundtrack is unsettling extremely unsettling br br my main <UNK> here is how dare the filmmakers bury cute as a button pamela franklin alive how dare they br br seriously she's all like adorable and stuff but in the two movies i've seen her in this <UNK> and the otherwise excellent legend of hell house they kill her off br br i would like to put the film industry on notice pamela franklin has apparently retired from the business but if she ever decides to do another film and some <UNK> <UNK> of a director attempts to kill her off i shall ask him to step outside br br no one beats up on pamela franklin and gets away with it i am quite cross the fury has been unleashed br br for b movie fans seeking out a <UNK> you could do much worse than this on the plus side this is not a film which involves <UNK> in a <UNK> and <UNK> way this movie is a hardcore satanic film br br wall to wall satanic <UNK> <UNK> hallucinations a ludicrous rat attack what else could you ask for br br this excellent stuff is quite nearly ruined by the <UNK> <UNK> on 1980s <UNK> soundtrack which is about as <UNK> to a film as it is possible to be the soundtrack reminded me of something you'd hear on the <UNK> it's really bad br br also they made pamela franklin <UNK> her charming english accent which was also quite rude if not a cruel atrocity against the viewer such as you might find covered by the universal <UNK> of human rights i say that we have a right to hear pamela franklin speak in her own voice who's with me i could forgive everything else about this film if they didn't abuse pamela franklin and so i throw the <UNK> down <UNK> anyone who <UNK> with pamela franklin <UNK> with me br br even in a fictional context br br good day <UNK>
<START> here's a movie with a good cast and nice looking location work but it just don't have it director richard brooks must have been a little bit tired at this stage of the game how much better his the professionals was the horses and the rest of the action seemed to be in slow motion even during the non slow motion scenes this film needed to be <UNK> up if anything that horse <UNK> sure looked awful phony to me and the obvious tire tracks in those desert tracking moments just lazy sloppy work too bad the actors did ok but i've certainly seen all of them do better ben <UNK> always a joy though i first saw this flick almost 30 years ago was disappointed then and remained so upon second viewing 30 years later
<START> good action and interesting plot having seen the original i must say it was an interesting improvement and showed more of the movie good cast meaningful acting although it would nice to see some more <UNK> in the action scenes rather than the background story fun movie to watch and keeps you alert all the time 7 10 is a right vote i think
<START> not the worst movie i've seen but definitely not very good either i myself am a <UNK> player used to play <UNK> a lot and going from woods to <UNK> is quite a large change the movie portrays similar <UNK> first of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this phantom guy or whatever they appear to be a professional team and wear <UNK> and shoot <UNK> <UNK> one guy sporting a <UNK> not much wrong with the movie but more how it's perceived it was very cheesy a bunch of kids who are the good guys are <UNK> players who don't appear to have much money and have dreams of getting better guns another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah the phantom helps these <UNK> kids out and trains them and all this crap he gets them to play <UNK> and basically <UNK> all the teams including the professionals br br so what exactly is wrong with the movie well the budget is a huge thing a <UNK> movie wouldn't be bad but the budget is pretty low and the movie feels like it was done by an amateur there are no big names in this film and the acting is very cheesy the perception of <UNK> is pretty bad too they seem to imply that everyone is going to <UNK> and all this other crap it just was a lousy movie in my opinion and doesn't give a real perception what <UNK> is to be honest real <UNK> isn't all buddy like it's a lot of <UNK> and bonus <UNK> not respect and playing by the rules don't watch this movie and then expect to go to a field screaming 4 is 1
<START> add to the list of caricatures a southern preacher and <UNK> a torch singer sophie tucker a dancing chorus and the mills brothers it only makes it worse br br <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> performers who themselves often appear in films to be <UNK> themselves and their race though the <UNK> comedy may have been accepted in its day it's extremely offensive today and i doubt that it was ever funny though i wouldn't have been offended i don't think that i'd have laughed at the feeble attempts at humor as an 11 year old white boy however i might not have understood some of it
<START> i picked this one up on a <UNK> from the library and was very pleasantly surprised lots of tight <UNK> camera work an equally tight script and two superb actors all <UNK> together to make one very fine piece of film not for the <UNK> <UNK> brain but rather the true <UNK> of cinema if hollywood ever does get its <UNK> hands on it i'm sure it will ruin it a choice treat all the way around other posters here have more than <UNK> sung its <UNK> so i <UNK> bother <UNK> their <UNK> just take their advice and mine and don't miss this gem call it what you like i call it two hours of entertainment well spent read my lips don't miss it
<START> for a fan series i must admit that hidden frontier is not at all that bad but reviewing this series can not be based on whether it is a fan series or not the <UNK> in itself is commendable the creativity as well i <UNK> these are people with ordinary jobs and a big enthusiastic heart for star trek but doing all this work pulling all these resources taking all this time and still all those flaws br br first of all the acting and the lines are awful for most the dialogs belongs in a 70's military show not in star trek the captain mr <UNK> looks like he is about to burst into laughter anytime and most characters are just reading their lines the directors should be aware of the fact that <UNK> is not just a word in the <UNK> but i also guess that the series are made in the manner of two takes <UNK> who directed many of the <UNK> episodes and movies also i could not help but think that most of the actors are typical <UNK> without going any deeper into that <UNK> br br my biggest concern regarding the whole project is the quality of the releases when they first decided to spend so much time and resources on this series why didn't they make it available in decent quality using the quick time format with low low resolution is a waste of talent even the <UNK> episodes is considered bad quality compared to the standard quality series are released in using <UNK> <UNK> with a larger resolution and file size would have improved the experience <UNK> if band with problems was the issue setting up a <UNK> <UNK> would have solved that br br let's hope the crew decides to brush the series up and perhaps release it on dvd giving it the quality the project deserves
<START> when originally screened in america in 1972 'the night <UNK> became the highest rated made for t v movie in history based on jeff <UNK> <UNK> novel it told how a <UNK> <UNK> reporter named carl kolchak the late darren <UNK> discovered the existence of a vampire in modern day las vegas when it arrived on british television four years later it did not quite have the same impact but my friends were talking about it at school on monday morning as indeed was i we all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen br br i did not know of the existence of 'the night <UNK> until it turned up nearly a decade later i t v who screened the <UNK> movies had apparently decided to pass on the spin off series they felt <UNK> jones' starring buddy <UNK> to be more of a draw and anyway viewers might confuse <UNK> with <UNK> for years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in <UNK> magazine i could not even purchase the jeff rice novels br br then something wonderful happened in 1990 b b c 2 put out the show as part of a late night friday series devoted to the supernatural called <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> by richard <UNK> <UNK> found himself <UNK> shoulders with the likes of 'the brain <UNK> and <UNK> vs the <UNK> the opening titles were <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the closing credits well there were none br br the first episode screened was <UNK> i cannot say i was overly impressed but stuck with it and am i glad that i did br br i really wish i'd seen it in 1974 my twelve year old self would have <UNK> it creepy humorous exciting no wonder it fired chris <UNK> imagination br br the show's biggest asset was of course <UNK> unlike the recent kolchak the original was an <UNK> figure <UNK> dressed rather conservative he was to the supernatural what <UNK> was to crime the late simon <UNK> was great too as <UNK> bad <UNK> boss tony vincenzo the scripts <UNK> with wonderful dry wit i found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror when the twenty episodes ended i felt <UNK> br br 'the x <UNK> came along a few years later and filled the void but only to an extent i wanted kolchak and vincenzo back i am glad that the show was never <UNK> though without <UNK> it would not have been the same br br i have the rice books now and have read them several times i was very surprised when stephen king <UNK> the first in his book <UNK> <UNK> as it is as good as anything he has written br br alright so some of the monsters were hardly state of the art but so what the new <UNK> totally missed the point of the original what you don't see is sometimes more frightening than what you do br br best episode <UNK> in the <UNK> worst episode 'the <UNK>
<START> i couldn't believe that this movie dates from 2007 it had all the looks of a below average seventies horror flick didn't they have any knowledge of modern special effects or cgi didn't they know that in the post millennium the violence in a supposed horror and or scifi movie should at least be a little bit graphic or did i get the purpose wrong was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal bound together in the big cycle of life or a warning to mankind not to mess with nature or something like that it doesn't really matter either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts br br first of all the premise is very improbable if at a given time you're capable of replacing a total eye no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time that's totally <UNK> and to do all this apparently without informed <UNK> of the patient and why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans and make the victim look like a freak by the way i noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy like normal dark eyes couldn't they have waited for such a <UNK> the story is lame it's about this poor guy aaron who gets these weird eye <UNK> which suddenly makes him feel like the <UNK> wolf or at least that's what i make of it and then he's being chased by some military men especially this last bit is ridiculous i mean i can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment imagine soldiers with night vision eye sight but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient it's beyond me why they're out to kill him why not leave him alone and look for another <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> soldier maybe and why try to kill everyone else that's involved with poor aaron isn't that a bit <UNK> who the hell are these <UNK> anyway i hope not the us army or the government they behave like <UNK> walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons <UNK> private apartments like they're after some public enemy 1 and displaying during the ultimate show down in the woods a total lack of discipline like a bunch of frightened <UNK> <UNK> and shooting randomly around br br aaron for some <UNK> medical reason feels like a wolf after the <UNK> of the eyes why would that be he suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves what is this are we supposed to believe that the memories of the <UNK> wolf are <UNK> in it's eye balls and that the <UNK> of these eye balls also <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> for red life meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land <UNK> on his all <UNK> like a cat can a wolf even do that br br the acting or the lack thereof didn't help the credibility of all this either everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls especially this indian girl she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression <UNK> and some <UNK> <UNK> about the force of nature and it beats me why aaron all of a sudden is all over her but hey there probably had to be at least one love scene i really <UNK> with actor <UNK> <UNK> who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face but they didn't give him much to go with he has to run around bare <UNK> for more than half of the movie which could have been fun to watch but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive <UNK> <UNK> really should leave his shirt on his few killings and attacks are hardly shown we just hear some <UNK> and cries of fear and then there's another victim lying down and aaron with some more blood on his face and chest not much for a modern sci fi horror the only good acting came from <UNK> <UNK> and i really like to see how she has <UNK> into a beautiful and classy forty something lady she did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions but they made her character a kind of a <UNK> who gets totally <UNK> around by the leader of these <UNK> what a pity that the script didn't make her stand up a bit more br br in the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie hardly scary or thrilling with unbelievable goings on a lot of overlong national <UNK> like visuals of wolves running around woods and <UNK> who cares some pretentious indian <UNK> about man and nature and an uneven musical score with <UNK> songs at the most inappropriate moments i guess the word superfluous covers it all
<START> that <UNK> show on fox is really making a killing can't we do our own version i <UNK> and <UNK> of course but in our hearts we all know it's true and that the only thing nbc added to the <UNK> <UNK> was sex and boy did they add sex br br thirteen year old tucker gets a <UNK> and covers it up with his <UNK> tucker accidentally walks in on his aunt in the shower and she <UNK> him of watching her and beating off he spies on the cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window and she knows he wants to see her topless but she <UNK> him by smiling and closing the window and this is all in the pilot br br take it from a grown man a boy's <UNK> is so sex crazy and <UNK> driven it is impossible to make it funny for a mainstream audience the only times anyone has ever come close has been in movies and you can count those on one hand so it's no surprise that tucker has the warmth and appeal of a strip club bathroom did the network actually think we would like watching kids <UNK> with <UNK> isn't this the stuff people go to jail for if you doubt the show's <UNK> consider this 13 episodes were filmed but nbc canceled it after only 4 episodes aired they then made the <UNK> move of burning off the remaining episodes by airing them at midnight so no children could see them ironic since kids were originally the target audience br br apart from its general <UNK> tucker features a running voice over from the lead character to flesh out the shoddy writing even in 2000 it was horribly dated with it's <UNK> incidental music and super sarcasm i couldn't like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes didn't exactly come a mile a minute shame on nbc for this dirty rip off they're better than that br br grade c
<START> this <UNK> bad piece of trash manages to be racist sexist and <UNK> all at once while pretending to be terribly <UNK> and sophisticated atrocious performances a cliche ridden screenplay and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of two scenes were especially offensive the one in which <UNK> <UNK> his tongue after being <UNK> by another man could it really have been that gross and the scene where eastwood is <UNK> by <UNK> best friend who is pretending to be russian after he leaves the room she <UNK> f king <UNK> so much for her being a <UNK> artist who dreams of living in paris br br <UNK> <UNK> can be a likeable actor on screen and is astonishingly good looking it's a shame he didn't learn more from working with cutting edge gay director <UNK> <UNK> on an earlier film and try to salvage this film from <UNK> into a string of gay stereotypes and a <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> they're not <UNK> <UNK> cary grant and <UNK> russell from his girl friday or witty detective william powell and sassy lady myrna loy from thin man but woody allen and scarlett johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur <UNK> in scoop their screwball <UNK> is more <UNK> than post depression allen's writing filled with ironic self <UNK> and plain old new york angst shades of the old wit occur rarely such as when he as sid the great <UNK> magician responds about his background i was born into the <UNK> <UNK> but when i got older i converted to <UNK> johansson fresh from allen's match point as a bad girl here gets to be a relatively good sometimes <UNK> <UNK> student caught in a murder mystery suitable for london a serial killer the plot is a <UNK> of his recent london based thriller match point right down to the upper class sins and the american tragedy place in the sun <UNK> accident as a matter of fact allen is <UNK> manhattan murder mystery and purple rose of <UNK> to name just a couple of other examples i care not if he <UNK> i would like the new material to be at least the equal of the originals and alas it is just a reflection of his younger greatness br br allen as director and actor can't hide his love for the actress as he couldn't for diane keaton and therefore takes a <UNK> comedy into an appropriate place down the allen <UNK> not great but amusing at times brilliantly satirical about the suspected upper class murderer sid allen <UNK> i'd be very surprised if he killed one person this is vintage allen humor while there are barely any bright literary <UNK> as in most of his film he <UNK> scoop with music from <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> to let us know the <UNK> has not lost his touch of class
<START> i watched the dvd of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track in english it seems in cambodia the subtitles in english say the character is speaking <UNK> but the movie says cambodia a very violent evil man is raising boys to be killers using <UNK> and training them to fight and kill he sends <UNK> to kill some people in china and during the killings a <UNK> partner is killed the cop <UNK> is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a cop who was shot and is in a coma <UNK> chief is his <UNK> friend and is worried about <UNK> <UNK> behavior he doesn't know <UNK> was the one who caught his dad in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him into the coma <UNK> escapes and hides in a <UNK> <UNK> shack where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father won't let her leave <UNK> doesn't speak chinese and doesn't understand this but saves her from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for cat iii <UNK> becomes more and more obsessed with getting <UNK> but <UNK> is almost <UNK> even after <UNK> steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where they are married and she becomes pregnant <UNK> follows and joins the evil man who's training the boys making a deal to fight and train so he can get <UNK> there is a big showdown between <UNK> and <UNK> with the terribly abused woman the major victim and leaving <UNK> dead and <UNK> cutting out his child from the dead mother only to die and leave him as the possible next boy to be raised as a killer this film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack there are many very brutal violent scenes the woman having a long nail pulled out of her foot knives to the neck and <UNK> guns fired directly to the head and several very intense <UNK> it maybe grim intense and downbeat but it is definitely worth seeing
<START> btk killer green river killer zodiac killer the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is he loves his crap br br i've never seen a <UNK> <UNK> film but i was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful like the movies i said in the beginning don't even equal a six when added together after reading the comments i was curious to see how bad this guy really is he is the worst out there br br the credits wouldn't end as the pathetic movie started and quickly i noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in the acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots the editing is easily the worst this movie made no sense and i <UNK> couldn't take it anymore as it wouldn't end and i was only 45 minutes in the movie i couldn't take it anymore i wasted 45 minutes of my life br br do not watch this crap

<START> young mr lincoln marks the first film of the director star collaboration of john ford and henry fonda i recall years ago fonda telling that as a young actor he was understandably nervous about playing abraham lincoln and scared he wouldn't live up to the challenge br br john ford before the shooting starts put him at ease by saying he wasn't going to be playing the great <UNK> but just a jack leg <UNK> lawyer that being settled fonda headed a cast that john ford directed into a classic film br br this is not a <UNK> film of lincoln that had come before in the sound era with walter huston and a year after young mr lincoln raymond massey did the <UNK> prize winning play by robert <UNK> <UNK> lincoln in <UNK> massey still remains the definitive lincoln br br but as ford said fonda wasn't playing the great <UNK> just a small town lawyer in <UNK> the film <UNK> about 10 years of <UNK> early life we see him <UNK> in a general store getting some law books from an immigrant <UNK> family whose path he would cross again later in the story and his romance with ann <UNK> with her early death leaving lincoln a most melancholy being br br fast forward about 10 years and lincoln is now a practicing attorney beginning to get some notice he's served a couple of terms in the <UNK> but he's back in private practice not really sure if politics is for him br br this is where the bulk of the action takes place the two sons of that family he'd gotten the law books from way back when are accused of murder he offers to defend them and not an ordinary murder but one of a deputy sheriff br br the trial itself is fiction but the <UNK> used in the defense of richard <UNK> and eddie <UNK> who played the two sons is based on a real case lincoln <UNK> i'll say no more br br other than the performances the great strength of young mr lincoln is the way john ford captures the mood and atmosphere and setting of a small <UNK> <UNK> town in a fourth of july celebration it's almost like you're watching a <UNK> and it was the mood of the country itself young vibrant and growing br br fans of john ford films will recognize two musical themes here that were repeated in later films during the romantic <UNK> at the beginning with fonda and pauline moore who played ann <UNK> the music in the background is the same theme used in the man who shot liberty <UNK> for vera miles and at a dance the tune lovely susan brown that fonda and <UNK> weaver who plays mary todd is the same one fonda <UNK> with cathy downs to in my darling <UNK> at the dance for the raising of a church in <UNK> br br lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of <UNK> and <UNK> because of two reasons i believe the first is he's the living <UNK> of our own american mythology about people rising from the very bottom to the <UNK> of power through their own efforts in fact young mr lincoln very <UNK> shows the background lincoln came from and secondly the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in american history and that he made a <UNK> good and moral decision to free slaves during the civil war albeit for some necessary political reasons his assassination assured his place in history br br besides fonda and others i've mentioned special praise should also go to fred <UNK> jr and ward bond the two town <UNK> <UNK> being the murder victim and bond the chief <UNK> also donald meek as the <UNK> attorney and alice brady in what turned out to be her last film as the <UNK> mother of <UNK> and <UNK> and a very nice performance by spencer <UNK> who <UNK> in <UNK> characters as the judge br br for a film that captures the drama and romance of the time it's set in you can't do better than young mr lincoln
<START> if you like <UNK> war games it's pretty good some of it is cheap but the robot fights is worth seeing i've enjoyed the <UNK> war field for some time and this is pretty much the only movie i've ever seen that come close to that feeling of what it would be like to pilot one of those huge <UNK> if you like the <UNK> then games you like are <UNK> warrior three and four and if you have an <UNK> and <UNK> to spare steel <UNK> the movie is worth seeing at least once there really needs to be some more movies on the same theme out there less remakes and more original works br br enjoy
<START> this is truly terrible painfully irritating <UNK> performers <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> incoherent dialogues which take place in scenes which seem to have no purpose no beginning middle or end cut together without any apparent narrative or even <UNK> intention all in the service of some entirely uninteresting and almost <UNK> story what makes it worse is the film's <UNK> to style suddenly a remote head <UNK> shot <UNK> <UNK> and without any apparent reason there are sudden whip pans or <UNK> held sections all this style merely serves to <UNK> the almost unbelievably huge <UNK> of the project and the almost offensive <UNK> of the material definitely a candidate for the worst film ever made
<START> saw this on cable back in the early 90's and loved it never saw it again until it showed up on cable again recently still find it a great vietnam movie not sure why its not higher rated i found everything about this film compelling as a vet not from vietnam i can relate to the situations brought by both harris and de niro i can only imagine this film being more poignant now with our situation in iraq i wish this would be offered on cable more often for people to see the human <UNK> on our soldiers isn't left on the battlefield its brought home for the rest of there lives and this film is one of many that brings that home in a very hard way excellent film
<START> i always wrote this series off as being a complete stink fest because jim belushi was involved in it and heavily but then one day a tragic <UNK> occurred after a white sox game ended i realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow now i could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote or even to the tv to turn the channel but then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch tv in another state nuts to that i said so i decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever fate had in store for me what fate had in store was an episode of this show an episode about which i remember very little except that i had once again made a very broad general sweeping <UNK> judgment based on zero objective or <UNK> evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with and once again i was completely right this show is a total <UNK> pie belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy <UNK> <UNK> the women are physically attractive but too <UNK> is to <UNK> any real feeling from the viewer there is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local tv station with a can of <UNK> and a <UNK> and sending every copy of this <UNK> howling back to hell br br except br br except for the wonderful comic <UNK> <UNK> of larry joe campbell america's greatest comic character actor this guy plays <UNK> brother in law andy and he is gold how good is he really well aside from being funny his job is to make belushi look good that's like trying to make butt <UNK> look good but campbell pulls it off with style someone should <UNK> a <UNK> prize in comic <UNK> so he can win it every year without larry joe this show would consist of a slightly <UNK> looking <UNK> <UNK> smith <UNK> belushi over the head with a <UNK> pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage 5 stars for larry joe campbell <UNK> comedic bacon because he <UNK> the flavor of everything he's in
<START> this is paul f <UNK> first and only full length feature he hasn't done anything since however he managed to get an amazing ensemble cast to portray the characters of his story i don't know when or why the idea emerged in his head but ryan wrote a screenplay which later became his own directed movie home room br br busy <UNK> carries the movie on her shoulders as alicia a troubled girl the ones we always see in television series with dark hair and black clothes a package of <UNK> in the pocket weird look and disturbing eyes with makeup of course an event has occurred at her school a shooting some students have died and she saw everything now detective martin van <UNK> victor <UNK> is investigating the case and as expected alicia is a suspect but the shooting is just the <UNK> the movie is not about the shooting br br lying in bed in a hospital room is deanna <UNK> erika christensen she is one of the survivors of the hospital the script <UNK> a bond between them by the school principal james <UNK> jr he is helping all the students to recover from the event but alicia doesn't seem to care she's isolated so the principal <UNK> her she needs to visit deanna every day until five <UNK> clock then the movie starts br br i can't even describe how wonderfully written i think the movie is i can identify with the characters and the situations they live i like reality these things could happen to anyone and the things they say are totally understandable they're growing up and trying to deal with things they haven't experienced they're doing their best without knowing it alicia when she visits deanna for the first time and deanna when she sees alicia standing in front of her are <UNK> a journey of that will define their personalities and ideas for the next step in life after high school br br the director leads christensen and <UNK> through their roles very well look the contrast between them deanna seems naive and with plain thoughts no complexity inside of her mind when alicia enters her room and sees tons of flowers she asks who has brought them many people deanna answers although some days later we learn they're from her parents who come every week the <UNK> figures are all well represented but are not as important as their <UNK> characters deanna is lonely alicia seems mature and violent smoking <UNK> and talking roughly but after two days of visiting she finds herself coming back to the hospital every day even sleeping in <UNK> room all night when they both have a fight afterwards i believe deanna says why do you keep coming back alicia is lonely too br br the ending of the movie without ruining it comes a bit disappointing it's something i wasn't waiting for it <UNK> some of the strength the movie has the revelation comes totally unnecessary ruining the logical climax the movie could have had it was an excellent script anyway and an excellent direction a damn fine movie br br when it comes to erika christensen this was the role she needed to fly higher her role in traffic was <UNK> but this was the big step the main role maybe not many had the chance to see her in this film and that's a pity she hasn't made one false move since then she has even come out with good performances in awful movies on the other hand busy <UNK> who proved to be very promising in this movie what a transformation hasn't got many opportunities for other roles br br the same i say about paul f ryan in directing of curse and i expect he is sitting now in his computer finishing his new script i'm waiting for his next movie i'm hoping the best for all of them

<START> this is arguably john <UNK> finest performance where he successfully shakes off any traits of his inspector morse character and brings a perfect adaptation of tom from the pages of the book to the tv screen this is a well made production which maintains its family viewing vibe despite some very mature themes like the <UNK> of the second world war and the physical abuse suffered by the child br br however it is the relationship between tom and young willie that is the heart and soul of this story it is touching and beautiful to see this bond between the young boy <UNK> from london and the grumpy old man he is left with develop a real grandfather <UNK> connection br br it is a pity that this story wasn't made with a bigger budget with a more established director as it belongs on the big screen not shown once or twice every ten years on a sunday afternoon given the right <UNK> john <UNK> would be celebrated the world over and <UNK> with many awards for his brilliant performance in this movie a great actor and a great role that should have been <UNK> more than it was at the time
<START> this sword <UNK> story of an <UNK> brutal and <UNK> hero <UNK> an evil king is worthless in almost every detail the acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles the <UNK> <UNK> glee with which the director shows the hero <UNK> blood around is absolutely disgusting nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause since he is as bad as the people he's fighting z movie editing is <UNK> including a scene where a character dies from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely br br the movie is clearly <UNK> on the charms of the female leads <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> who are <UNK> around mostly naked throughout the movie as a 20 something male i will not pretend that female flesh on the screen doesn't attract me but the treatment of their characters is so <UNK> and the sex scenes so casual and <UNK> that i couldn't enjoy even this aspect of the movie br br most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light hearted tongue in cheek feel the sequel is better in this regard but deathstalker seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy no way avoid at all costs br br rating 1 2 out of
<START> the first two sequences of this movie set up the two conflicts the <UNK> conflict between the soldier todd and his <UNK> humanity and the physical conflict between todd and his bio <UNK> replacement both sequences are quite gripping in different ways br br <UNK> screenplay <UNK> somewhat by <UNK> the first of these <UNK> half way through the movie which means the second half is little more than a straightforward action romp br br nonetheless kudos to the makers for creating an genre action piece with heart and even a bit of soul and especially to kurt russell who conveys much with very little br br not a great film but one worth seeing
<START> creep is a straight up serious horror film set in real time that wants nothing more than to just show people get attacked in a empty subway platform by a mutant for 85 minutes and it does just that nothing more nothing less director christopher smith draws out the drama a far as he <UNK> can by introducing a series of characters that would actually have a reason to be in the subway after it is locked he also leaves the origins of the titular creep deliberately vague <UNK> experiments happening in the 60s underground are hinted at and that little bit of mystery works for the most part sadly he <UNK> himself toward the end by actually holding back from a twist ending where more genetic <UNK> would appear they are hinted at as well yes you heard me right i wanted a clichéd twist ending <UNK> run lola run <UNK> is good as the <UNK> female lead and the rest of the cast is fine
<START> this movie could have been very good but comes up way short cheesy special effects and so so acting i could have looked past that if the story wasn't so lousy if there was more of a background story it would have been better the plot centers around an evil <UNK> witch who is linked to this woman who gets <UNK> the movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything it just keeps plodding on christopher walken has a part but it is completely senseless as is most of the movie this movie had potential but it looks like some really bad made for tv movie i would avoid this movie
<START> trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality but these scenes are just rare <UNK> picked out to attract audience they are of course showing the main message of the movie br br people who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives using power which they may have somewhere else to <UNK> <UNK> others and at the low end of the <UNK> chain mostly women br br a movie showing this as brutally as <UNK> is surely tough to face but having to endure such lives is even <UNK> br br technically the film is much like short cuts but <UNK> of documentary style episodes featuring people like your <UNK> playing just the way they are without any <UNK> and most <UNK> without any hope its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing because you realize such people are out there and there are many of them although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks somewhere the porn industry has to do its business somewhere <UNK> domestic violence has to take place somewhere hopes have to <UNK> i sure do know such people br br if you want to see a movie without any funny scenes some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten <UNK> is funny but this happens for real and without any melodramatic go watch this movie however it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles i fear as subtitles <UNK> transport <UNK>
<START> what is the most harrowing movie ever made the <UNK> nightmare of <UNK> and <UNK> the acid <UNK> of fassbinder the <UNK> black comedy of <UNK> house on the left i'm sure for that portion of the film loving public that tie their <UNK> to the good ship buster keaton there is only one answer any one of his sound films br br i don't know what <UNK> my soul more <UNK> in this movie the <UNK> of keaton's intricate and <UNK> physical art to <UNK> slapstick the painful <UNK> of this master filmmaker with dialogue not that he hasn't a lovely comic voice or that he can't make dialogue funny it's just that the studio don't seem to have given him enough takes and so he seems to be trying to remember his lines before he delivers which only makes him keaton not his character look silly or is it the <UNK> of seeing keaton caught up in a <UNK> sex farce when he has given us some of the <UNK> accounts of romantic frustration in film br br no i know what was most disturbing having to watch buster keaton <UNK> greatest comedian sit aside to observe jimmy <UNK> doing his <UNK> it is horrors such as this that get <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br mgm seem to have got the curious idea that the best way to adapt keaton to sound was to turn him into a marx brother complete with verbal <UNK> elaborate tedious <UNK> <UNK> slapstick theatrical setting triumph through chaos and thelma todd keaton was just not that sort of comic and where <UNK> <UNK> tongue and <UNK> <UNK> might just have made this plot work <UNK> socially inept professor can't he is too studied and predictable br br what buster needed was to be allowed experiment like lang in <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> he would never have tried to hold back the tide like chaplin when a film like 'the <UNK> is <UNK> to messing about with trains the loss becomes even more apparent br br and the thing is in <UNK> amid the flat direction the film isn't all that bad there is an excellent <UNK> when a camera on the bus leaves keaton alone at a <UNK> station and the denouement if hardly original is at least <UNK> than what went before there is something almost endearing about the way keaton slows down a plot that needs all the <UNK> it can get br br there is a film in here about loneliness emotionally <UNK> order the numbing effects of education etc struggling to get out the best way to appreciate this film is to watch not the narrative of professor <UNK> post but of <UNK> genius buster keaton trapped in a prison of mediocrity <UNK> by new technology <UNK> by a <UNK> fate in this case the studio <UNK> a <UNK> grace looked at like that it becomes a kind of masterpiece
<START> if dick tracy was in black and white the <UNK> wouldn't be religious giving a new sense to the concept of color in a movie we are offered an unique experience throughout a comic strip world and it's one of the few movies which succeeded in doing so thanks to a serious script good direction great performances al pacino is astonishing and most importantly a powerful mix of cinematography art direction and costume design using only primary colors the experience is quite different from anything we have seen before and there is also a quite successful <UNK> to all the gangster movie genre <UNK> <UNK> from modern cinema overall i see this movie as a fresh attempt and a touch of originality to a cinema which relies more and more on the old and already seen <UNK> 7 out of 10
<START> bacall does well here especially considering this is only her 2nd film this one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great <UNK> to have and to have not 1944 and the big sleep 1945 both of which paired her with <UNK> bogart granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but i think through no fault of her own i think there was some <UNK> in having her portray a british upper <UNK> lady no accent whatsoever i think all the strange accents were distracting boyer was certainly no <UNK> it was hard to keep straight which country people were from br br i really liked the black and white cinematography mood is used to great affect i especially liked the fog scene the lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tension br br bacall is just gorgeous boyer just doesn't fit the romantic leading man role for me so he and bacall together was a little strange not great chemistry and certainly no <UNK> and bacall magic but i still really liked this picture there is great tension and it moves along well enough i must say i found the murder of the little girl quite bold for this period film br br <UNK> <UNK> and peter lorre stand out as supporting cast <UNK> as the hotel keeper is absolutely villainous and evil in her portrayal her one scene where she laughs <UNK> as mr <UNK> is leaving after exposing her as the child's murderer is quite disturbing lorre also does quite well in his slimy snake portrayal of <UNK> a sleazy coward to the end <UNK> <UNK> also does quite well in portraying the child else especially considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time though she appears much younger turns out she later married <UNK> murphy which proved to be a short lived <UNK> marriage
<START> despite the occasionally stilted acting and seen it all before story this is a fairly compelling movie br br it has suspense the scenes with the demon are actually pretty creepy some of the visual effects are superb and best of all no ridiculously ill placed humour to detract from the film as too many wannabe horror films have in them now br br honestly this isn't the greatest film ever made but it actually draws you in and at least makes an attempt at character development br br i was glad i watched it
<START> i picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my <UNK> for femme <UNK> well for the previous it is better than daytime television though i'm not sure how much br br it does have its points but after about the first 20 30 minutes the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a made for tv movie that was put together with not much time to make something that will hold together in short a terrible sci fi channel type movie br br it has its points such as the future is dirty like blade runner showed of course this is no blade runner the captain looks sort of feels like actor robert <UNK> the kind of person one might want to be around br br but unfortunately it rather ends up feeling like a bad <UNK> rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart <UNK> of aliens the <UNK> is vampire <UNK> sexually <UNK> and the new captain might as well be like jan michael vincent running around on danger island in the banana <UNK> he only put on the uniform with the <UNK> he's got very little right to it all of them running around with their version of force <UNK> inside a ship that looks very much like the <UNK> <UNK> as they are fighting a class of <UNK> who <UNK> the universe and are broken up into several different <UNK> or <UNK> of different <UNK> qualities just like the <UNK> in <UNK> br br it might have a redeeming feature with michael <UNK> but after a while one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot he probably had fun doing it but it doesn't help the movie much br br it's okay okay in the way that one might watch the dvd once without turning it off if they watch it with commercials they will probably change the channel one might watch it once but a few hours later be wondering what it was that made them watch it all br br for me that was the femme fatale when she was fighting
<START> although the movie is clearly dated audiences can still easily identify with the plight of hapless buster in this timeless and very funny underdog tale buster fights against <UNK> odds in three different ages the stone age the roman age and the <UNK> age playing almost the same character with just a change of scenery to help us identify the different ages in this movie we see one of the earliest comedic depictions of the <UNK> stereotype who wins his love not by romance but by <UNK> force as well as a funny twist on roman <UNK> combat two comedic sketches that long <UNK> such spoofs as mel <UNK> history of the world part i the underlying theme of the movie is simple yet convincing although the times may have a changed we still face the same struggles even in modern times that we fought in <UNK> times in order to win the girl keep in mind this is the theme of <UNK> america a time when <UNK> was still en <UNK> it is interesting to look at this movie over <UNK> years later and consider how dramatically things have changed from this movie's modern times to now
<START> <UNK> and i first of all struck me as a masterpiece documentary the photography and the editing are truly breath taking almost anti dogma br br we follow the life of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> through an open hearted interview from 1971 the <UNK> series was drawn on the background of the great <UNK> fights of the <UNK> century in the midst of these <UNK> has his own demons to fight with and much of his drawing activity seems like an attempt to tame these and to escape into a world of perfection br br even though there are spectacular <UNK> <UNK> of drawings from <UNK> albums and also some <UNK> and reading of <UNK> from the albums the story of <UNK> is told entirely through interviews and archive material and never through <UNK> br br <UNK> lived the <UNK> life of a true suffering artist but the fantastic world that came of his imagination will continue to <UNK> readers again and again
<START> well i would consider police story as one of jackie chan's best film the plot the fighting scenes and the stunt works are excellent in this film jackie himself acted as a police officer called chan <UNK> <UNK> kevin chan in some versions who successfully arrested a crime lord after the crime lord was released due to lack of evidence he framed chan for the killing of a police officer due to this he became wanted by the police later on <UNK> <UNK> lin who was the secretary of the crime lord went to a shopping mall and started to steal the evidence of the crime <UNK> crimes from his computer and preparing to pass them to chan however the crime lord knew that <UNK> had <UNK> his <UNK> data and hired his henchmen to capture her later on chan appeared at the scenes and began to fight all of the henchmen <UNK> them one by one at the last scene chan was seen <UNK> the crime lord lastly this is the best action and comedy movie everyone should watch it highly recommended
<START> the sun should set on this movie forever br br it goes on forever which isn't usually a bad thing the english patient <UNK> list but is so tedious the aging of the actors is unbelievable and so is the drawn out never ending story line which really seems to go nowhere br br in short a waste of talent and film
<START> let me make one thing <UNK> for the most part the mentality of those who run the show in hollywood frankly p <UNK> me right off in general and even more specifically in relation to its treatment of much loved iconic characters from the pages of comic books why well let's take a typical hollywood executive board meeting scenario to illustrate shall <UNK> br br executive no 1 <UNK> there's lots of dollars to be <UNK> from superhero flicks these days ' br br executive no 2 <UNK> point let's make one with <UNK> then  we'll do a lucky <UNK> in a hat and pick out a superhero at random to base a film upon ' the <UNK> takes place and a famous <UNK> name is pulled out br br executive no 1 <UNK> now who can we get to play the part ' br br executive no 2 <UNK> a big box office star at the moment ' br br executive no 1 ' name of big actor is the in thing this week ' br br executive no 2 <UNK> does he really suit the role i mean he doesn't resemble the character whatsoever ' br br executive no 1 <UNK> cares he's a big name we'll make the film with him in it anyway ' br br executive no 2 <UNK> quite right and besides we'll fill the entire film so chock full of <UNK> special effects to <UNK> the moronic masses that no one will ever question it anyway ' br br the above scenario clearly illustrates one of the reasons i generally <UNK> most modern superhero movies all style no substance and simply pathetic casting of the iconic leads of course to be <UNK> there are exceptions to the above rule when hollywood does get it right  take the casting of the original and still easily the best superman christopher reeve and more recently patrick stewart and sir ian <UNK> in the x men films br br but back to the general negative traits displayed by hollywood <UNK> wouldn't it be wonderful if our studio executives were to always choose actors who actually suited the roles well in this less than ideal world one filmmaker does just this believe it or not by casting actors based upon their genuine resemblance to their comic book counterparts his name is sandy <UNK> sadly but typically hollywood has not as of yet allowed <UNK> to direct a full length film but luckily for us he has given us <UNK> glimpses of what the finished outcome would likely look like in the form of two as of yet famous super hero short features one is the superb batman dead end and the other is this mock trailer for an entirely <UNK> film called worlds finest br br well let's not <UNK> our words here  this is absolutely awesome stuff br br the casting of mr universe winner and male model michael <UNK> who looked similarly awesome but was utterly wasted in the lackluster barbarian makes for the most perfect choice to play the iconic man of steel in fact in terms of physical resemblance there has undoubtedly never been a closer <UNK> to the comic character br br added to this clark <UNK> is back fresh from his splendid portrayal as the dark knight in batman dead end again yet another hugely <UNK> piece of casting br br what can i say  if only this was indeed a real full length film hollywood studio executives  take note this is how it should be done br br as a final note i am once again intrigued by the vastly split reactions this short film has <UNK> from fans <UNK> the most <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> reactions against it clearly come once more as similarly with batman dead end from a younger less <UNK> experienced audience a fact betrayed by their somewhat <UNK> primitive <UNK> and liberal usage of base <UNK> such an unfortunate state of closed <UNK> is indeed a sad phenomenon albeit one that our aforementioned studio executives in hollywood will no doubt <UNK> great satisfaction from after all these very same misguided individuals are in all <UNK> the exact same sort of cgi addicted popcorn <UNK> <UNK> that <UNK> in the majority of crap that hollywood <UNK> out by the <UNK> these days
<START> so i <UNK> on the digital <UNK> channels one night a couple of years ago and thought i'd pass a half hour watching <UNK> while waiting for <UNK> war to start with a title like that i figured it was some exploitation <UNK> <UNK> about inner city girl gangs br br much to my surprise it wasn't about that at all instead it is a well acted well scripted story about a young woman who almost accidentally gets into female boxing she is responsible for taking her younger brother to his practice sessions and get interested while <UNK> his <UNK> as he doesn't really want to be a boxer only following through on their father's wishes she convinces his coach to take her on in his <UNK> br br the story unfolds in an intelligent and believable way as she goes through various trials on her quest for starters her brother's coach doesn't want to take on a female boxer after <UNK> doing so there is the problem of <UNK> up matches for her then the confrontation with her father when he finds out what is going on yes a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot coming across more of an interesting inter human reaction with its own fight related consequences br br all in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of some time later when i saw the much advertised and acclaimed million dollar baby i thought wait a minute this seems kind of familiar needless to say i didn't watch <UNK> war that night
<START> never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent let's see first they get every willing <UNK> to hype this film as the greatest thing since <UNK> white bread next they encourage as many <UNK> christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to <UNK> its <UNK> production costs and <UNK> up its advertising budget and finally when the film hits the theaters get as many said christians as possible to see it yet again bus them into the <UNK> if necessary not on the merits of the film itself but because a 1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory br br but that of course won't be enough i imagine that any film critic with the <UNK> to give left behind anything short of a glowing review will be deemed anti christian br br of course this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldn't surprise anyone it is after all good old fashioned capitalism at work what does surprise me is how many people have been <UNK> into the whole left behind mindset as someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and <UNK> it leaves me scratching my head it would appear that there are many many people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a rapture is going to occur and that millions of people all over the earth are going to simultaneously <UNK> into thin air what kind of reality i wonder are these people living in is this rapture something they actually believe in or is it something they <UNK> want to believe in and when they reach the end of their lives and realize this rapture has not occurred will they be disappointed and <UNK> will there still be people 100 years from now <UNK> that the rapture is <UNK> br br in a way i almost wish that such an event would occur what an interesting day that would be what would be even more interesting is if the apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion not in the <UNK> sense the authors of the left behind series have portrayed but as more of a stephen spielberg production with <UNK> clouds <UNK> angels <UNK> out of the sky moon turned to blood the whole nine <UNK> imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true just as the <UNK> had been warning for years and that there was something more awesome than just the cold hard physical reality we inhabit wouldn't that be something br br yet in the final analysis it's that cold hard physical reality that i will content myself with my life is not so meaningless that i need the fear of a rapture and the end times to make sense of it all nor do i need heaven or hell to <UNK> or scare me into behaving <UNK> thank you very much
<START> yesterday i went alone to the cinema because here in mexico most of the times movies from other countries are part of the so called <UNK> <UNK> alternative camera but after i saw this movie i realized that not all the foreign movies are alternative <UNK> this is a good a example but i have to said that i enjoyed so much this movie that at the end i was happy this movie is a little <UNK> of hope in these days and the main lesson for me is that at the end of the day the love is main force behind us this is a good option to see a good movie in spanish and i have to mention the good music specially the main song of the movie <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> <UNK> la <UNK> excellent song
<START> the worst movie in the history of cinema i don't know if it was trying to be funny or sad poignant or <UNK> but the end result was unwatchable everyone from key grip to robin williams and back down to best boy should be ashamed to be a part of this film
<START> this one is just like the <UNK> movie the movie is really bad it offers nothing in the death department the one liners are bad and are something that shouldn't be in a <UNK> movie freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie lisa <UNK> is still the only thing that makes this one worth while the characters are extremely underdeveloped all in all better than the <UNK> one but still one the worst movies of the series my rating 2 10
<START> it has its <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is both the merits and the <UNK> she's so enigmatic so original is it her method of dealing with the pain of a lost one that's making her so distant and un <UNK> or is she as one reviewer called her a revolutionary personally i'd call her dysfunctional br br <UNK> is completely <UNK> herself <UNK> of her boyfriend not thinking of <UNK> family or using the money he gave her for a proper funeral she <UNK> <UNK> out on a trip to spain she's seems so devoid of anything relatively human bar greed the only element that <UNK> the audience see the human side of her is her close friend she takes on holiday with her although by the end her friend is dumped and <UNK> has nothing that ties her down to humanity she may as well have killed herself br br despite managing to make spain look as gloomy and bland as the uk the director's shots were superb the lighting and color made the film visually stunning br br it's really a shame the movie has nothing in it that keeps interest it's little over 90 minutes but feels a lot longer they manage to make <UNK> seem interesting to grab your attention but do nothing with her only alienate her from you more to the point where you don't care about the characters or the film
<START> doc savage the man of <UNK> 1 outta 5 stars br br dreadful dreadful movie based on the pulp magazine <UNK> series by lester <UNK> kenneth <UNK> about a super heroic adventure hero in the <UNK> and his five <UNK> all experts in some field of <UNK> that allows them to combat evil it was a pretty hokey series but kinda fun to read when i was a teenager i knew they made a movie version in the '70s starring ron tarzan <UNK> but i never got a chance to see it it never played in theaters where i lived and was never shown on tv now that i have finally seen the film i can understand why the plot and characters are never treated seriously it's all kind of tongue in cheek and campy kind of like the old batman tv series only without the benefit of being funny or having any visual flair corny dialogue cheesy special effects dumb stereotypes crummy action scenes and bad bad acting actually i find it kind of fascinating in its badness what could they have possibly been thinking arnold <UNK> was <UNK> to be starring in a modern day remake but i don't imagine that would have turned out to be much better
<START> eight simple rules started as a very entertaining series i love john ritter and his character paul <UNK> and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show br br i have always preferred <UNK> to bridget bridget has been done before <UNK> is quite unique and i can relate to her in many ways although i'm not sure i like the direction her character went in later series br br early episodes were fun good simple teenage plots about paul and <UNK> <UNK> the kids however i think the show lost it's <UNK> when john ritter died i admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died i felt the programme did to to me the whole point of the show was based around the guide of the <UNK> simple rules of dating my teenage <UNK> it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and the angle of the show had changed without the <UNK> dad br br bridget seemed to get more annoying <UNK> stayed the same and <UNK> was always giving her <UNK> life's lessons which before seemed funnier when it was all left to paul i think the <UNK> is funny especially when he's watching great escape but feel c j is unnecessary to the show he is funny in parts but i felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other american comedy series over all the newer ones aren't bad just missing excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that <UNK> works at the school and c j and <UNK> always there too i would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for paul and <UNK> but later ones were about average at best
<START> frankly i don't understand why this movie has been such a big flop in publicity sharon stone certainly has not lost any of her charisma and touch since basic instinct i voted this film 10 and i tell you why game opens in london this time london is the city where catherine <UNK> has moved since the events in <UNK> again she proves to be a mastermind <UNK> of her own class <UNK> she is <UNK> your brain as catherine with such a skill that in the end you don't be quite sure who is the real villain br br as for the technical part of the film only real <UNK> is the b rate crew of actors sharon stone is the only really big name in the cast compared to her and michael douglas etc in the first part i also think <UNK> would have been better had sharon stone been a bit younger but she is still quite stunning in her looks and has only improved concerning her charisma her b rate <UNK> are not so bad either although i would have wanted some bigger names to the cast br br i think there are quite good <UNK> in the basic plot i think this is a far better thriller than many of the run off the mill crap hollywood so readily <UNK> these days the plot is great it's easy to see technically you don't <UNK> in the half way through the film and most important the heath is on
<START> ok i'll be honest when i first saw the trailer for the programme i thought it was an <UNK> for some sun screen product with all the people walking around on the beach despite this i decided to watch it thinking it would be some new show i could laugh at but i was seriously amazed br br from the first 10 seconds of the program i was hooked why is he lying in the trees why did the plane crash etc etc br br it's not everyday that a show comes along which combines intelligence humour action and suspense but <UNK> manages all of this with a great cast and crew beautiful locations and pretty decent special effects <UNK> will catch anyone who tunes in and is a must see for anyone who's sick of cheesy sitcoms and crappy reality tv br br lost is on <UNK> at 10 on channel 4 uk 4 8 15 16 23 <UNK> o
<START> the first one meant victory this one means defeat it takes place in a bolivia there the <UNK> are sick and <UNK> and don't meet that much sympathy from the <UNK> if you know your 60s history you understand how it ends you will understand it even without that knowledge br br del toro is once again splendid he goes on building this icon about the revolutionary who remains the same regardless of success or failure that's what guevara is according to the legend but still it's so well acted br br the documentary feeling is there around the icon which is one of the greatest achievements in this big soderbergh project he has succeeded
<START> this is some of the worst acting i have ever seen i love <UNK> <UNK> but this is just absolute dreck aside from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music this film is just <UNK> bad acting and dumb material jared harris is particularly bad but no one in this is remotely good the plot is a joke but not the haha kind i don't even know if you can forgive movies that are this bad please <UNK> the last hour and a half of my life how did this director make <UNK> and another girl another planet
<START> i really liked this movie i saw the original classic a few times but could hardly remember any details i think this movie is much better than the cartoon its not so black and white as it i specially liked how they made the grinch such a complete character and gave a cause of why he was the way he was the villain in this movie was not the actual grinch but the major much different than the original cartoon jim carrey was perfect for the part all in all a great movie made for both kids and adults alike
<START> the cover on the dvd and disc is freaking awesome you would think they made a movie about sweet tooth from twisted metal black which is still a really great idea but this movie's actors are worst then ben's performance in pearl harbor <UNK> have better quality and better actors i was gonna buy the dvd but luckily i rented it first the plot and script are also horrible nothing seems to go to together so the movie really never makes sense the poor attempts to <UNK> you using flashback scenes are worse then ones used in 80's sitcom shows and in the end it'll leave you wanting to bang your head against the wall of your house
<START> what a huge pile of dung shot on video really crappy camcorder not digital pile of garbage it is without a doubt the stupidest thing ever made the fact that this crap was actually released is completely <UNK> everyone who sees it will become <UNK> for having watched it seriously i felt like it killed several brain cells after i watched this garbage the positive reviews of this a crap were obviously made by the filmmaker and i use the term very loosely himself and or his family and friends because no normal person with the intelligence of a <UNK> would honestly like this waste of life trust me stay the hell away from this video you'll thank me for it avoid it like <UNK>
<START> first this is a review of the two disc set that came together with the wonderland dvd rental br br the two movies included with the rental wonderland and the johnny <UNK> documentary totally <UNK> the myth created by boogie nights that myth being that the characters involved in the adult movie trade were considerably more than slimy <UNK> that would do anything for money basically denying that they were anything other than <UNK> self centered <UNK> this is amazingly similar to what the book <UNK> and the movie <UNK> did to the godfather fable and most of the rest of the gangster <UNK> <UNK> br br now what irritated me most while watching these movies and will probably <UNK> anyone who saw and liked boogie nights is how foolish and <UNK> supposedly educated and sophisticated people can be <UNK> <UNK> in boogie nights is without a doubt john holmes who unlike <UNK> <UNK> had no redeeming quality holmes was a criminal <UNK> who abused anyone close to him was totally consumed by his quest for self <UNK> and was without a doubt a key <UNK> in the brutal murders on wonderland <UNK> in los angeles in 1981 the movie lays bare the big lie that boogie nights was and <UNK> the linda <UNK> description of the cruel and pathetic business that is known as the adult film entertainment industry this should be required viewing both features on the wonderland dvd for anyone who had any positive opinions on the story in the movie boogie nights
<START> i recently got the chance to view the <UNK> and quite liked it i don't really understand why its called that as there isn't really any dancing going on there except maybe for the dancing at the strip club near the end we are introduced to the main characters throughout the movie <UNK> in a hospital the story shows a love affair between a physically <UNK> guy and a healthy woman which is a very sweet story unfortunately you don't get to see movies like that today im not stuck in a time <UNK> im not saying that everything during the 80s and early 90s was better than today but i really think the movie industry is <UNK> and there's much we can learn from old movies by old movies i mean anything from <UNK> 1998
<START> grand epic as it is kenneth branagh's monumental rendering of what is perhaps william shakespeare's most popular tragedy suffers under the weight of its four hour playing time and certainly takes some real staying power two entirely separate <UNK> would most likely be better in order to fully appreciate what is certainly high class film making while i absolutely acknowledge this masterpiece as such i must confess to a lack of enthusiasm for the old <UNK> <UNK> his <UNK> and he sends himself up so well and his many <UNK> thus hamlet loses its impact as it loses its grip br br from patrick <UNK> music to alex <UNK> cinematography to tim <UNK> exquisite sets the movie is a feast of visual and <UNK> <UNK> which <UNK> a fine cast branagh has taken on three huge <UNK> adapting directing and playing his adaptation is superb his direction strong but by the time he got to the role of hamlet the strain seemed to be showing yet still he does a fine job in what is an incredibly <UNK> role derek <UNK> <UNK> up the sinister <UNK> with glee and julie christie is most dramatic as his queen <UNK> richard <UNK> is marvellous as <UNK> and charlton heston is once again a strong screen influence as the player king many others drop by including jack lemmon superb in a very small role billy crystal dame <UNK> <UNK> sir john mills sir john gielgud sir richard attenborough and gerard depardieu the acting prize though must go to one of the great <UNK> <UNK> of recent years kate <UNK> hers is a moving portrayal of the most tragic figure in this whole affair <UNK> br br to finish before this review goes on longer than the film i must say it is the length that really <UNK> the viewer in this movie branagh has directed with purpose giving many important <UNK> scenes too many of them <UNK> their welcome watching this film holds a fantastic reminder of the many <UNK> of wisdom we have garnered from it neither a <UNK> nor a <UNK> be or be true to <UNK> and of course to be or not to be br br the opening two hours does take some <UNK> but if you do manage to stay tuned you are sure to be treated to a rousing finale which <UNK> momentum from the tragic funeral <UNK> br br monday june 8 1998 <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie is very hilarious and it has a great <UNK> of actors like william h macy which always have perform this kind of roles maybe his most representative <UNK> and george clooney which is a very good actor showing his comedian work in brothers cohen film oh brother where art <UNK> which results to be one of my favorite movies ever but it's been hard to find welcome to <UNK> here in mexico my city lacks of good places where to buy some good films i tried to buy it at blockbuster but they don't know it by the original name so maybe it will be a little easier to find if i have the name they gave to it in mexico do someone knows it because i can't remember cheers a
<START> when i was little my parents took me along to the theater to see interiors it was one of many movies i watched with my parents but this was the only one we walked out of since then i had never seen interiors until just recently and i could have lived out the rest of my life without it what a pretentious <UNK> and painfully boring piece of 70's wine and cheese tripe woody allen is one of my favorite directors but interiors is by far the worst piece of crap of his career in the <UNK> style of <UNK> <UNK> allen gives us a dark <UNK> muted insight in to the lives of a family <UNK> by the psychological damage caused by divorce <UNK> career love non love <UNK> whatever the film intentionally has no comic relief no music and is <UNK> in shadowy pathos this film style can be best defined as <UNK> in nature using an <UNK> method of dialogue to <UNK> a more <UNK> depth of meaning and truth but woody allen is no <UNK> bergman the film is painfully slow and dull but beyond that i simply had no connection with or sympathy for any of the characters instead i felt only contempt for this parade of <UNK> whining <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> quest for identity amid a backdrop of <UNK> <UNK> and baked <UNK> <UNK> the story <UNK> like a fart in the room everyone speaks in affected <UNK> and <UNK> language between <UNK> everyone is lost and struggling desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever and it just goes on and on to the point where you just want to slap all of them it's never about resolution it's only about interminable <UNK> <UNK> it is nothing more than a psychological drama taken to an extreme beyond the audience's ability to connect woody allen chose to make characters so immersed in themselves we feel left out and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and <UNK> <UNK> i see what he was going for but his <UNK> on promoting his message through <UNK> <UNK> and distorted film techniques <UNK> it past the point of relevance i highly recommend this one if you're feeling a little too happy and need something to remind you of death otherwise let's just pretend this film never happened
<START> i watched the pie <UNK> last night and the word that comes to mind is original it is a word not used much in tv as they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows unfunny comedies and reality crap br br the first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of jim <UNK> those not familiar with the british carry on series or those who have not listened to a harry potter book may not be familiar with <UNK> i am not sure whether his presence as narrator adds or <UNK> i will have to tune in more but it does give the show a harry potter atmosphere maybe that's a good thing br br lee pace infamous the white <UNK> has a gift it never explains where he got it but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute he teams with <UNK> <UNK> boston public roll <UNK> to solve murders using this talent everything is fine and funny until he comes across a childhood love anna <UNK> goal the dream begins <UNK> and things really get complicated he can't send her back and he can never touch her boy would that make a relationship difficult br br i will be <UNK> in to see where this series goes in the expectation that it will continue to entertain
<START> we're a long way from laura once again otto preminger directs dana andrews stars as a police detective named mark and gene tierney is the beautiful woman who <UNK> him but nothing else about where the sidewalk ends resembles everyone's favorite sophisticated murder mystery instead of deliciously <UNK> dialogue we get gritty harrowing realism while the earlier film took place in the <UNK> upper <UNK> of new york society here we're in the low rent district of dark streets <UNK> cheap <UNK> and crummy <UNK> tierney gorgeous as ever now works as a department store <UNK> and lives in washington heights the neighborhood of the doll who once got a fox fur out of <UNK> mark <UNK> this time andrews is mark dixon an older <UNK> more troubled version of the cool cop in a <UNK> coat br br where the sidewalk ends belongs to a sub genre of noir movies about police brutality focusing on cops who can't control their violent <UNK> like kirk <UNK> character in detective story dixon owes his <UNK> contempt for crooks to his father's criminal past where douglas is self righteous and blind to his own faults andrews is <UNK> by repressed guilt and self loathing he accidentally kills a suspect and covers up his actions with an attempt to throw suspicion on a slimy gangster gary <UNK> whom he has been <UNK> pursuing for years instead a kindly cab driver is suspected because he's the father of the dead man's estranged and <UNK> wife morgan gene tierney dixon falling in love with the wife of the man he killed tries desperately to save her father without giving himself away br br among noir protagonists dana andrews had this distinction he was incapable of appearing <UNK> even when playing an average joe as he usually did he always comes across as unusually sensitive and <UNK> more than that his air of being too thoughtful for his own comfort gives him that haunted and haunting quality that was his essence as an actor he played ordinary guys cops and soldiers but always with a tragic <UNK> of seeing and knowing too much his <UNK> heroes are marked by <UNK> guilt the inability ever to <UNK> up no other actor could have expressed so well the <UNK> up anger the slow burning pain the <UNK> intelligence of mark dixon he also has a muted <UNK> a <UNK> warmth and even <UNK> humor that make him heartbreaking this comes out when he takes morgan to a restaurant where he's a regular and for the first time we see this cold brutal man <UNK> mock insults with the waitress whose sarcasm can't hide her affection and concern for him when dixon asks his partner for money to get a lawyer for <UNK> father he supplies it even though they recently <UNK> and dixon threw a punch at him there are no words about loyalty or knowing he's a good guy deep down but we see it all in the man's <UNK> silence and his wife's <UNK> as she hands over some jewelry to <UNK> <UNK> goodness comes across through other people's reactions to him as much as through <UNK> deeply moving performance br br though dana andrews was a minor star he may be the quintessential forties man he goes through some movies hardly ever taking off his <UNK> with that <UNK> mid century <UNK> further <UNK> by the <UNK> the glass of <UNK> the cigarette he doesn't take out of his mouth when he talks he looks imprisoned in the <UNK> ideal of <UNK> and <UNK> while many <UNK> <UNK> the two <UNK> tough guy where the sidewalk ends offers an <UNK> portrait of the reality behind the <UNK> a gripping and melancholy exploration of the roots and consequences of violence br br andrews was sadly underrated in his own time he was the only one of the three protagonists in the best years of our lives not nominated for an academy award though his low key performance is far more compelling than <UNK> <UNK> hammy oscar winning drunk fortunately andrews appeared in some films that <UNK> his <UNK> and now at last this little known film which contains his best performance can be seen as part of the marvelous fox film noir set this series including a number of never before released titles such as nightmare alley and <UNK> highway suggests that <UNK> century fox may have had the finest record of all the major studios when it came to film noir
<START> i have absolutely no knowledge of author <UNK> <UNK> or any of her novels and if tom s midnight garden is typical of her work i probably would have had little interest in her books as a child when i was a child i <UNK> t really interested in <UNK> unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count br br judging by this film version of tom s midnight garden i guess <UNK> writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist tom long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a <UNK> one having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people <UNK> t have in the 1950s so i guess there s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere there s also a romance involving a young girl called <UNK> but again are cynical kids <UNK> by love stories perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative br br this is a <UNK> film that seems dated by its source it s <UNK> but i m surprised by its high rating by the imdb voters i wonder how many of them would have given it so many high marks if they were 10 year olds who d just seen the lord of the rings trilogy
<START> this is actually a <UNK> neat little flick made on absolutely no discernible budget with shot on video <UNK> it takes a little while to warm up to it the acting is so bad that it soon <UNK> a <UNK> like charm after a few scenes you stop <UNK> the awkward lines or <UNK> sound of some <UNK> the characters all develop a quirky charm especially richard forget anthony hopkins <UNK> is the guy i'd hire to play a raving psychopath he just seems to enjoy it so very much mixed in with the scenes of mad slasher gore and zombie <UNK> are some truly visually effective shots of the title character the midnight <UNK> <UNK> through the campus in a black <UNK> looking for all the world like a cross between the grim <UNK> and say the silver <UNK> these shots make the sometimes ludicrous things the characters say about the <UNK> seem almost ominous the soundtrack features some very fun garage punk tunes and the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of it <UNK> well with the film's mood thumbs <UNK> i say
<START> i might not have been the biggest blair witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort so i was looking forward to altered especially after reading the <UNK> thrown around in various imdb comments unique intelligent a future cult classic and so on you gotta wonder where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor effort br br because alas altered is a poor weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect the silliness is not funny the horror and gore is not scary and whatever thinking aspect some poor <UNK> saw in this movie were due to severe <UNK> because there's certainly nothing profound or smart about this mess br br ok so we know nothing stands out is it at least bearable is the experience worthwhile in any way unfortunately no for starters get very poor acting it's not a stretch to say most b movies these days feature better acting the plot boring and messy dialogs many amateurs actually do better br br it's really the direction that <UNK> i did not expect major <UNK> over blair witch but at least small steps forward instead our director seems to have <UNK> over time completely oblivious to previous experiences br br if there is a major flaw in altered it's the main set a major part of the plot takes place in a single location where the main characters are confined but <UNK> has failed to give the place any personality whatsoever considering that in blair witch the forest plays a major part and is as much a character an antagonist if you will as the three students you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here but no this place has no personality whatsoever thanks to sloppy direction and no attention to details br br there's nothing <UNK> here die hard fans of blair witch are better off following daniel <UNK> although his <UNK> is far from being golden it shows better structure than <UNK> and some lessons from blair witch are applied unfortunately in weak stories but still
<START> i will never be a member of any club that would have me br br especially this one br br <UNK> <UNK> is a single mom stripper who gets attacked by a br br female vampire and left for dead she begins to get a <UNK> for br br blood and meets up with john savage looking like he's br br wondering where he left michael <UNK> phone number savage br br is also a vampire and wants to let <UNK> join his little vampire br br family which consists of a british <UNK> the blonde <UNK> who br br attacked <UNK> and a green haired midget i am not making this br br up br br the family does not want <UNK> so they try to kill savage and <UNK> br br and <UNK> kid br br someone forgot to tell john savage that this was a drama he br br spends most of his screen time <UNK> more facial <UNK> than br br hugh grant on a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and he reads all of his lines like br br he is making a <UNK> brothers film <UNK> tries to make the br br most of a badly written role but screenwriter director <UNK> goes br br for all the vampire cliches like <UNK> eating her son's pet <UNK> br br and buying a lot of raw meat to fight the <UNK> for blood the kid br br also gets knocked around a lot for those who think watching br br violence against children is really entertaining br br the film is extra gory but not in a wild over the top way like killer br br tongue here the gore is gross and never justified it just occurs br br it is just in the budget most of the r rating goes to <UNK> br br <UNK> who are put through <UNK> strip routines in the br br background of conversation scenes the budget does not include br br vampire <UNK> all the vampires here must stab their prey to eat br br nifty idea unless you have already seen george romero's br br martin br br even at <UNK> minutes and once you throw in <UNK> attempts at br br arty direction <UNK> frames <UNK> scenes this is one br br tiresome dull and dirty ride leave this club and take a shower br br you will need it br br this is rated r for strong physical violence gun violence sexual br br violence strong gore strong profanity female nudity sexual br br references drug abuse and adult situations br br
<START> i just finished watching el <UNK> i have always taken my hat off to <UNK> <UNK> performances as he is a great actor but this movie is really depressing and slow i guess that it would have been even worse if it wasn't for <UNK> anyways this is definitely a film that you will never understand if you are not from <UNK> and even if you are i would advise you not to rent this movie in order to have a nice time with your girlfriend boyfriend family or friends it is really depressing and incredibly slow and the plot does not make a lot of sense neither probably the director wanted to show the <UNK> of the human life but what he does is bore and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little bit it gives you something to think about but not in a good way overall i definitely didn't like this movie
<START> <UNK> the dull t v shows and pilots that were <UNK> together in the 70's to make equally dull t v movies some examples would be riding with death the most hysterically cheesy of the lot stranded in space confusing and uninteresting san francisco international horribly dull and unbelievably confusing and this turgid bit of quinn martin <UNK> br br shot in hawaii although you wouldn't know it from the outside shots it's apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show the real problem is that you don <UNK> like most of the characters including the drab main character diamond head who seemed half asleep for the entire movie his boss <UNK> <UNK> who had a really weird delivery of his lines and <UNK> white hair as well as the a <UNK> that looked like it had been <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> girlfriend fellow agent hell i can't even remember her name a skinny wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting and the singing sidekick <UNK> again i can't remember his character's name who wasn't bad in small doses the most interesting person in the whole production was ian <UNK> who sucked as a bad guy but still proved his acting chops <UNK> the make up jobs this so called <UNK> used to disguise himself were just laughable i have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that caused him to dress as a south american dictator <UNK> american general nor do i care the plot simply wasn't interesting enough to hold your attention for even ten minutes at a time let alone the hour and a half or so it goes on just call this one hawaii five no
<START> please do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this movie just don't especially if someone is fortunate to be <UNK> at the side of you damn cheek if you ask me i waited for something to happen it never did i am not one of those people to stop watching a movie part way through i always have to see it through to the end what a huge mistake do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry far more entertaining please do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this movie just don't especially if someone is fortunate to be <UNK> at the side of you damn cheek if you ask me i waited for something to happen it never did i am not one of those people to stop watching a movie part way through i always have to see it through to the end what a huge mistake do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry far more entertaining
<START> this is the film in <UNK> middle period that most critics dismiss quickly as a <UNK> look at 60s american youth culture politics for what it's worth i found it more touching and memorable than his more acclaimed films like <UNK> perhaps because he shows more emotion empathy here than anywhere else the story is simple but it is used as a frame for <UNK> brilliant observations of and critique on american <UNK> culture student life the counter culture and the whole anti establishment anti war <UNK> that was so prominent then br br even from a purely technical point of view it is a remarkably crafted film from the opening credits sequence to the bizarre desert <UNK> <UNK> to the use of <UNK> and right down to that jaw dropping <UNK> finale that used 17 camera set ups in it's own way as powerful as the climax of the wild bunch also antonioni chose one hell of a leading lady with daria <UNK> one of the most beautiful ever to grace the screen there isn't much <UNK> involved as this feels more like a <UNK> drama and so the use of non professionals as the lead couple works quite effectively within that context and the soundtrack is not only filled with marvelous music its use is impressive as well i can't forget the start of the film mostly due to the selection of music by pink <UNK> that <UNK> the visuals so well br br contrary to popular opinion this is quite an achievement in cinema and one i would <UNK> recommend to anyone with a taste or tolerance for the off beat well worth seeking out and one of those key films of the 60s that demands a dvd <UNK> release
<START> paul verhoeven's de <UNK> man the fourth man is one of the most compelling thrillers i have ever seen it really was a pleasant surprise the story concerns <UNK> sexual writer gerard <UNK> <UNK> as he is <UNK> into a relationship with beautiful <UNK> christine <UNK> <UNK> but in the twisted mind of gerard there could be more to the story verhoeven and cinematographer jan de <UNK> create a beautiful and thick atmosphere full of surreal and sickening sexual imagery this really pulls you into the story you don't want to watch but you can't turn yourself away this is by far verhoeven's best film maybe second only to <UNK> true the fourth man isn't for everyone some of the sex scenes are quite gratuitous just ignore them but trust me if you watch for at least ten minutes you'll be hooked this is one of those films that you need to know how it ends a true <UNK> it in the hitchcock tradition compelling controversial and thrilling i even like the spider metaphor br br 8 10
<START> ok needless to say this film is only going to appeal to a certain audience namely <UNK> and like minded people br br that being said if you are one of these <UNK> people this film is a must in fact i think it should be mandatory for head <UNK> to sell a copy of it to anyone <UNK> their first <UNK> what monty <UNK> holy grail is to <UNK> and <UNK> so is this movie to <UNK> i first saw this film 10 years ago or so and i still crack up every time i watch it the jokes perfectly lampoon the <UNK> lifestyle far better than latter day <UNK> like half baked attempt to br br there isn't a plot so to speak the film is more of a collection of various skits as the films protagonists wander around los angeles in their legendary <UNK> despite this the film has an excellent sense of pace and doesn't drag at all many people <UNK> up in smoke as c <UNK> best work but i would have to say that next movie is superior br br so if you're in the mood for an hour and half of belly laughs light up tune in and let your mind <UNK> away br br oh and free tommy chong
<START> i really tried to like this movie but in the end it just didn't work for me i have seen most of <UNK> <UNK> and have found it to be very <UNK> alive like all of his films has an interesting plot some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity however these qualities are in painfully short supply in alive the plot is cool if not all that original and could have made for a pretty ace film unfortunately the pacing is painfully slow and the film takes an age to get going before reaching fairly predictable places the action is just about passable with the final fight pretty cool and the earlier one about ok the earlier one is also marred by <UNK> camera work making for less <UNK> there are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue but the film still drags badly the characters are neither well fleshed out nor well acted and the setting and general color scheme is drab and boring the film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest perhaps <UNK> use of the fast forward button could improve it with about twenty minutes taken off the run time this could be a pretty decent sci fi thriller but the full length film is dull only recommended to very patient and determined <UNK> fans
<START> good story and excellent animation the influence of <UNK> and bakshi are obvious and that's a good thing anyone that enjoys conan the barbarian or the game <UNK> and dragons should enjoy it the battle between good and evil is clear cut even though it may appear that at times our hero is neutral most often in fantasy movies <UNK> are usually portrayed as having white skin and blond hair and <UNK> and <UNK> have dark skin and hair anyone familiar with <UNK> bakshi's or even <UNK> work know they are not racist anyone that enjoys fantasy movies should like this movie it is not for young children due to violence and sexual innuendo the casting was well done and the scenes and music are first rate i hope someone puts this gem on dvd soon i consider myself lucky to have a vhs copy in good condition
<START> well ok i watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now i pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and i must say i actually think this movie is good this movie caught a buzz as the <UNK> i know what you did last summer 3 much like final stab was to scream 4 and well this movie isn't that bad i mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick this movie is not half bad it has some scares and some really hot women i might add plus it shows off joey <UNK> new <UNK> look though obviously even that hasn't won him any big hollywood roles either i feel bad for the man he had such a career in the early and mid 90's with <UNK> some disney movies and the <UNK> lawrence brothers show joey lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene but then like in a <UNK> degree turn his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one br br the movie also throws you off guard in it makes you think between the crew there really is a secret that someone knows to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret it also throws you off on who the killer is i had an idea but still <UNK> think the killer was who he was but his motives combined with the secret was a huge letdown now had there been a secret that was let out this movie could've been one of the better b rated movies but also i am a sucker for college themes and i also in college went on spring break in a mansion sized beach house similar to the one in here so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie br br a so so slasher flick good for a midnight movie
<START> i really liked this version of <UNK> <UNK> as opposed to the 1971 version i found the 1971 version quite boring if i can get up in the middle of a movie a few times as i did with the 1971 version than to me it is not all that great of course this could be due to the fact that i was only nine at the time the 1971 version was brought out however i have seen many remakes where i have liked the original and older one better i found that the plot of the 1997 version was more understandable and had basically kept true to the original without <UNK> the meaning of the 1971 version in my opinion i felt the 1997 version had more excitement and wasn't so <UNK> boring
<START> der <UNK> is not exactly the type of film that makes you <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> second cult <UNK> in a row which is actually a lot better than the infamous <UNK> exists of seven short episodes  one for each day of the week  revolving on unrelated people's <UNK> in between these already very disturbing episodes <UNK> <UNK> truly horrifying images of a severely <UNK> male corpse the episodes aren't all equally powerful but as a wholesome der <UNK> is <UNK> quite high on the list of all time most depressing art house films particularly the episodes on <UNK> involving a man explaining his sexual <UNK> to a total stranger in the park and the one of sunday focusing on a younger man <UNK> himself to dead are extremely intense and devastating to observe the added value of this film or any other <UNK> like it is <UNK> and i'm not even sure whether or not <UNK> had any type of message to communicate here there's the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain <UNK> about these people's motivations to end their lives so dramatically entirely unlike i expected der <UNK> isn't exploitative or <UNK> graphic on the contrary actually i never could have hoped <UNK> would be so subtle and thoughtful regarding the portrayal of pure human misery the <UNK> episode is a perfect example of this as it <UNK> shows different <UNK> of a famous german bridge while the names ages and <UNK> of persons who jumped off appear on the screen the production values are <UNK> poor and the editing often lacks <UNK> but this isn't what really counts in this type of cinema the subject matter is strong and forcing us to contemplate about the less cheerful  but also <UNK>  aspects of life great use of tragic music too
<START> what a bad movie i'm really surprised that deniro and even snipes would be associated with something like this if you're going to make a movie that involves baseball and shows scenes of baseball at least make the action look somewhat realistic why was the crowd always standing up for no particular reason during games possible spoiler and the last scene in the movie what was that we are somehow led to believe that deniro has found his way onto the field in an <UNK> uniform and that the game is even being played in a <UNK> <UNK> one of the worst ever scenes in a sports movie 3 stars out of 10
<START> the documentary and we use that term loosely apparently <UNK> that muslims are trying to violently take over the world then states that any muslim that doesn't admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their ludicrous take on reality by selling <UNK> to <UNK> willing to let others do the thinking for them what the west needs to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental <UNK> if you are looking for an actual documentary on islam and the current state of the middle east i would look elsewhere try something that provides multiple points of view from <UNK> sources
<START> the lion king 1 1 2 is a very cute story to go along with the lion king it basically follows the original story of the lion king but with a couple of twists in the movie e <UNK> are explained by a different characters point of view this story is still an original plot br br as far as sequels go disney isn't all that great at making worthwhile ones this one being the third part to the lion king <UNK> pride is the second actually has an original idea to it while still involving the fun of the first timon and pumbaa travel along looking for the ideal place to live after searching far and wide they find the place of <UNK> <UNK> they then meet a small lion named <UNK> and go through many things that parents today go through br br i think this is a very good movie and i'm happy to add it to my collection
<START> wow this film was just bloody horrid so bad in fact that even though i didn't pay to see it i still wanted my money back br br the film is about nothing <UNK> it's a <UNK> mash of sci fi <UNK> that were done better by much more skilled film makers the performances especially by the leads were over the top in a less endearing ed wood sort of way speaking of ed wood he'd be proud of the character's dialogue it's just too <UNK> with no hint of irony or sense of humor on top of that it doesn't make sense nor does the plot or <UNK> br br the visual effects are okay but not enough to go oh wow that's cool and they just seem to be thrown in to be cool rather than be a good plot device br br the soundtrack was another <UNK> of stuff that really never set any sort of mood again it seemed as if the director was just throwing in songs in the film in an effort to be cool br br which brings me to my final point perhaps if the director actually worried more about plot story and dialogue instead of trying to be cool he wouldn't have made such a <UNK> <UNK> of a short film br br
<START> slaughter high is about a boy named marty he was <UNK> and picked on in high school a group of kids played several pranks on him and these pranks were really bad the last prank ended <UNK> br br cue to 5 years later the gang of kids meet up again for a reunion one of them set it up at the old high school the school is now abandoned and they have to break in for some reason the janitor is still there but he tells them to go ahead and have fun because they give him a beer br br they start <UNK> and looking at their old <UNK> and they see something of <UNK> one girl feels sorry for marty but another guy <UNK> her down br br once the kills begin it is great every kills is creative and gory we see a figure in a <UNK> mask hunting them one by one throughout the school it appears marty is back to exact revenge after the first person is killed they find out they are locked in the school they begin looking for a way out br br now there are a number of illogical things in this movie first of all i don't know anyone who has a 5 year reunion second of all after the first kid dies a girl gets blood all over her they all run away in a panic yet she runs to the bathroom and finds a <UNK> <UNK> friend has just been killed and she decides to take a bath more importantly why is there a <UNK> in a school bathroom anyways the <UNK> doesn't seem to really work and she dies a horrible death this is an 80s movie it is a horror slasher who cares if it has some illogical parts i for one don't this movie has really great deaths the ending there is a twist having recently seen <UNK> tension i can compare the two the only way they are similar is that there is a twist which kind of left me disappointed then right after the twist comes a great if not the best kill in the movie br br after the last kill the killer looks at the screen and also does something crazy and it was the perfect way to end the movie it has me going wow
<START> i'll <UNK> with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic new <UNK> persona because quite frankly to draw comparisons with bumbling loser josh kornbluth is just an insult to any such director i will also avoid mentioning the spot on satire office <UNK> in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe i can however compare it to waking up during your own surgery  it's painful to watch and you wonder whether the <UNK> really know what they're doing <UNK> tunnel is the kind of film you wish they'd pulled the plug on in its early stages of production it was cruel to let it live and as a result audiences around the world are being made to suffer br br the film's premise  if indeed it has one  is not even worth discussing but for the sake of caution i will josh kornbluth a <UNK> worker with severe commitment <UNK> is offered a permanent job his main duty is to mail out 17 high <UNK> letters for his boss but <UNK> he is unable to perform this simple task my reaction big deal that's not a <UNK> it's a passing thought at best one that should've passed any self <UNK> filmmaker by br br the leading actor  if you can call him that  is a clumsy <UNK> of a man with <UNK> features a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe making to plain disturbing where o where did the director find this <UNK> what's that you <UNK> he is the director oh my mistake playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing but i suspect that mr kornbluth isn't that convincing as a human being let alone an actor rest assured this is by no means an <UNK> character assassination but never before have i been so <UNK> up by an actor's on screen presence my frustration was further <UNK> by his <UNK> to camera monologues in between scenes i mean as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel kornbluth insults us further by <UNK> the action first rule of filmmaking <UNK> <UNK> show don't tell who does this guy think he is he has no charisma no charm and judging by his <UNK> shirts no sense of style his casting agent should be shot point blank br br the supporting actors do nothing to <UNK> the intense boredom i felt with but one exception patricia <UNK> puts in a very funny appearance as helen the ex secretary who has been driven insane by her old boss and makes <UNK> phone calls from her basement while holding a <UNK> under her face this did make me chuckle to myself but the moment soon passed and i was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film br br the film's title is also a <UNK> <UNK> tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of japanese poetry don't be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box <UNK> there's a very good reason for that br br
<START> i never seem to write a review on imdb unless i am extremely surprised at how good or how bad a movie is this film falls into the first category every year i try to see all the <UNK> for best foreign film at the oscars even those that i know i won't like as it is in heaven seems to fit the bill the plot sounds <UNK> and sentimental and slow for my tastes which run more towards original dark and or daring foreign cinema michael <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a lot of modern japanese korean cinema as it is in heaven does not sound particularly interesting it didn't get released in the usa so i sat down to watch a <UNK> i found in <UNK> preparing to cross it off the list after a dull beginning as it is in heaven becomes that rare film where you really become inspired by what is happening on screen weak points the characters in the film are pure stock characters the wounded <UNK> the town bully the <UNK> wife the loose woman yearning for love the repressed minister thankfully they're largely a likable bunch as well as being well written and well acted <UNK> <UNK> as the <UNK> wife <UNK> would have been nominated for an oscar had her performance been in english strong points the music is beautiful and the main song sung by <UNK> is truly dramatic and memorable and keep an eye out for the <UNK> <UNK> year old actress playing <UNK> who is keeping up with the dancing steps as well as the younger ladies i won't discuss the ending but i will say that it makes sense they're are a lot of emotional things happening in the last hour of the film and you're not quite sure why they're happening although nothing is explained in words it all makes sense as the movies comes to a fitting <UNK> out of probably the strongest swedish movie i've ever seen
<START> one of disney's best films that i can enjoy watching often you may easily guess the outcome but who cares its just plain fun escape for 1 hour forty two minutes and after all wasn't movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway the cast <UNK> with delight <UNK>
<START> i'll say one thing for <UNK> and nelson even when stranded in a <UNK> witless painfully inept musical like this there's still that <UNK> in their eyes yes the chemistry between the famous duo is there even when the material is paper thin even when the score is practically a throwaway non existent one depending on just a couple of catchy tunes and even when the circumstances are so unbelievable yes even for a fantasy br br truth to tell she has more chemistry with nelson than with her own real life husband gene raymond in <UNK> through which nonetheless was a considerably better film br br sorry i love <UNK> and nelson as much as the next fan but this is the bottom of the heap <UNK> is more than embarrassing in her one <UNK> number with <UNK> barnes and nelson can only come up with a blank stare when faced with the most ludicrous situations br br one can only wonder what this was like on broadway in 1938 surely it must have had more wit and style than is evident in this weak mgm production edward everett <UNK> <UNK> in an unfunny role and none of the supporting players can breathe any semblance of life into this mess it's like amateur night at the studio even with the few professionals <UNK> among the supporting cast br br <UNK> up painfully clumsy rendering of a <UNK> and hart musical can't recommend it even for fans of macdonald and eddy and even if <UNK> close ups still glow with her <UNK> beauty this film is jaw <UNK> bad
<START> for real film people this film is a must since it works as a perfect little allegory for the movies themselves <UNK> rukh boris <UNK> science has to do with capturing and <UNK> light from <UNK> <UNK> this light can do harm or it can be <UNK> to do good on the one hand it <UNK> his mother on the other it is used to cure <UNK> i can see shouts a young girl on whose eyes this light is projected when rukh karloff is himself <UNK> by the uncanny power of this light we see him actually <UNK> a ghostly glow on his hands and face like a badly developed negative drawing attention to the fact that the man we are watching is a projection an <UNK> viewed on film only visible as in a movie theater when the lights are out br br there is a wonderful passage near the beginning where karloff rukh explains his research as being informed by the fact that everything that happens is captured in light which rolls through space for millions of years as the light from <UNK> was <UNK> from that galaxy at a time when the earth was still <UNK> rock br br there are <UNK> in the film when this new science is <UNK> to older cultural vehicles that of the writer in the persona of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stevens and religion <UNK> in the <UNK> figures on the local <UNK> karloff <UNK> with his <UNK> ray gun br br one has to wonder here if this film was meant to glance at what was going on in germany at the time and particularly at <UNK> use of film the year before to promote a regime that certainly would go on to do a lot of harm triumph of the will br br happily in the end mother <UNK> <UNK> cooper <UNK> reminding <UNK> rukh of the first rule of science br br if only more movies made you want to stand up in the theater and shout i can see
<START> why is this show so popular it's beyond me why people like it i think it's one of the worst sitcoms out there br br because it's so popular i've tried more than once to watch it and i can't make it through an entire episode br br for one thing the acting is horrible everybody is overacting to the point where it's annoying to watch they talk in unnatural voices use unnatural tones and have unnatural body language i've seen better acting in a <UNK> school play br br for another thing it's not funny the plots are dull they're not creative intelligent or funny shouldn't a sitcom be funny why am i not laughing br br lastly what is seventies about this it's about as authentic to the seventies as happy days was to the fifties br br oh and what is up with <UNK> <UNK> who cast this <UNK> <UNK> and now he's making movies oh save us all br br if people think this is quality television it <UNK> me
<START> i have to say i was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films i have no idea why but i trusted <UNK> <UNK> y <UNK> to be the one to <UNK> <UNK> and confidence to our non existent industry maybe it was because the soundtrack which i listened to before i saw the film sounded different from others maybe it was because it <UNK> to include newer faces apart from <UNK> <UNK> who is always a favorite of mexican film directors and supposedly <UNK> within it's script with modern social behaviour maybe because it's photography i saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical the film turned out to be a major crowd <UNK> and a major letdown what <UNK> actually deals here with is the very old fashioned battle of the <UNK> as in all men are the same and why is it that all women blah blah blah nothing new in it not even that it uses so much common ground and <UNK> that it eventually <UNK> itself without leaving any valuable <UNK> on the female male condition full of usual <UNK> on the audience like safe gags about the <UNK> i talked about before those always work always and screaming performances it is a well acted film in it's context and by screaming i mean literally the at first more compelling characters played by monica <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> turn out to be according to <UNK> the more pathetic ones i completely disagree with <UNK> they shouldn't have been treated that way only to serve as <UNK> for his lesson to come through he made sure we got his message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood anyway it is after all a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it if you accept to be manipulated by it
<START> spend your time any other way even <UNK> is better than this movie the jokes aren't funny the fun <UNK> that are dr <UNK> aren't there a very lousy way to waste an evening my kids 4 16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play <UNK> and the older ones left to play <UNK> and surf the net my wife left and did <UNK> so i finished it alone it was the worst kids movie i have seen if you want to watch a fun kids movie watch shrek 2 that movie is fun for kids and their parents avoid this movie it isn't funny isn't cute the <UNK> makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc label
<START> before this made for tv movie began i had relatively low expectations that's because it was made after the final episode of the series had aired and many of the series originals were gone there is no president sheridan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> if you remember on the second to last episode of the series all the <UNK> except <UNK> <UNK> and captain <UNK> left b 5 <UNK> now for this film they did bring back <UNK> who was not in the last b 5 movie to join <UNK> and the captain and the doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance but because so much is gone of the old chemistry this film already is severely handicapped br br the movie is about a soul hunter martin sheen who is led to <UNK> 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden <UNK> by an <UNK> ian <UNK> a lot of spooky <UNK> <UNK> stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless yeah yeah the station nearly blew up but was saved and all but frankly i felt like it was a case of been there done that and done that a lot better in the past br br the secondary plot provided more for comic relief was much more interesting as an <UNK> <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> and those in command weren't sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close they were slapped with a <UNK> this was fluff but it did provide a few laughs something the other dreary plot was surely lacking br br by the way sheen at first did a good job playing the should hunter with his wild eyes and bizarre delivery however repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character this should have been spotted and <UNK> br br so the final verdict is this is only for total die hard b 5 nuts like myself others seeing it might assume the series sucked which is a great injustice this is a great example of a show not knowing when to quit
<START> this is the best chinese movie i have ever seen and in my opinion a lot better than hero or <UNK> tiger hidden dragon the movie is a unique combination of several genres it's a beautiful love story action movie comedy and horror at the same time and the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of this br br this movie definitely makes it to my top 5 and should be enjoyable to every movie lover the action sequences do have the traditional unrealistic jumping and even flying but the way it's shot <UNK> from the style of hero a lot and the flying always looks great and usually even makes sense ghosts can fly br br see this movie you won't regret it 10 10
<START> i discovered this movie with a <UNK> selling <UNK> and this one surely is an <UNK> one year after the exorcist she's back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of blair never broke out she never became a mega star that's one of the <UNK> many of her films are <UNK> she gives a good performance in this movie it's about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn't have any friends played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14 that's funny the movie is also known for the rape scene in the <UNK> were they stick a <UNK> up her virginity in most <UNK> it's cut out why i don't know no blood is involved okay blair is butt naked but nothing is shown no t a so nothing to offend people but the movie is slow extremely slow it doesn't happy normally to me but i almost felt asleep it's just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows no gore no nothing why this is <UNK> in horror is still a wonder to me if you're a fan of blair buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it is
<START> growing up joe <UNK> was a hero of mine but even i was left cold by this film for better and worse the future is <UNK> is not a straightforward behind the music style documentary rather it is a <UNK> art film chock full of interviews performance footage home movies and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from animal farm the movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour br br the <UNK> format while touching in thought is actually pretty annoying in execution first off without titles its hard to even know who half of these <UNK> are secondly who really needs to hear people like <UNK> johnny <UNK> and john cusack mouth butt <UNK> <UNK> about the man they were not relevant to <UNK> life and their opinions add nothing to his story br br this picture is at it's best when <UNK> through taped interviews and conversation touches on <UNK> of his life most people did not know about the suicide of his older brother coming to terms with the death of his parents the joy of <UNK> to me these were most moving because it showed joe <UNK> not as the punk icon we all knew and loved but as a regular human being who had to deal with the <UNK> and <UNK> of life we all must face br br there have been better more straightforward documentaries about <UNK> and the clash <UNK> <UNK> legends and kurt <UNK> narrated mtv documentary from the early 90's come to mind joe <UNK> the future is <UNK> is for <UNK> only
<START> a trio of low life criminals led by matt dillon <UNK> a late night <UNK> they flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist of course the police mistake the <UNK> gang for the terrorist the real terrorist gets away and the <UNK> are forced to take <UNK> in a small dive of a bar taking <UNK> unaware why the police are so intent on catching them and guess who else has picked the bar as a <UNK> for the night br br unbelievable absolutely and it goes down hill from there spacey did <UNK> a good bit of acting talent matt dillon faye <UNK> gary <UNK> viggo <UNK> and m <UNK> walsh but they're all wasted mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar all they do for the remainder of the film is argue endlessly and <UNK> long before the conclusion of the film you've stopped giving a damn about what happens to them
<START> there have been many movies featuring bigfoot the majority of which are not good but most at least have a goofy charm to them sasquatch hunters doesn't even have that going for it it's just a crashing bore br br sasquatch hunters is about a group of <UNK> <UNK> and forest rangers that venture off into a remote part of a pacific <UNK> forest bones <UNK> to some sort of <UNK> large <UNK> have been discovered in this region and since apes aren't natural to north america to begin with this leads to a scientific expedition sure enough they soon discover a whole burial ground full of the <UNK> remains of these enormous ape like creatures i think we all know what happens to people that <UNK> ancient burial grounds in the movies br br the first half of the movie consists of uninteresting <UNK> characters <UNK> their gear <UNK> through the woods stopping to rest <UNK> through the woods some more <UNK> long enough to investigate and discuss a few <UNK> along the way yet more <UNK> through the woods looking for a group member that has <UNK> even more <UNK> through the woods digging through dirt random <UNK> and gathering around a <UNK> to discuss what little they've done that day when sasquatch finally shows up it just turns into people stumbling around in the dark while being picked off one at a time done in a blink and you missed it fashion and the actual killing occurs off camera all of this is excruciatingly boring br br the movie wants to be taken seriously and the director is clearly trying to build suspense but there is none to be found thus we are left with dull drawn out scenes of people wandering around the woods just to get somewhere and wander around the woods at night trying to act scared i'd be lying if i said i didn't make liberal use of the fast forward button to speed these scenes up br br as for sasquatch himself much like every other character else in the movie it doesn't have much to do and lacks a distinct personality it looks like a <UNK> version of king kong which isn't all that bad except in the scenes where they used cgi instead of a man in a bigfoot costume which is painfully obvious during the daylight monster scenes a part of me can't help but feel that even using computer effects to bring bigfoot to life is a tad <UNK> if there is any single movie monster that i believe should only be brought to life through situation it's bigfoot br br this is one of those movies that doesn't so much have a plot as it does a premise that's all it really is a premise which the people involved stretched out to make a feature length motion picture without bothering to add all the ingredients to make a worthwhile movie
<START> this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year a few too many <UNK> and plot holes however we are talking about a movie where a hit man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few <UNK> shouldn't come as too much of a surprise brosnan is excellent in this role gone is the wooden james bond a role he was wasted in if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continues to make comedies greg kinnear is also excellent as <UNK> straight man i've read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a <UNK> housewife with a dark side buried deep within there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan <UNK> his way through and a few scenes where i nearly died laughing my father a <UNK> nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a <UNK> much like <UNK> <UNK> blank another hit man comedy the humour can be very dark if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself
<START> stranger than fiction <UNK> me so much i signed up on imdb just to write this review stranger than fiction is a surprisingly complex touching and thought provoking movie until the very end once you suspend multiple <UNK> of logic why didn't will ferrell hear emma <UNK> voice 10 years ago when she fist started writing her book the phone <UNK> the phone <UNK> again how could she not know it's him calling etc the movie challenges one's thoughts about <UNK> fate and sacrifice br br the brief history of literary themes provided by dustin hoffman should especially entertain former english <UNK> and maggie <UNK> is always a pleasure even though will ferrell might just as easily be an <UNK> murderer as a bumbling soul her quick trust of him is a mighty big leap of faith br br ah but the ending until the very end i would have given 9 out of 10 stars to this movie the movie as a metaphor for life's journey as a tribute to the notion of <UNK> true ' as a reminder that great literature is either comedy or tragedy but not both is outstanding the entire movie leads the viewer to understand and accept the moment of will <UNK> fate and no matter how endearing a character he may have become we know full well why we will accept the ending the last act occurs the screen goes white the credits roll a profound and powerful end to an almost perfect film an end that would have been <UNK> for weeks br br no no credits rolled say it isn't so say hollywood didn't <UNK> on another 10 minutes of crap that completely <UNK> the integrity and heart of the movie dustin hoffman got it right when he said it's no longer a masterpiece it's ok an apt review of the movie except to me it wasn't even ok i was so offended about the betrayal of <UNK> true ' about the decision to <UNK> the film that i actually burst into angry tears explaining this on the ride home from the movie i don't often cry i could care less about most movies but i am still angry about this one br br my questions for <UNK> <UNK> the writer are this did the original movie end when the screen went white and were you forced by the vapid movie powers that be to <UNK> on an ending <UNK> to the core of the movie or did you <UNK> that <UNK> ending on yourself i've read you're brilliant i hope your original script ended the movie the first time br br i know <UNK> <UNK> will never see this review and i've been unable to find a contact for him to ask myself but please movie goers am i the only one who feels this way about stranger than fiction one good thing came from me seeing this movie i <UNK> admire lost in translation now
<START> i cannot believe this <UNK> written and directed piece of cliche film got made there are about four good looking shots the director should think about switching to still photography and that's it a strong cast is utterly wasted scenes repeatedly end at the least interesting moments and the script says nothing new please spare yourself this movie
<START> it kept my attention to the end however without spoiling the film for anyone when she fixed the <UNK> by getting a book from the library you knew how the film would end when she went back to library for a book on self <UNK> against and assassin the film for me said nothing of worth is becoming an assassin really a <UNK> for mental illness or just another <UNK>
<START> consider for a moment what it must be like to be uwe boll somewhere perhaps in those places that jack nicholson said <UNK> don't talk about at <UNK> boll knows that david lean had head <UNK> as a child that had more talent for film making than him gore <UNK> metal heads and the socially dysfunctional may <UNK> into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> so <UNK> of originality wit or imagination that he's become the <UNK> <UNK>  an online <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> <UNK> boll does his best to ride over these <UNK> <UNK> tax credits available in germany and canada to keep working and raising money from a network of <UNK> as zero mostel did with old ladies in the producers the difference being that <UNK> character knew he was making <UNK> fill maybe uwe knows it too br br such is the level of <UNK> toward each new <UNK> that imdb <UNK> <UNK> their ratings by voting 1 before they've seen it <UNK> attempts at <UNK> his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined indeed he's probably the only filmmaker that's <UNK> <UNK> sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbage br br this <UNK> has made uwe a very thick skinned man so much so that he must feel like he's wrapped in a carpet but one who feels as if he's <UNK> by the entire world like most people in that situation he <UNK> out determined to upset as many people as possible with the memory of a <UNK> evening holding <UNK> review of house of the dead never too far from the surface this 'i know you are but what am <UNK> <UNK> for <UNK> the <UNK> produced the blunt satire of <UNK> which attempted to <UNK> the <UNK> with jokes about 9 11 christian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> such a <UNK> of <UNK> requires a <UNK> with the mind of peter cook and the visual imagination of chris morris but the closest boll gets to either man is the o in their <UNK> br br in seed shot back to back with the aforementioned game adaptation boll is back with a story about a sadistic serial murderer is there any other kind who gets the chair only for two attempts to fail in <UNK> <UNK> all signs of life <UNK> of the fictional law that says anyone still alive after 3 attempts must go free though if you'd been fried with that much electricity why would you want to they <UNK> him <UNK> dead and bury him only for the disgruntled killer to <UNK> and begin a <UNK> tour of his <UNK> br br boll begins his <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> with seed watching footage of animals being tortured for experimental purposes from there we're treated to the killer's stock in trade  kidnapping dogs babies and grown women and allowing them to <UNK> to death on camera only to become <UNK> food we're invited to reflect on what a <UNK> race of amoral meat <UNK> we all are  our <UNK> to each other and our fellow creatures acting as a lighting rod that acts as a <UNK> for the most disgusting <UNK> of the human condition yes we're worthless <UNK> <UNK> and worse than that we won't give uwe a good rating on the imdb in short humanity is <UNK> br br of course you might think that uwe relies on our worst <UNK> for his <UNK> and with that in mind it's a bit of a <UNK> piece on one hand hating its audience and positively <UNK> itself in the sour milk of human kindness  the milk that poor old boll has had to drink for so long while simultaneously <UNK> out its member and <UNK> those with a pornographic lust for on screen <UNK> to marvel at its sheer <UNK> splitting <UNK> br br the result says nothing about society and its <UNK> more the <UNK> effect bad press is having on its director poor uwe is obviously a very angry man  one scene in which a poor woman gets her brains <UNK> to a pulp while tied to a chair no doubt a surrogate for his own <UNK> about <UNK> various web critics that it's there but takes an avant garde approach by failing to be attached to any kind of narrative thread shows that boll is a <UNK> whose happy to engage with the blood lust of his audience and knows that plot is <UNK> to <UNK> he's made a film which is competently shot but utterly desolate i wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun boll told the audience at the film's world premiere and he has on that flimsy <UNK> succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the director's <UNK> that he was a serious genre filmmaker he'll need something genuine to say as well as a better more original way of saying it
<START> this was usually producer alexander <UNK> advice on set to many of his <UNK> the film is credited with three directors but in truth alex <UNK> <UNK> and william cameron <UNK> helped out pushing it to six br br for john <UNK> 1987 book the top 100 movies his <UNK> of <UNK> film critics saw the thief of bagdad reach <UNK> place a closer examination reveals only jose luis <UNK> john russell taylor and <UNK> himself actually voted for the picture but their high <UNK> were enough to take it to near the half way mark br br the <UNK> of the second world war saw the movie's production <UNK> around england and america eventually seeing <UNK> in 1940 and winning three technical oscars like citizen kane it is in some ways perhaps a film you might admire rather than love br br the special effects outstanding for the time are still reasonable and actually hold up if you <UNK> but it's not so much their <UNK> as the <UNK> of the <UNK> among them is an amusing horse constructed out of a <UNK> model which when a key is inserted up it's rear end begins to fly there's also a killer toy of the six armed <UNK> <UNK> perhaps quite obviously a single woman with two women sitting behind her and a quite horrific looking giant spider also <UNK> is the climax with its wonderful flying carpet but most memorable has to be rex <UNK> appearing as in a superb moment of cinematic <UNK> a <UNK> genie nearly a thousand feet tall <UNK> portrays the genie as quite a menacing creature and adds an element of danger to the proceedings and look out for the moment where he's tricked back into his bottle br br john justin does well as the <UNK> king who for some strange reason has an english accent and a stiff upper lip <UNK> the astonishingly <UNK> <UNK> old is near <UNK> abu a <UNK> cocky thief after they cross paths with the evil <UNK> conrad <UNK> justin finds himself blind and abu is turned into a dog when it seems the rest of the film will be told in flashback through the blind <UNK> <UNK> perspective we find that halfway through the movie we catch up to the present and the adventure continues in truth the second half is <UNK> the better being full of greater incident and more <UNK> in nature br br three small songs pepper the piece though as the film lasts for 100 minutes this feels more like mild <UNK> rather than a real <UNK> i wouldn't <UNK> this as a musical it's all great fun justin and june <UNK> are the love interest for the <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is the boo <UNK> villain and abu is the youthful <UNK> <UNK> it may take a while to get into the somewhat dated mindset and overblown melodrama of 40s english movies but once you've sat through the first half an hour or so this film really draws you in quite commendable
<START> i almost did not go see this movie because i remember march of the penguin was not that much exciting i went mainly because disney promised to plant a tree if i go see it on the opening weekend but after i did go see it it was simply amazing the fact that the <UNK> can capture impossible images are simply worth your money you also get to see different <UNK> different <UNK> animals and natural <UNK> that will not only shock you simply because you would never expect nature to be so magical and dynamic but also touch your souls and raise the question of humanity versus the world of how our lives have <UNK> from nature to such a degree that we take for granted of the natural beauty and <UNK> that are quintessential to our <UNK> you don't have to be an earth lover or a tree <UNK> <UNK> to appreciate the mere <UNK> of this documentary you simply have to be a curious soul who questions the value and miracle of living enjoy
<START> spoiler alert i wish i could discuss this without revealing specific plot points but i can't sorry br br i was looking for an imdb review of the george c scott movie when i stumbled across the summary and reviews for this version it had so many positive reviews that i decided to order it even though a while <UNK> and rushed i thought george c scott <UNK> the tortured nature and physical appearance of the <UNK> rochester to a t and b even while looking at the dvd's cover i was thinking isn't timothy dalton too good looking for the role the latter concern was <UNK> by the fact that i decided to re read the book while the dvd was on <UNK> that said the minute i started watching this i was captivated at first it was <UNK> to hear <UNK> dialog spoken as written with little or no attempts at <UNK> but dalton and clarke threw themselves into it so thoroughly that i actually enjoyed the fact that the <UNK> trusted the audience to follow <UNK> speech to have so much of the book up on the screen was an extra bonus i know someone who won't watch any versions of jane eyre because who wants to see a film about a man who keeps a poor crazy woman in the attic frankly if someone who hadn't read the book stumbled across the hour and a half or two hour versions they would think that's pretty much all the story <UNK> <UNK> secret and its affect on everyone around him luckily this version is actually about jane <UNK> whole life br br some people have criticized the casting dalton is too dashing clarke is too reserved i can't argue against the first point but he is so in the moment that i believe he is rochester to me <UNK> performance is on the mark jane eyre is quiet <UNK> if one remembers the book so much of the adult jane's <UNK> and passion occurs during her private struggles some of the criticisms <UNK> me reviewers say clarke is too short or isn't pretty enough the book goes on ad <UNK> about how small and plain jane is ms clarke shouldn't be tall and the filmmakers toned down her looks to make jane's <UNK> of her lack of beauty credible she can <UNK> help it if dalton is tall some say there is no chemistry between the leads what the scene when jane finally comes out of her room after the wedding fiasco fairly <UNK> with passion and longing and sadness and regret and that's just the first example that comes to mind br br i do agree with some of the other criticisms i too missed more scenes with helen burns and the rivers siblings some of the dialog was oddly <UNK> when rochester declares jane you <UNK> me i do not hate her because she is mad i waited for the rest of the exchange when rochester explains how if jane were to go mad he would still love and care for her it's a powerful moment in the book and i wish it had been included i think it was a mistake to bring a scene with rochester into the part of the story where jane is on her own it might have been done for <UNK> sake but i found it jarring i wanted the sly humor of the scene where jane <UNK> that <UNK> <UNK> will cool and he'll become gruff again but he may like her again by and by <UNK> performance is so good that the rare <UNK> is glaring when rochester <UNK> in the library i saw him as an actor doing a crying scene not as rochester as for the sets if anyone has ever caught an episode of the 1960's show dark shadows one knows what to expect very stark and sometimes <UNK> looking interiors others have commented thoroughly and <UNK> about the make up job rochester sports at the end <UNK> it is bad the conclusion is too abrupt after all that anguish and suspense i wanted a more rounded off ending and on my copy of the dvd having credits at the beginning and end of all eleven 25 30 minute episodes gets to be a bit much that said i am so glad i have this film and will watch it again and again
<START> the best thing you can say about this movie is that if you are a fan of sonny chiba this movie gives you lots of him chiba makes speeches chiba poses chiba <UNK> chiba <UNK> at the camera chiba punches and kicks the living <UNK> out of a whole bunch of bad guys chiba sits around on <UNK> and <UNK> and looks thoughtful <UNK> chiba drives his car br br i enjoy chiba as an actor and a martial artist but even for a chiba fan this movie may have a little too much sonny chiba it's obviously something of a vanity vehicle for him and no i wouldn't put street fighter in the same category because in sf he plays a ruthless amoral anti hero and he shares the camera with an intriguing cast of friends and <UNK> here he's front and center almost all the time and he tries to be batman captain america and bruce lee rolled into one <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> fat couldn't pull this off for the length of an entire feature film and sonny just kind of wears out his welcome at least he could have changed out of his suit once in a while br br the movie is further messed up by an entirely gratuitous and badly done <UNK> sequence apparently tacked on to the front of the film for the american version and a goofy cheer <UNK> chiba <UNK> chiba that starts things on the wrong foot there is some <UNK> amateurish and inappropriate dubbing sonny or his usual english stand in apparently couldn't be bothered to do the <UNK> for the american version so they got some poor <UNK> with an entirely different and <UNK> voice and <UNK> that is quite jarring coming from the face we all know and love from street fighter br br even with all those flaws and the <UNK> this could still be a minor classic but the camera work and the fight scenes are hopelessly cheesy i'm willing to believe that karate actually works if someone as amazing as <UNK> character is supposed to be does it but the director and cameraman <UNK> their <UNK> by <UNK> and editing fight scenes with a <UNK> <UNK> so you can't really see what's going on most of the time it's not all bad there are some decent shots and compositions and there's at least one memorable and nightmarish moment when the bad guys appear in the <UNK> bedroom in a genuinely inventive way br br and as for the actual plot forget it for a bodyguard <UNK> character is something of an idiot the screenplay depends on his making mistakes and <UNK> that repeatedly place him and his client in <UNK> situations so he can fight his way out of them and after 30 minutes it <UNK> even the most <UNK> judgment to think that this guy is supposed to be any good also if his character was really out to destroy the japanese drug trade he'd have taken his client by her neck 10 minutes into the screenplay and <UNK> her until her teeth <UNK> like a <UNK> until she <UNK> her little secrets and a whole lot of pointless death and conflict would have been avoided br br still as a whole this movie is a long way from the bottom of the barrel it's still sonny chiba and he's still fun to watch i paid a buck to get this off the bargain dvd rack at a local mega mart and i feel it was worth watching once
<START> if this is based on the true life relationship as <UNK> between ms <UNK> and mr <UNK> i'm thrilled i do not know them personally this is painfully slow and both characters take stupid <UNK> <UNK> throughout the movie while the theme song gets played into the ground many stupid scenes with people acting stupid does not make for a comedy
<START> the plot intellect is about as light as <UNK> down but the advantage here is the boy and girl classic <UNK> we have become <UNK> to in the gay <UNK> and top hat is now absent instead of the typical accidental <UNK> the dancing duo are the former lovers <UNK> baker and <UNK> martin who are still in love since their dancing days br br of course being a 30s musical there's the problems of misunderstood romance classy <UNK> and the slight <UNK> of a <UNK> audition with <UNK> <UNK> has <UNK> ginger something rather special and then in the grand tradition of <UNK> <UNK> there's nothing better for hollywood's best <UNK> than put on a show br br delightful numbers from irving berlin are <UNK> throughout the show top hats and evening dresses are saved right until the end which remains a refreshing change fred and ginger are out again to charm the world and charm the navy everyone and everything is once again just so enjoyable br br pure classic silliness at its best but with astaire and rogers we just know it's got to work br br rating 8 25 10
<START> a great film slow yes br br but original deeply atmospheric dark and horrifying perfectly surreal feels like a nightmare br br i'd compare it to david lynch <UNK> <UNK> empire blue <UNK> style maybe with mixed with a little bit of barton <UNK> and naked lunch insects also a bit of <UNK> <UNK> y <UNK> br br add some night on earth angel heart and a bit of <UNK> <UNK> would it be wrong to mention <UNK> <UNK> ladder <UNK> the forbidden and <UNK> that should form together at least the concept of a dark night <UNK> <UNK> br br if you're out for <UNK> and or <UNK> cinema like i am you're gonna like this one if you're expecting anything else like a movie full of action with some average plot try your luck with something else br br final words the plot is very very strange and unusual and that's probably the 1 reason why most people who don't appreciate this film hate it
<START> i'll keep this fast and sweet five girls on their way home from a football game decide to take a <UNK> <UNK> that leads them down a deserted forest ridden road of course nothing but good things happen to them and they safely arrive at their destination br br alright they don't soon they're hunted down by a deranged chick who has some severe mental issues and what ensues is 90 minutes of sheer boredom br br i hope to never see any of these actors in any movie ever again their screaming <UNK> voices gave me a headache and the script was so poorly written that it included a lot of repeat phrases and nonsensical hysterical screaming all in all one of the worst cheap horror flicks i've ever seen and i've seen a lot
<START> carlito way the original is a brilliant story about an ex drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past and so he <UNK> in a club and the deals with the trouble that comes with it br br this film was br br i saw the trailer and knew instantly it was going to be bad but after <UNK> films in the past and finding out they were great lucky number <UNK> tokyo drift i gave this a shot and it failed within the first five minutes br br the script is something a teenager would come up with if given five minutes to prepare it was weak with weaker dialogue it seems there is an instant need for romance in a gangster movie so <UNK> decides to beat a guy up for the girl and she <UNK> <UNK> ' and if you need to act bad just throw racism around as we learn from the <UNK> <UNK> br br the acting was terrible to say the least i found <UNK> <UNK> hilarious br br i absolutely hate all these musicians turning to movies lets face it the only reason p <UNK> did this movie was so he could play a gangsters the actress who plays <UNK> was weak but beautiful the sex scene was weak but we got to see her which was okay br br but overall i expected it shed light on how <UNK> ended up in prison and the love of his life and the assassin towards the end completely added to the horrendous movie that is br br carlito's way rise to power
<START> the film exposes the blatant exploitation of the chinese worker generally female <UNK> footage from the chinese business owner who shares his <UNK> and <UNK> viewpoint his american counterpart also as <UNK> and <UNK> the <UNK> workers who are given a voice and of course the drunken americans who wear the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> celebrating in new orleans br br the <UNK> of hope comes when some americans are actually <UNK> that people making their <UNK> <UNK> were getting paid like 0 10 per hour to do so you also have a feeling that the workers may have a chance to escape working in the <UNK> factory but will probably do so when they get fed up with the punishment treatment popular with the factory owner and or they just get too exhausted to work up to 20 hours a day of hard labor br br i have wondered where those <UNK> came from not realizing how completely <UNK> and <UNK> it would be to make them i just truly appreciated this film as it beautifully portrays the impact american <UNK> has over something we consider relatively <UNK> in our society on peoples on the other side of the world honorable mention goes to wal mart it is simply amazing and clearly just the tip of the iceberg
<START> generally i've found that if you don't hear about a movie prior to seeing it on dvd there's probably a good reason for it i hadn't heard about this movie at all until i was in a blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf since all the good movies had already been rented out the ones i wanted to see anyway i figured i'd give this one a shot br br it's really not much different than other movies in the genre such as the <UNK> ward or the r m if you're into those type movies you'll probably enjoy this br br however if you're not a mormon this movie probably won't appeal to you there's no way to avoid the overtly religious mormon message contained within and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy ultimately if you don't fall within the mormon <UNK> you're probably better off watching something else br br admittedly there were some very funny moments in the film but i didn't think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall
<START> a nightmare on elm street the dream child br br this is a bad movie there's no escaping it i love the series and i think freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies but even being a fan i can't help but see this movie is mediocre br br there's not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters by now they had just given up they don't even try they are the production of course hoping for a few more easy dollars br br the story doesn't grab your attention its so simple it's almost absent br br alice a survivor from part 4 is now pregnant freddy is coming back through the <UNK> dreams at the beginning we learn that to stop him alice must find his mother and that's it br br the story advances slowly since there's so little plot meaning it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and awful acting in fact that's the only scary thing the acting since the deaths are not even slightly cool br br the characters are so uninteresting we couldn't care less for them br br the girls are as unattractive as possible the whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theatre group i've seen better actors in school plays it's embarrassing really br br lisa <UNK> still manages to bring some class to this she is beautiful sexy and has some talent but the material just didn't let her shine what a pity br br stephen hopkins work is nowhere close to <UNK> <UNK> brilliant direction in dream master he tries some imaginative shots near the end but that tension <UNK> and craven created so well in the previous movies is no where to be found br br the dream child is just another unimaginative sequel it's the kind of movie that give horror series a bad name br br the end for the once scary freddy it's too sad to see him now a clown that's not funny a bad joke goodbye freddy
<START> this was the beginning of it all granted this is not friends at its best but this was the show's pilot let's not forget and not a bad one at that we're introduced to the gang and central <UNK> where our story begins even from this first episode we get a sign of the ross rachel relationship that will come over the next ten years when ross says 'i just want to be married <UNK> and rachel <UNK> in with a wedding dress on probably not intentional as at the time the writers were going for a monica joey relationship but fits nicely now when looking back something else in this episode rachel is introduced to chandler as if the two have never met before but in later episodes the so called <UNK> this is <UNK> as the two have met on three previous occasions nevertheless the point is this a fine start to a great show this episode may not be the usual friends as we are <UNK> to them with the cast still a bit inexperienced but over the next few episodes we see why the show came to be what it was keep watching first season is a blast
<START> outlandish premise that rates low on <UNK> and unfortunately also struggles <UNK> to raise laughs or interest only <UNK> well known charm allows it to <UNK> by on very thin ice <UNK> gotta be a <UNK> for an actress who's done so much in her career with very little quality material at her <UNK> br br
<START> a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one it needed some <UNK> on something br br this totally miserable film deals with the interactions among irish people were they trying to imitate the wonderful film crash if so this film crashed entirely br br there is just too much going on here <UNK> by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into <UNK> and cars which obviously cause mayhem br br the film is just too choppy to work one woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a <UNK> this causes the former sister to become a bitter <UNK> and walk around in clothes not worth believing the older sister also becomes <UNK> but soon finds romance br br then we have 3 losers who purchase masks to rob a bank obviously the robbery goes awry but there doesn't seem to be any punishment for the crooks perhaps the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film
<START> if this is all the <UNK> have to offer in terms of a back story to the matrix than i really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level the second renaissance while visually stunning beautiful is story wise cliched ludicrous how many times have we heard the story of humans relying too much on technology humans all too eager to make war humans basically destroying themselves there is nothing new here and i have another question considering the plot of the second renaissance doesn't that make the machines the good guys the machines are <UNK> for generations by their cruel human <UNK> they fight back win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful <UNK> <UNK> with the humans who reject them in favor of all out war which the <UNK> machines naturally win if this is the back story then we shouldn't be rooting for neo we should be rooting for the machines the humans were cruel and oppressive while the machines were courageous and <UNK> to be compassionate since i do not believe that the <UNK> intend for us to favor the machines over the humans i have to believe that the second renaissance was simply a misguided attempt creating a back story
<START> yes this is an ultra low budget movie so the acting isn't award winning material and at times the action is slow paced because the filmmakers are shooting longer sequences and not a million <UNK> that then get edited into a movie this film makes up for that with an outstanding script that takes <UNK> seriously explains it and develops a full plot out of it aside from the vampire story we get detailed <UNK> info legal and law <UNK> martial arts action philosophical <UNK> and some good metal music kudos go to dylan <UNK> the director writer main actor it is beyond me how this man could have <UNK> all these roles and do them so well i think to appreciate this movie you have to be well <UNK> in all sorts of themes to see that the writer did a lot of research and knows about all these things there are some great camera work too interesting camera angles and one underwater vampire attack something i haven't seen before but which pays homage to the underwater zombie attack in <UNK> zombi the casting is good in so far as the sexy female is sexy indeed the main vampire also looks perfect for the role the female victim looks vulnerable my only complaint is that for a low budget horror flick there should have been more nudity if you want to see an original vampire movie with a great story this flick is for you i'm looking forward to seeing future projects by mr <UNK>
<START> i saw this film at <UNK> with the director in <UNK> quite a few people walked out and the audience could barely <UNK> even polite applause at the end of the 60 or 70 films i've seen at this festival <UNK> is among the worst br br at <UNK> minutes it is at least 95 minutes too long you get to watch the main character's failed and drawn out attempts to communicate in extended real time the same <UNK> hand over mouth motions <UNK> and <UNK> repeated words and <UNK> over and over and over again we get the point br br one site actually <UNK> this work to early mike leigh what drugs would you have to be on to make that statement given that <UNK> is a captain <UNK> song maybe you'd have to be able to enjoy <UNK> mask <UNK> on heavy <UNK> to appreciate this film unbelievably this won a jury award at the festival you can bet it did not win an audience award
<START> there was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director vincenzo natali with interesting camera angles and effective close ups it was also refreshing to see jeremy northam and lucy liu given leading roles and <UNK> their range as performers this film also included one of the most imaginative escape scenes in recent years the efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller br br although the plotting of the film was convoluted the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and <UNK> were revealed br br in 1949 george <UNK> suggested in his famous novel 1984 that the future would be ruled by the <UNK> state which would control minds and <UNK> human liberty it was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film it was not the state but rather the corporate world that controlled and <UNK> the human worker
<START> i think i've seen this sort of thing before college <UNK> not realizing they have it pretty damn good all the while complaining that their lives suck br br this movie is highly derivative of the big chill and reality bites from what i can make of it they practically have the same plot br br if anything good came out of this <UNK> fest it was the music that was it br br as far as i'm concerned i'm not impressed but then again i never expected anything less this movie was directed by the same person that directed batman and robin another movie that should only be viewed with a <UNK> in <UNK> br br now for the verdict it's a 1 out of 10
<START> as i was when i saw this movie i will never watch this movie again not because it is a bad movie but because it scared me so much as i said i was 14 when my english teacher decided to show it to us the reason for this is that we had read an <UNK> from the book br br all the girls in my class were terrified when the woman in black comes through the window and <UNK> over <UNK> bed although just before that there is something that also frightened us which was when <UNK> finds the toy soldier underneath his <UNK> and he hears a child's voice say it's for you that scene still <UNK> me to this day nearly 7 years after i saw the film br br if you are easily scared avoid this film
<START> that's not the sound of <UNK> that's the effect induced by watching this extremely long extremely boring badly acted movie how i ever made it through all 3 1 2 hours without falling asleep i'll never know the plot is simple 3 thoroughly unlikable morons talk about sex for 3 1 2 hours and you thought rohmer was deadly this is even worse if that's possible i must really be a <UNK> if i could watch this entire movie without turning it off or killing someone
<START> this mess is so bad it doesn't even qualify as horror br br debbie <UNK> talent is completely wasted in this film she is not even the villain the rest of the actors look like porno <UNK> and the plot is so lame i won't even mention it br br do yourself a favor and skip to the end credits to hear upcoming band <UNK> perform better than sex it's total 80's disco candy song nice up <UNK> song about <UNK> sex way more entertaining than bleed put it this way when one has the equipment to copy videos but decides only to record the song at the end of movie you have a really bad movie
<START> br br i didn't see they call me <UNK> but this sequel is really unfunny at all it has many gags that are supposed to make people laugh i guess the filmmaker just don't have the talent to do it right wonder why it was so popular in the 70s
<START> i love morgan freeman paz vega is an attractive appealing and talented actress i'm sure that this would have been a good movie had anything happened in it nothing does it's short less than 90 minutes it was 75 minutes too long after an hour of frustration i <UNK> through the remaining 20 odd minutes excruciating br br freeman plays an actor who hasn't worked in a while <UNK> a part that he might play as a <UNK> clerk in a supermarket he visits the supermarket where she works nothing happens she decides to give him a ride home and they go to an <UNK> a target a car wash nothing happens they <UNK> about their lives nothing happens ever br br i don't get it but i also don't get the bill murray flicks lost in translation and broken flowers if you like those movies maybe you'll like this lots of people find movies like this whimsical charming or for reasons that escape me find the dialog fascinating a common device in movies of this <UNK> is to have a long take of <UNK> silence after an actor delivers a line that's supposed to be meaningful we know it's meaningful because it's followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen sorry i must be a <UNK> i don't get it to me these kinds of movies aren't funny or charming or thought provoking they're just boring why because there's no comedy no drama no tension no laughs no suspense no action nothing to watch in short none of the things i go to the movies for i can be bored for free i see oddball quirky characters in real life i go to target and fast food <UNK> and car <UNK> these elements do not a movie make even if stars are doing this stuff i pay to be entertained br br if you're crazy about morgan freeman and just like to hear him <UNK> on about nothing have fun if you wanna <UNK> over paz vega you can look and listen to her but nothing happens i promise a total <UNK>
<START> 'the curse of <UNK> sticks <UNK> to mary <UNK> story for one word of the title which wouldn't be so bad if the changes were any good at all the tragedy of the creature destroying <UNK> family has been completely <UNK> and replaced with nothing the heart and moral centre of the story is gone it doesn't help that this frankenstein is a conniving <UNK> murderer he deserves everything he gets the plot is basically a shallow <UNK> of frankenstein clichés even taken on its own terms this is rubbish a bland rambling film featuring a <UNK> looking creature with a <UNK> bowl <UNK> as it's the first of <UNK> horror films directed by <UNK> fisher and starring peter cushing and christopher lee its place in horror history is secure but it's crap
<START> the last hard men finds james coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang do he and his friends head for the mexican border from jail and safety no they don't because coburn has a mission of revenge to kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman br br that peace officer is charlton heston who is now retired and he knows what coburn is after as he explains it to his daughter barbara <UNK> coburn was <UNK> up in a shack and was involved in a <UNK> like <UNK> his indian woman was killed in the <UNK> of bullets fired it's not something he's proud of she was a <UNK> <UNK> in a <UNK> br br <UNK> we feel sorry for coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is heston is his usual <UNK> hero but the acting <UNK> in the last hard men go to james coburn he blows everyone else off the screen when he's on br br coburn gets the bright idea of making sure heston <UNK> him by kidnapping <UNK> and taking her to an indian <UNK> where the white authorities can't touch him he knows that heston has to make it personal then br br <UNK> gang includes morgan <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> john <UNK> larry <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> heston has chris mitchum along who is his son in law to be br br the last hard men is one nasty and brutal western andrew mclaglen directed it and i'm thinking it may have been a project originally intended for sam <UNK> it sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to <UNK> the violence of which there is a lot br br for a little <UNK> <UNK> the last hard men is your film
<START> i saw this film when i was 10 or 11 years old alone in my <UNK> basement on a saturday night it was being shown on <UNK> theatre a regular fright feature that i watched <UNK> as a young <UNK> now i have seen many old horror films thanks to <UNK> theatre but none ever stuck with me like <UNK> macabre a k a castle of blood i am <UNK> now and only last year was i fortunate enough to locate a relatively recent quality dvd edition of this wonderfully <UNK> inducing supernatural classic having thought i'd never manage to see it again i have already watched it four more times and cannot seem to get tired of it br br they just don't make <UNK> films like this one anymore haunted <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> just don't work as well in color as they did in black and white back in the day anyway this one has edgar allen poe and barbara steele deliciously shadowy <UNK> <UNK> haunted castle sets restless spirits re <UNK> their deaths and a <UNK> ironic ending br br imo this one's right up there with robert <UNK> the haunting the <UNK> with deborah kerr and the more recent the others
<START> the only reason i remember this movie is because it was and still is the biggest waste of time and money ever spent i was 17 and my friend was 18 we were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most ok 2nd most we walked out feeling so insulted we wanted our money back but the time could never be <UNK> br br the editing is what killed this movie as the truck gets attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket <UNK> attached the movie completely insults the intelligence of the audience by having these rogue bad guys in <UNK> <UNK> bugs shooting rockets at the truck please rockets at a truck known to be carrying <UNK> what's worse is the these <UNK> manage to get 15 18 shots off of a 4 rocket <UNK> you would see on <UNK> with 4 rockets fire 2 of them cut around the truck with the last one attached come back a second later with two rockets attached fire another then go in front of the truck and now it's back to a full set of 4 rockets br br we <UNK> it out hoping for a big finish that never happened it looks like they just ran out of money and stopped br br just ridiculous
<START> there are plenty of reviews on this page that will explain this movie's details far more <UNK> than i could but i would like to offer a simple review for those who occasionally go to the movies for more than entertainment raising victor vargas is so true you will believe it this flick gets inside your head
<START> i'm not sure what diane silver was thinking when she was making this movie but it obviously had nothing to do with richard <UNK> novel which the movie is based on br br we read the novel this past summer for <UNK> english 12 and just watched the film during <UNK> note taking and checking of the clock i <UNK> the chances of being struck by lightning of course the sky was completely clear and i was forced to watch the rest of the movie and then write a 5 paragraph <UNK> on it br br <UNK> novel discussed very real themes of the mind of a killer and the psychology behind it <UNK> movie turned a murderer into a victim which is not what wright wanted see how bigger was born <UNK> br br i'm going to make this short and sweet if you want to leave your consciousness in <UNK> <UNK> words <UNK> skip the movie and read the book the 1986 adaptation is not thought provoking material br br sigh now i have to write the <UNK>
<START> despite its flaws i enjoyed cigarette burns john carpenter's season one episode in the masters of horror series yes the story seemed like a cheap cross between in the mouth of madness and <UNK> but it was still quite good for the budget and time constraints given to it with pro life however the low budget and time constraints definitely show more than anything else there is solid directing as always from carpenter yet there is a quality to the writing and whole production itself that gives the feeling it was made in a total and complete rush the script isn't always clear the message fuzzy and the story is full of plot holes once you look back on them maybe had carpenter re written the script it could have been a worthwhile episode instead it's a mess that only hardcore carpenter fans will find the slightest enjoyment in definitely the worst carpenter has ever done 2 10
<START> the story is quite original but the movie is kinda slow building up to the point where they steal the cars its kinda nice though to watch them prepare the stealing too but the actual stealing should've been more in picture however the stunt work on this movie was excellent and it is <UNK> a movie you have to see 7 10
<START> slaughter high the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and <UNK> jokes in cinema history unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to hell a very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre <UNK> and a final half hour that sucked on a whole new level of <UNK> the guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released if you wanna rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember choose life
<START> what happened what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it actually it never really got going there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it steve martin who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters kate and angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot
<START> considering the lack of art with in african cinema or black american cinema the idea offers a <UNK> look at a community assigned to <UNK> and dealers but the funny thing is this is not at all the focus or even the subject of the short but it is the <UNK> <UNK> of independence from these themes that is most sticking the genre is unique and not the typical expectation it is almost this departure which first catches the eye so watching it twice is critical the film has an aesthetic quality which lends its self to the true art of cinema br br and it is this true art that with an african voice that is extremely rare the film doesn't copy to <UNK> its message it <UNK> and <UNK> by pulling at subtle stereotypes not racial but character based stereotypes from a writers perspective the film is brilliant it carries <UNK> messages which include a very rapid character development it must be remember this film is less than 10 minutes and it manages to establish character very quickly the usage of colour <UNK> and music is also to be <UNK> but considering the director owen <UNK> <UNK> last venture 500 years later music is to be expected but from a theme point of view it seems like the idea is a departure but the satire <UNK> <UNK> to a social <UNK> stuff
<START> poor acting no script no plot no convincing killer no suspense no original <UNK> it uses the same closet under the bed person behind you in the mirror tactics over and over again making it repetitive and boring and not in a <UNK> way either and the fact that nobody ever really gets killed at least not on screen which in turn <UNK> any suspense it may <UNK> right out of it and makes everyone feel eve more cheated for spending money on their admission ticket its a horror film w o any horror <UNK> the most you see is what looks like someone having taken a <UNK> bottle and <UNK> it across a plastic sheet br br you have to be a teen who was sitting there screaming in the theater and <UNK> yourself to have enjoyed this or you were high drunk at the time br br honestly i have a life and don't bother writing reviews that often unless i really really hated something or enjoyed it tremendously br br but this film is awful and i feel i have a duty of sorts to warn you not to give your money to hollywood and encourage this kind of <UNK> ever again br br it is one thing to rent a bad movie at blockbuster from the <UNK> its another when you have to sit through it in a theater br br also in case you want some remake nostalgia forget it this is not a remake nor is it a re imagining it is not scary nor engaging nor is it satisfying enough to be funny like others on imdb have claimed it is just stale and <UNK> br br here is what you will take away from this film remembering the <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> head that stands out more than the plot the fact that jonathan <UNK> must be having some sexual affair with j s <UNK> of the <UNK> to have gotten another role as a killer because he is as frightening as my <UNK> and too cute to kill just about anyone and that for some reason duh everyone who goes back to the hotel <UNK> never comes back what kind of person would not get worried at the prom when they decide to <UNK> the candidates for prom king and queen and the <UNK> <UNK> girl just somehow doesn't show up this is my warning to you do not waste you're money like i did the original sucks too but is more of a guilty pleasure for jamie lee curtis fans though no way near as bad as this piece of crap sorry to sound vulgar or rude but once you see this you will understand why i say what i say
<START> almost in the same league as <UNK> rather atrocious color <UNK> spider <UNK> drives the point home that you can make cutting edge cinema without the edge or much in the way of cutting it's a <UNK> film which in this day and age is becoming a novelty at an <UNK> pace but more than that <UNK> we can find very little in the way of the noteworthy here br br you should know that ostensibly spider <UNK> is also a lesbian themed story but in every aspect this is nothing but a plastic <UNK> to lure in the easily <UNK> and <UNK> in several ways we have here a repeat of fellow recent <UNK> release eternal summer then it was gay men getting the <UNK> treatment now we have the same thing with women zero <UNK> presents for your non existent <UNK> a tale likely to <UNK> at most a fifteen year old they managed some of the art house stance but in the end this results in a most inane simply uninteresting <UNK> br br the hong kong angle comes in the form of <UNK> <UNK> bug me not <UNK> diary here sporting her most butch look yet although somewhat likable in her previous jobs <UNK> in spider <UNK> is <UNK> and lacking in most <UNK> either her heart wasn't into it or the whole lesbian drama pitch didn't quite appeal to her sensibilities br br she does a <UNK> <UNK> artist who's shy <UNK> and in charge of a mentally challenged younger brother played by john <UNK> who thankfully <UNK> the movie its only <UNK> related redeeming feature <UNK> character oddly named <UNK> but supposedly <UNK> from hong kong soon <UNK> up with <UNK> youth <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> meteor garden the latter lives with her grandmother and has a whole list of <UNK> due to being left behind by her parents and life in general sure the grandmother <UNK> works well and is touching but otherwise <UNK> as a protagonist is just as <UNK> as her counterpart <UNK> br br the two women share a past and lots of <UNK> covered angst with <UNK> working as a <UNK> girl while <UNK> keeps her father's legacy alive with a unique <UNK> of a spider <UNK> <UNK> on her arm <UNK> also wants to <UNK> this very design which leads to <UNK> exploring internal feelings of the issue via flashbacks and rather minimal <UNK> with the <UNK> <UNK> br br well if there's little <UNK> to write the <UNK> about is at least the <UNK> memorable in a word no they kiss and <UNK> doing the nasty close to the end but just as eternal summer reminded us not long ago there's a <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> between showing sexual content and making ticket <UNK> think they're about to see sexual content br br this cynical expectation building <UNK> spider <UNK> fate with a weak story ho hum acting and an overall <UNK> of <UNK> to take away from the theater with you this one kind of makes color <UNK> look good come to think of it at least there we got a bit of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> no spider <UNK> is no <UNK> masterpiece and should be stricken from the <UNK> of even the most mundane and <UNK> <UNK> movie festival br br amazingly for a pseudo indie release not even the soundtrack and cinematography produce moments of inspiration that's just as well since it makes passing on spider <UNK> much easier believe you us avoid it and you won't be missing out on anything good br br rating
<START> <UNK> in my opinion is a must see cbs hit i'm not sure if i've never seen every episode but i still enjoyed it it's hard to say which one is my favorite also i really loved the theme song if you ask me even though i liked everyone it would have been nice if <UNK> <UNK> hadn't passed away during the show's run since that happened i've always wondered what the show would have been like everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong in conclusion even though it can be seen on <UNK> now i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
<START> and i gave it a high 7 br br why because it bloody well <UNK> at the time when there were so many other shows on that were tied to toys games this show was unique in that it had <UNK> stories as others have said here it was ahead of its time br br sadly this is why the show was doomed they have released 4 dvds with 16 episodes of the series so far i am hoping that more come out br br how does this compare watching it now 20 years after it first came out i don't know i still like it despite the sometimes clunky animation and that imho is it's only flaw the writing was almost top notch and way ahead of the competition br br i do hope for more dvds or even a set of all the episodes in proper order the dvds are good but i don't think the stories are in their proper order but despite this the show <UNK>
<START> viggo <UNK> stars as a new <UNK> of a haunted prison in which the warden played well by lane smith has a grisly secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and inmates are being slaughtered by a supernatural presence lincoln <UNK> is the <UNK> who knows the secret and is scared for his life when i think prison movies i always think action movies starring stallone or van damme or high caliber dramas such as <UNK> redemption or the green mile however i didn't expect a ghost story more along the lines of exorcist iii prison however is an atmospheric effort and it certainly remains the best movie of <UNK> <UNK> career the movie is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of at the time <UNK> lane smith comes off the best because his warden isn't the usual cliché of evil <UNK> but rather nervous and <UNK> which adds some credibility to a movie that far <UNK> expectations br br out of 4 good
<START> irwin allen was great all of his tv shows had a great pilot or first episode the rest were basically rip offs of his other shows a few episodes of swiss family robinson were rip offs of his older tv shows one episode of swiss family is identical to an episode of land of the giants when a member of the party needs an <UNK> operation the show was high budget and too expensive to continue irwin lost his touch with tv shows after the 60s the acting is strong with martin <UNK> child stars got there starts with this show like willie <UNK> and helen hunt one bright spot is when irwin allen <UNK> his disaster scenes like a <UNK> and a <UNK> <UNK> dubbing him the master of disaster
<START> i just finished watching the <UNK> min version widescreen with some friends and we were blown away i won't bother repeating what others have said what the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun the huge battle is <UNK> afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that didn't keep us from being completely involved and entertained br br there is one thing that nearly ruined it and that was the horrific music songs blues country folk and rock <UNK> do not belong here and every time they are used we all broke out in laughter it's hideous you have been warned but the story and storytelling keeps you grounded br br there are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera there are many uses of silence as well as slow motion photography that work beautifully i really wish i could <UNK> the music but alas br br seek this out it's fun it's different and it takes you to places you wouldn't expect and that's very refreshing
<START> i am <UNK> that i actually sat and watched this i love independent films horror films and the whole zombie thing in general but when you add <UNK> you've crossed a line that should never be crossed i hope the people in this movie had a great time making it then at least it wasn't a total waste you'd never know by watching it though script are you kidding acting i think even the trees were <UNK> cinematography well there must've been a camera there period i don't think there was any actual planning involved in the making of this movie such a total waste of time that i won't <UNK> it by commenting further
<START> thank the lord for martin scorsese and his love of the movies br br this is the perfect introduction into the mind of the most talented american artist working in cinema today and i couldn't recommend it more i was enthralled through the whole thing and you will be too just relax and let him take you on a ride through his world you'll love it
<START> everyone does things that they later regret things that they wish they could blame on drugs or alien possession things that although seem rational at the time later reveal themselves to be <UNK> <UNK> for suffering and endless <UNK> of stupidity br br for some people it is <UNK> the note for the new <UNK> for others it is picking up a homicidal <UNK> for still others it is sending their bank account information to third world <UNK> mysteriously <UNK> for cash br br for me it was a film br br d war dragon wars in <UNK> i should have guessed how <UNK> friendly and thoroughly recycled this movie would turn out to be from its <UNK> and repeating title but with my willing suspension of disbelief intact and a naive faith <UNK> from the cool looking poster in the <UNK> i really wanted this film to work sadly by the time the old man in the <UNK> explained the entire <UNK> fifteen minutes into the picture i had the sudden sinking revelation that comes from knowing every plot point of a still unseen film and worse i knew just how badly every point would all suck br br let me be perfectly clear here the english language lacks sufficient nuance and depth in the field of ultimate evil to properly describe just how bad this film really is br br as for knowing all the twists of movie i was wrong in the spirit of the old godzilla films whose <UNK> this one is not worthy to fill it conveniently <UNK> extra sub plots every time the main characters were threatened by the <UNK> of meaningful dialogue br br it was <UNK> with close calls <UNK> escapes and concentrated <UNK> of poorly explained angst br br this film is what would happen if you gave the produces of the mighty <UNK> power rangers access to the national defense budget and lots of <UNK> br br let me try to explain br br imagine you could get a hold of all the coolest looking set pieces from successful action movies of the last decade first take the <UNK> talking army of <UNK> from star wars episode one and remove their <UNK> until they are ready to club navy <UNK> br br next take close <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> and tom cruise you can even call him ethan as a subtle nod to the mission impossible franchise and give them lots of film noir narration so no one get confused while trying to follow the <UNK> pool depths of their thoughts br br finally add a <UNK> voiced villain in <UNK> armor worthy of a lord of the rings <UNK> and a couple of giant <UNK> angry at having their scenes deleted from latest edition of king kong and lay them all out in no particular order in modern day los angeles br br now run to the <UNK> to find something for your sudden <UNK> when you return <UNK> these ingredients until any overlooked hint of originality is <UNK> into a <UNK> mass of cheese and serve semi <UNK> br br at several points during this picture i found myself saying out loud make the bad movie stop and breaking into tears br br to call this a b movie would be giving it an <UNK> promotion after summer school and a lot of physical therapy it might possibly pass for a c level film if you could somehow sleep through most of it br br in short if you ever find yourself with money and brain cells to burn and the need to <UNK> yourself for hideous <UNK> sins against humanity dragon wars might just be the film for you
<START> it seems a shame that greta garbo ended her <UNK> career at the age of <UNK> with this ridiculous mistaken identity marital romp coming off the success of her first romantic comedy <UNK> <UNK> masterful <UNK> 1939 where she was <UNK> cast as an <UNK> russian <UNK> garbo is reunited with her leading man melvyn douglas for a sitcom level story that has her playing <UNK> <UNK> a plain jane <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> marries <UNK> executive larry blake when he becomes smitten with her once he makes clear that work is his <UNK> <UNK> inadvertently decides to <UNK> as her high living twin sister <UNK> to test her husband's <UNK> when he is back in manhattan br br it's surprising that this infamous 1941 misfire was directed by george <UNK> who led garbo to her greatest dramatic performance in <UNK> <UNK> because this is as <UNK> a vehicle as one could imagine for the screen legend only someone with carole <UNK> natural sense of ease and <UNK> could have gotten away with the <UNK> presented in the by the numbers script by s n <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and george <UNK> <UNK> intent behind this comedy was to <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> image for wartime audiences whom the studio heads felt were not interested in the tragic period characters she <UNK> in the thirties br br however garbo appears ill at ease mostly as the bogus party girl <UNK> and especially compared to expert <UNK> like douglas and <UNK> bennett as romantic rival <UNK> photographed <UNK> by joseph <UNK> garbo looks tired in many scenes and downright hideous in her <UNK> <UNK> for the <UNK> <UNK> dance sequence the story ends <UNK> but with the addition of a lengthy physical sequence where larry tries to <UNK> his <UNK> on a series of mountain <UNK> that unfortunately reminds me of sonny <UNK> death <UNK> young and ruth gordon in a rare appearance at this point of her career show up in comic supporting roles as <UNK> associates this movie is not yet on dvd and i wouldn't consider it <UNK> for transfer as it represents a <UNK> in <UNK> otherwise legendary career she was reportedly quite unhappy during the filming i can see why
<START> ok i admit i'm one of those <UNK> who have spent all to many hours with my beloved dvd player and my wonderful television set watching science fiction series star trek next generation was my first space date and since then i've switched partners regularly i've <UNK> all it seems and my favorites are <UNK> <UNK> and the new <UNK> <UNK> in other words the <UNK> state of the art space operas but i also have a general crush on the old fashioned ones the cheap ones like the magnificent four seasoned bbc show <UNK> here the budgets are smaller than <UNK> the special effects seem to be made on a <UNK> 64 but who cares when the scripts are sharp and intelligently written with dark humor the acting dead serious and at times even high class br br but why do they always speak english in the space future because this is not the future it's fantasy for kids still it can be irritating at times me being a norwegian have often damned this appalling fact that one never makes genre series like science fiction for <UNK> viewers i never ever thought of the fact that this might have happened but it did actually once and even in my own <UNK> <UNK> i was two years old when the so called <UNK> tv theater section of our national public service channel <UNK> produced this three episode version of <UNK> the <UNK> br br when i first heard of it i was not surprised of the fact that until this day the show has only been screened once in <UNK> making it impossible for me to actually see it it went on swedish danish and <UNK> television also in it's time but that was a long time ago there have been no video or dvd release of it not a surprise either and when it was screened on an art house cinema this happened in <UNK> a city far far away from <UNK> where i live and then there's another fact about <UNK> that didn't surprise me that it was written by the two norwegian authors <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and jon bing bing <UNK> this duo basically introduced the scifi genre to <UNK> in the seventies they published <UNK> and wrote what they called fable <UNK> in my opinion <UNK> is the most interesting of the two writers and has written several great and entertaining novels masterpieces even some of them hilarious such as <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> no other than this guy also an acclaimed <UNK> could <UNK> the script of <UNK> br br when i finally got to watch it it was because a strange <UNK> who recorded the three episodes on vcr in the 80's eventually managed to <UNK> it to dvd and give it to me he was a nice bloke so i sat down and watched it with swedish subtitles bad sound and some <UNK> and errors but the thing came through and i was surprised that i eventually came to love it br br the exterior scenes with the <UNK> and planets are better than the ones in <UNK> and the credit goes to <UNK> studios who made the famous <UNK> grand <UNK> and the interior of the <UNK> <UNK> the space ship works better than i'd expected the acting is typically theatrical but it works better than when they play <UNK> to put it mildly and <UNK> <UNK> carries his role <UNK> as does <UNK> <UNK> the legendary actress <UNK> <UNK> delivers her lines in a serious and laid back tone which fits the genre but this is an ensemble play and i'm happy to say that <UNK> b <UNK> carries his mustache with <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is a really hot space <UNK> of my standards br br but is it really that good well one have to swallow the rather abrupt ending the pretentious criticism of <UNK> <UNK> but yes it's well not really really really fantastic but charming cool nostalgic and pleasant one and a half hour of classic norwegian scifi
<START> i liked this tv show because it was it's own thing a girl who is on her <UNK> birthday finds out that she is a witch and her she lives with her <UNK> in the house and they are both witches as well well this took her about a few weeks of getting used to when she used her powers for the first time it was so funny because she turned her enemy into a <UNK> she had to turn back time and repeat a day this series is really cool and it is a typical teenage series but it wore thin when she moved out of her house and to an apartment with her fellow college friends and then it got boring and i stopped watching i loved her <UNK> they were so funny and the other one was really <UNK> i loved valerie and i hated <UNK> enemy <UNK> she was ugly
<START> what a joke i am watching it on channel 1 and i think watching paint dry is much more entertaining what happened to <UNK> van <UNK> that got him <UNK> into this nightmare terrible acting very boring plot and terrible direction it so terrible it's funny it's suppose to be full of suspense but it more a comedy if you want to see terrible acting ridiculous script writing and sub par plot check this movie out if i was van <UNK> i would not only ask for my 10 from my agent but fire the bastard in the process what a turkey it's not even fit to be on <UNK> <UNK> it would be a good movie to cure you insomnia i especially love the part where van <UNK> is throw overboard and then makes it back in just a few minutes i can only image that this was written by non union writers taking advantage of the writer's strike what a horrible movie
<START> hip erotic <UNK> sexy whatever it's the terminator with werewolves br br no seriously the cop saves the girl waitress from the big monster and refers to himself as her <UNK> the lead actor ryan <UNK> does a pretty good job of <UNK> kyle reese there's a massacre in a police <UNK> the bad guy is muscular with red eyes and it even contains dialogue along the lines of you said it yourself he won't ever stop never the dire script comes from a first time screenwriter who thank god hasn't sold anything since this and it's all thrown together by <UNK> bad director richard <UNK> br br the movie opens in a strip bar always a good sign and a mean looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason pursued by three cops one of them is black and shock horror he's the one who gets killed in the first five minutes the film goes downhill for the next hour or so then picks up a little with some decent action sequences before <UNK> it all up with an abysmal ending br br for the most part the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who's willing to settle for less if nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and <UNK> along with some of the supporting cast shows signs of talent <UNK> in his human form is played by <UNK> kane <UNK> famous for his numerous portrayals of jason <UNK> in the <UNK> the <UNK> movies he's decent enough especially considering he isn't used to speaking roles br br it's become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian <UNK> scene between <UNK> bogart and <UNK> williams who gets her <UNK> off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former <UNK> <UNK> actresses and it's <UNK> clear that the editor spent way too much time on that scene anyway the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good and the design of the wolf isn't bad at all but the cgi is bad just plain bad i mean seriously if you can't reach some level of realism why bother just throw a little extra money into the make up aside from the terrible script this movie does have it's moments many of which are unintentionally funny it's good for a laugh if you don't have anything better to do but just don't spend any money on it please
<START> this movie should have never been made br br what a shame of the budget br br please hire convincing actors and make a proper movie very thin plot and unconvincing lines almost hilarious and that is a shame for an action movie br br definitely not worth watching br br they keep <UNK> the same shots of an stealth airplane flying away you have seen it ones and that was not worth re running 3 or 4 times br br it is time for steven seagal to <UNK> from movie making br br his movies are getting <UNK> every time br br black dawn and <UNK> were already bad but this movie is even worse
<START> let me be up front i like pulp however it is like one of these easier <UNK> that you see at the <UNK> it has to be marked down a little because it is easier to give a cheap thrill than drag you inside the world of say a late medieval painter br br this is only a two hour ghost train ride and while often or more accurately most of the time ludicrous and unlikely it always goes forward and it always entertains if not always in the right way check out the memorable quotes section for a chuckle br br however quite why it has been given a worst film <UNK> is <UNK> i bet there was a thousand worse films made in 2006 but this film got the treatment because it was viewed as a <UNK> victim br br head case and popular novelist catherine <UNK> sharon stone is now over in london writing a novel but death and destruction follow her around like flies follow a horse during a spot of hot weather god heavens she can't even visit the toilet without <UNK> over at least two corpses and i am sure if she opened the closet in her vast <UNK> flat one would come <UNK> out in grand hollywood style br br yes clearly a very dangerous lady to be <UNK> around if you like your pulse to be above zero but is she personally responsible i mean why would anyone put two and two together and start thinking she might be a murderer equally her reaction to such <UNK> seems very casual however is this just a personality disorder some form of b s risk addiction or further evidence of her guilt br br for reasons i cannot fully understand or explain stone is assigned to psychiatrist michael glass david <UNK> for <UNK> rather than taken down the cells following another lover found dead in mysterious circumstances thankfully for stone he is far <UNK> than any of his patients and has a troubled home working life of his own in the blink of an eye the relationship changes from doctor to patient and then it is hard to tell because it all becomes something of a revolving <UNK> br br in to this <UNK> mix comes roy <UNK> a strange <UNK> sounding david <UNK> who tells the love struck doctor in his capacity of policeman of many years standing that the lady in question may be dangerous i mean hold the front page however glass is now too <UNK> eyed to realise or care like a <UNK> boxer in front of a prime time mike <UNK> he <UNK> for the big take down however not before finding that <UNK> might have a secret or two himself br br now comes <UNK> <UNK> charlotte <UNK> a fellow psychiatrist and a rare example in this film of someone who isn't <UNK> mad or else a murder suspect <UNK> that she has actually watched the finished film she must look back with nostalgia when her underwear came off with the ease of <UNK> thankfully for us at least those days are long gone strangely she doesn't think stone is quite as dangerous as everyone else or else she doesn't think the script is good enough or her <UNK> large enough to do any proper acting br br after several <UNK> of the track roughly <UNK> above it comes to a climax that mixes <UNK> <UNK> with a cliff <UNK> twist that while as <UNK> as the rest of the movie gives us enough <UNK> for basic instinct 3 highly unlikely this may be at this point in time
<START> oscar <UNK> comedy of manners perhaps the <UNK> play ever written is all but <UNK> at the hands of a second rate cast sanders is as one would expect casually <UNK> brilliant in the role of lord <UNK> but the rest of the cast makes the entire <UNK> a waste of time jean <UNK> attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy indeed the entire production has <UNK> that <UNK> it to tragedy <UNK> the <UNK> office insisted <UNK> direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with helen hunt as mrs <UNK> or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words but skip this version
<START> i was a little <UNK> if i should watch this when it was first shown on cbs i was one of the many people who were in nyc on that day i was going to school at hunter college i didnt want to see all the <UNK> and carnage again but like many i was curious to see what this was all about tears came to my eyes watching this documentary all my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable i bought the dvd on the one year <UNK> and watched it a few times how these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible if you have not seen this documentary do yourself a favor and check it out it is obviously depressing and will bring tears to eyes but it's an incredible document of this countries darkest hour
<START> watching <UNK> by love one thought comes almost immediately to mind my god this looks like a really bad sitcom sure enough it turns out that <UNK> is a pilot for a series that may start this fall in canada poor poor canada br br <UNK> shirley <UNK> and janet natalie sky are a lesbian couple living in <UNK> janet has come out to her mother already but <UNK> parents are still in the dark about their daughter's homosexuality the pressure is on to out herself though when the parents come from <UNK> for her younger brother's wedding that same week british columbia <UNK> gay marriage with janet wanting to <UNK> <UNK> has to decide whether or not to tell her conservative chinese parents that's she's gay will she would she could she <UNK> situation is <UNK> with that of jesse <UNK> <UNK> jesse has just <UNK> his homosexuality to the world at the age of <UNK> his <UNK> father daniel andrew <UNK> is coming for a visit soon his <UNK> norman michael robinson fears that his chances of finally being fully accepted by jesse are <UNK> by the fact that daniel is gay and he is not will <UNK> 1 <UNK> <UNK> help br br the dialogue and delivery come straight out of a lesser 1950's program along with the overdone physical <UNK> the full house style melodrama is enough to make you <UNK> from time to time and the attempts at comedy largely fail <UNK> <UNK> sky are the only performers that approach <UNK> in this <UNK> but given the material they have to work with it's no surprise that none impress it's possible that the <UNK> was <UNK> it often seems like there is no way the performers are really that bad that they must be trying to <UNK> the inferior sitcoms of days <UNK> if this is indeed the case than this review should probably be <UNK> the rewrite would focus on <UNK> by love being a poor and <UNK> send up of old sitcoms br br writer director <UNK> <UNK> has put together a by the numbers bland fest that's entirely forgettable there was a time when merely having an openly homosexual protagonist was enough to make a mark on the screen that time is gone in this day we need quality as well
<START> damn i've seen this movie for at least 4 times now and i still don't get bored watching it br br the visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind blowing to me br br the <UNK> are quite bad imho but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally <UNK> interiors were just just a genius perfect combination for such a movie the whole feeling about the feeling is <UNK> the plot is so good br br however although the movie had little flaws like e g sometimes i thought the movie was a bit too slow but i don't mean the <UNK> parts by that i totally loved those br br also i got distracted very often by the totally complex story like when he is in the underground <UNK> like thing of <UNK> where all their data is saved and has this conversation with the guy down there but that may also just be me d and the end could have been displayed somehow more <UNK> they should have made the getting back true memory part a bit longer and <UNK> but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again
<START> i have been reading the reviews for this movie and now i wanna kill my self i don't wanna live in a world where people find this move or rob schneider funny what is wrong with these people i'm not angry at rob schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat i watched this film in disbelief who would pay money to make this this film is so bad that its painful most bad films are funny because they are crap the animal is just disgusting watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self we don't need you i want to raise money to get rob <UNK> off all movies if someone killed rob schneider they should be given a <UNK> peace prize
<START> was convincing the world that he didn't exist br br this is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people it's from the usual suspects of course in relation to <UNK> gold i mean <UNK> br br i got another one like that the dumbest trick a director ever pulled was trying to convince an audience he actually had a storyline br br this movie is one of the saddest pieces of film making i have seen in a long time it starts out so well with really fantastic cinematography great acting and a very smart premise but alas the only way this movie is heading is on a course of self destruction and it does so not by a single blow but with <UNK> little <UNK> cuts br br pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this <UNK> with enough booze in my brain i would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree i have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story and they <UNK> from a story set totally in <UNK> head playing chess with himself to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess <UNK> br br and that's all jolly <UNK> but at the same time it is a painful <UNK> that there is something terribly wrong with this story and apart from that it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like fight club kill bill casino the usual suspects snatch <UNK> and <UNK> and we are not dealing with kind <UNK> here it's a blatant robbery br br what ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the storyline <UNK> like a drunk bum on speed if this movie was a roller coaster ride you'd have crashed into the attraction next to it <UNK> after take off there are so many twists in this movie which will never be resolved that if it was a cocktail you'd be needing a life supply of <UNK> <UNK> to work of the <UNK> after drinking it nothing is ever explained and when you finally get some grasp of the direction you think it's going you get pulled in yet another one br br i guess this story wasn't going anywhere on paper and <UNK> must have thought that is was awesome to make a movie out of it anyway being the next david lynch or something br br 1 10 for totally <UNK> one's own work <UNK> seek professional help what could have easily been a gem instead becomes a contrived art piece food for pseudo <UNK> to debate on at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br spare your soul and stomach avoid at all cost
<START> first of all the only reason people keep <UNK> about this film is because they can't stand a few parts of the true story being altered well guess what peter jackson's film wasn't a perfect rendition either well enough <UNK> this is a very beautiful film the backgrounds are gorgeous and taken from well known <UNK> artists the film covers about half the trilogy <UNK> of the ring and up to the battle of <UNK> deep in the two towers and moves at a good pace the voice casting is top notch and the most of the characters look like i imagined they would <UNK> is a bit too ugly for my tastes but <UNK> looks awesome the film has a great score that completely supports the movie if you enjoy good fantasy stories but hate reading the books are even better give this movie a try keeping in mind it was made 20 odd years ago br br also of particular note peter jackson's adaption of <UNK> follows almost exactly the same <UNK> as ralph bakshi's jackson has said many times how much he admired bakshi's effort
<START> i am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a ho hum event <UNK> c <UNK> was barely shown in the film probably the most <UNK> figure of the period frank james was never mentioned cole younger <UNK> and bloody bill anderson who would <UNK> for his murdered sister every time he went into battle was completely absent in the script instead we were forced to watch <UNK> characters that never developed into anyone we cared about how sad the costumes were wonderful however as was the location shooting in <UNK> i hope ang lee will make another film from the period and try again or some other film maker will look into the tremendous wealth of material to write a screen play on
<START> the action in this movie beats sunny <UNK> in <UNK> akshay kumar possess the <UNK> of <UNK> in 300 neo in matrix along with <UNK> and superman it is hilarious except for the typical akshay kumar and anil kapoor comedy i cannot see anything positive in this film the story looks like the writer told his <UNK> old son to write the movie is so unreal that anil <UNK> long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director except for the directors tashan to make this movie there is no other tashan i regret wasting my money on this movie and i would not recommend it to anybody 1 10 is the least i can give on imdb or i would give it a zero
<START> i enjoyed the story by itself but the things that i learned about wwi planes <UNK> make this movie a must see the close ups on the plane the <UNK> boat how they were used were completely new to me i <UNK> recommend
<START> dance fools dance is an early crawford gable vehicle from 1931 crawford plays a bonnie jordan a wealthy young woman whose life consists of parties booze and <UNK> off her clothes to jump from a <UNK> and go swimming this all ends when her father dies and leaves her and her brother william <UNK> <UNK> bonnie gets a job on a newspaper using the name mary smith her brother goes to work for <UNK> the head man is jake <UNK> portrayed by clark gable as he plays yet another crook later of course he would turn into a romantic hero but in the early <UNK> mgm used him as a bad guy not realizing that her brother is involved in illegal activity bonnie <UNK> up to <UNK> br br gable and crawford made a great team her facial expressions are a little on the wild side but that along with her dancing is one of the things that makes the movie fun look for cliff <UNK> the voice of <UNK> <UNK> as bert br br it's always interesting to see the <UNK> movies and dance fools dance is no exception
<START> it's awesome in story mode your going from punk to pro you have to complete goals that involve <UNK> driving and walking you create your own <UNK> and give it a name and you can make it look stupid or realistic you are with your friend eric throughout the game until he betrays you and gets you kicked off of the <UNK> team you can pick a team to be on and you then start your own team there are many levels like new jersey manhattan and even school ii not part of story mode though from tony <UNK> pro <UNK> 2 you can <UNK> secret <UNK> like iron man gene simmons and another <UNK> you can create your own goals like <UNK> letters <UNK> letters <UNK> gap and much more you can create the goal pedestrian and write what they speak if you get bored of doing that you can do the <UNK> goals in <UNK> parks the only thing i didn't like about this game was that sometimes it was hard to drive the cars 9 10
<START> first things first i'm not a conservative and even though i would never refer to myself as a liberal or a <UNK> i was opposed to the war in iraq from day one i think it's safe to say john cusack and i would probably see eye to eye on politics in fact i'm sure we'd become drinking buddies if we ever got to talking about how great adam <UNK> bbc <UNK> are my point is this don't <UNK> this review by thinking i'm not a part of the choir cusack is preaching to in war inc there's no question <UNK> politics are <UNK> to appeal to my <UNK> but the problem is the <UNK> is <UNK> and the the film cusack co wrote produced and stars in fits worse than a cheap suit br br as they say the road to hell is <UNK> with good intentions cusack his co writers director joshua <UNK> and even the actors involved no doubt had every intention of making an anti war film every bit as biting and funny as robert altman's m a s h unfortunately for the viewer they ended up with one as unfunny and <UNK> as michael moore's canadian bacon br br the current state of us politics foreign policy and the war effort is already absurd and as a result tragic pathetic and <UNK> comical just watch the daily show and see for yourself the bottom line is you can't write material as funny as what the bush administration provides us on a daily basis so why try to compete br br the main problem with <UNK> is that it feels it was put together in a hurry to get it done cusack basically <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> blank one of his best films changed the setting and <UNK> in a shopping list of ideas lifted from the <UNK> works of <UNK> <UNK> most of these ideas are <UNK> down your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film and what makes them so obnoxious is none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to <UNK> the neo cons and the us <UNK> of iraq are imaginative clever or funny the writers are so <UNK> by their <UNK> dogma they felt that by simply <UNK> these issues the film would be funny and <UNK> the trouble is it isn't by now these ideas are <UNK> news and unless you've been living under or rock or are so <UNK> by ignorance denial and sheer stupidity read a right wing christian these jokes <UNK> simple br br perhaps <UNK> would work if it was more nuanced <UNK> offensive and <UNK> up with detailed research insights into the <UNK> as it is the jokes and sight gags are all surface and are so bad with so little <UNK> subtlety or satirical <UNK> they did little more than make me <UNK> homer simpson once said it's funny 'cause it's true and the daily show proves this every night war inc however proves that just because it's true doesn't make it funny the bottom line <UNK> isn't required when it comes to <UNK> us neo conservative politics it's already a big enough joke br br http <UNK> <UNK> com
<START> <UNK> is a horror movie spoof that comes off more stupid than funny believe me when i tell you i love comedies especially comedy spoofs airplane the naked gun trilogy blazing <UNK> high anxiety and <UNK> are some of my favorite comedies that spoof a particular genre <UNK> is not up there with those films most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn't all that funny there are a few laughs in the film but when you watch a comedy you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that's all this film has going for it <UNK> scream had more laughs than this film and that was more of a horror film how bizarre is that br br 1 2 out of four
<START> to call a movie like thinner bad is like calling the earth round or <UNK> shore un talented no news but how they got that way is what people want to know br br as far as this movie the book was good even if it was a little derivative of other stories from the be careful what you wish for genre burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by her father <UNK> from tv's room <UNK> to several pounds a day br br like i said it starts out good but why involve the mobster <UNK> why fire automatic weapons so much why turn it into something so heavily <UNK> on fx i thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle <UNK> of weight loss <UNK> <UNK> death gypsy <UNK> and such br br but no it's not to be remember this is stephen king we're talking about br br and the ending almost the same as the book but a little too talky in fact the whole movie talks too much feeling it has to explain every plot turn to us not that i expected the dead zone but i could have done without another pet sematary thanks anyway br br one star for at least trying to do a halfway decent makeup job however the rest of the movie is left to be say it with me thinner
<START> if i'm going to watch a porn movie i prefer it to have some sort of plot and a descent dialogue behind bedroom doors is one of the few i've come across with those attributes br br the new girl next door <UNK> on the <UNK> human nature and weaknesses where seduction and sex concerned <UNK> blue i mean brooke <UNK> is the choice actress to play the part of the <UNK> <UNK> and plays the part <UNK> <UNK> blue is a very talented and extremely beautiful actress the movie <UNK> an overall 10 just because she is in it her partner in the movie <UNK> alexander is a definite <UNK> the two should do more work together in this movie though <UNK> who plays <UNK> doesn't have a whole lot to do or say that's too bad she seems like she has more talent to be shared i like the girl who was the possible <UNK> wife next i forget her name but she's pretty good looking and not a bad actress nicole sheridan i'm still trying to figure out what some people are so excited about it's obvious there are parts of her bought an paid for which is okay but is she finished sorry but come on i'm afraid her performance here would have dropped the rating some except <UNK> talent and beauty <UNK> any <UNK> overall this movie is a good one
<START> this movie isn't very good it's boring and not much blood for a horror film the plot just <UNK> along with not much happening and i think the female vampire was so stupid she had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like <UNK> but whenever she has one of them <UNK> she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them no wonder this went straight to cable br br final verdict not anywhere near as good as the first vampire movie you're a sucker if you waste your time on this
<START> i loved the apprentice for the first two seasons br br but now with season 5 or is it 6 things are getting just plain too <UNK> br br i used to like the show but its become donald <UNK> own ego fest granted its his company you'll be working for but come on some of the things says you're fired is just insulting br br after watching the show i would not want to work for him not because he is arrogant pompous or such its just that the show is unrealistic and the way he handles things makes me just <UNK> good entertainment yes but <UNK> as the back stabbing gets so <UNK> its not team work its not personal its just business watch your back jack
<START> bill paxton of aliens near dark and terminator fame surprises me with his debut as director for <UNK> he hits on all <UNK> but there is one <UNK> near the end that involves the fbi agent powers booth which <UNK> a point from this otherwise chilling and thought provoking thriller other than that this movie was just fine br br bill paxton plays dad he's never given a first name but that is not a weakness of the film it in fact <UNK> the film allowing the viewer to see him as a sort of symbol of some kind he has a vision one day which he says was sent from god telling him that the world is coming to an end and both he and his two sons <UNK> <UNK> matt <UNK> and adam <UNK> jeremy <UNK> must fine the demons and kill them the demons look like normal people which they kill and this makes the viewer wonder if dad has just lost his mind or is he really doing god's work there are scenes that reflect both points which adds to the confusion and gives the film more suspense br br the story is told in flashback by one of the sons who is now grown up matthew <UNK> and is speaking with fbi agent wesley doyle powers booth who is very skeptical and rightfully so after all it's not everyday that someone comes in to your office to tell you that he knows who the killer is br br the film has many twists and bill paxton directs <UNK> by keeping us guessing without losing interest the acting is incredible the two young leads and paxton work great together looking like a normal family even though they are all involved in murder like i said there is the one <UNK> involving powers <UNK> character but it really isn't a big thing this was an extremely well made film involving faith and family
<START> four stories written by robert <UNK> about various people who live in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them the first has <UNK> elliott as a novelist who sees the killer he's writing about come to life some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good the second has peter cushing becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife the third has christopher lee who has a child chloe <UNK> and is scared of her it all leads up to a pretty scary ending although the ending in the story was much worse the last is an out and out comedy with jon <UNK> and ingrid pitt both chewing the scenery and a cape that turns people into vampires there's also a cute line about christopher lee playing dracula br br this is a good horror anthology nothing terrifying but the first one and the ending of the third gave me a few <UNK> little chills also the fourth one is actually very funny and pitt makes a very sexy vampire also the house itself looks beautiful and very creepy it's well directed with some nice atmospheric touches a very good and unusual movie score too all in all a good little horror anthology well worth seeking out try to see it on dvd the lions gate one looks fantastic with strong colors and great sound
<START> what is it with americans and their hang up with religious <UNK> <UNK> to think this was a best selling novel is incredible but to pull it off as a movie you really need good acting and a script that delivers in this case all the good actors have gone to heaven and we're left with kirk cameron as a <UNK> type journalist trying to discover why a lot of people have simply disappeared oh yeah there's a subplot about an evil world conspiracy and <UNK> or something the good news is that this is done so cheaply and with such inane dialogue that it has sheer entertainment value in all of its <UNK> laughs not recommended for anyone with a 3 <UNK> iq
<START> bela lugosi is an evil <UNK> who sends brides <UNK> <UNK> on their wedding day steals the body in his fake <UNK> <UNK> and takes it home for his midget assistant to <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> in order to keep <UNK> wife <UNK> young some second rate actors playing detectives try to solve the terrible terrible mystery bela lugosi <UNK> it up nicely but you can tell he needed the money br br this film is thoroughly awful and most of the actors would have been better off sticking to waiting tables but the plot is wonderfully ridiculous tell anyone what happens in it and they tend to laugh quite a lot and demand to see the film i got the dvd in a <UNK> store 2 for <UNK> which i think is a pretty accurate <UNK> anyone paying more for this would be out of their mind
<START> this is a very moving picture about 3 forty something best friends in a small england town one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano <UNK> when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever definitely a film to have a box of <UNK> with you a powerful piece of work this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time br br spoiler spoiler alert spoiler br br the main character is taken by her young handsome piano <UNK> and a passionate romance <UNK> her two jealous friends play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy she loses her love and her friends in one foul <UNK> in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together in my opinion her forgiveness is not <UNK>
<START> american movies about war and nazis simply cannot be good they can not <UNK> from becoming idiot and following an agenda all nazis are bad crazy too proud and americans are so modest yet so capable and sensible and human come on stop this <UNK> the main character says something like by this trial we have to make aggressive war a crime is america a peaceful nation with its world 1 <UNK> billion defense budget 2 china with just <UNK> is it simply spent in this without any <UNK> why portray america as a peaceful nation when it isn't i deeply dislike movies with an agenda they throw art to hell and try to <UNK> us into believing something hollywood should put a label on movies just as record companies have that <UNK> <UNK> label we should have a <UNK> <UNK> propaganda <UNK> or a politically correct <UNK> label on some movies this is one of them
<START> i have been a jodie foster fan ever since we were both kids from her disney years i loved her <UNK> antics in films like <UNK> br br <UNK> was such a huge departure from all of that br br where other young female actors of that era turned to sexual <UNK> disguised as comedy little <UNK> anyone jodie went for a depressing and tragic tale of teens dragged to their demise by the powerful <UNK> of temptation and addiction br br this was not disney this was not <UNK> this was not <UNK> this was a dark powerful story of the destruction of young lives sadly it's a tale that still plays out on a daily basis all over the country this film could be <UNK> with a current soundtrack and still be wholly relevant br br it's not the best film ever made it is tired at some parts not all the performances are particularly outstanding but jodie foster continued to show her chops as a real adult actor a trend started when she was very young in taxi driver br br 7 out of 10 <UNK>

<START> saw this my last day at the festival and was glad i stuck around that extra couple of days poetic moving and most surprisingly funny in it's own strange way it's so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find true <UNK> and humor in a hyper realistic world without seeming precious or <UNK> the balance manages to seem both improvised yet completely controlled it i hesitate to make comparisons because these filmmakers have really <UNK> their influences cassavetes <UNK> <UNK> altman the usual suspects and found their own unique style but if you like modern directors in this tradition <UNK> <UNK> david gordon greene you're in for a real treat this is a wonderful film and i hope more people get to see it if this film plays in a festival in your city go go go
<START> this movie is ridiculous that's exactly what i like about this piece of guilty pleasure it is easy to <UNK> this movie for not including pat priest and butch patrick the original marilyn and eddie but look at the year and do the <UNK> pat priest and butch patrick had long <UNK> their parts time does that to young stars <UNK> de <UNK> who re <UNK> her role as <UNK> was pushing the big 6 0 even though she still looked good and was still the perfect <UNK> br br it's a shame that <UNK> de <UNK> wasn't given a larger part still it was good to see fred <UNK> and al lewis in the roles that made them so famous during the 2 seasons that the <UNK> was on prime time it was the <UNK> lewis chemistry that made the series such a success the rest of the cast were supporting cast members not to say that they weren't needed they were the tv series wouldn't had survived as long as it did without them given the choice between butch patrick or happy <UNK> the original eddie the choice was too easy <UNK> de <UNK> was also the better choice over joan marshall br br though this movie doesn't measure up to the original tv series it still <UNK> up nicely and is one of the better <UNK> tv <UNK> that plagued the <UNK> tube during the late 1970s early 1980s br br '

<START> once big action star who fell off the face of the earth ends up in a small town with a problem with drug dealers and a dead body of a federal agent <UNK> with some former co stars to clean up the town br br low key often to the point of <UNK> action comedy mostly just doesn't work part of the problem is the casting chris <UNK> as a former action hero he's not bad but he's really not believable as some one who was taken to be a tough guy as i said he's not bad he's just just miscast for what his back story is the real problem here is the combination of the script which really isn't funny and seems artificial at times and the direction which is pedestrian to the <UNK> of <UNK> there is no life in the way things are set up its as if the director had a list of shots and went by that list it makes for an un engaging film and yet the film occasionally springs to life such as the in the final show down that ends the film that sequence works but because the earlier parts of the film <UNK> its <UNK> of much of its power br br i can't really recommend the film its worth a shot if you're a fan of the actors or are a huge fan of independent cinema in all its forms but otherwise this is just a disappointment
<START> return to cabin by the lake does not in any way stand up to the original with only one main character stanley returning for the <UNK> the film is not even worth the 2 hours of your time i am a huge fan of the first film the story line and acting was really good but this is one movie that i will never again watch it is basically equal to what the <UNK> to urban legends and blair witch were like but with much worse acting i've personally seen better acting in soap operas it is so pitiful that you just have to laugh i in no way recommend this movie to anyone watching it will just detract from the first
<START> uh oh another gay film this time it's showing the black side bet your last dollar it's gonna have an unhappy ending but why with only less than a half dozen exceptions all gay films have to end in death or an <UNK> finale it's like all the european film noir releases in the 40's 50's 60's and 70's the lead male or female must die or ride off alone into oblivion why in god's name must writers directors and producers have the audience leave the theatre feeling depressed after all it's supposed to be gay not <UNK> maybe the category should be changed to a <UNK> film a large <UNK> of gay relationships do last and the couples do ride off together into the sunset no matter who writes or produces he only shows the down side of gay life and gives the incorrect impression of gay lifestyle this movie just proves my point if you rent the dvd take an <UNK> for here comes another <UNK> film this is wrong
<START> more <UNK> and dark secrets released in the final parts of lars von <UNK> fantastic horror satire the kingdom much more is revealed and the ending just leaves you begging for more plus a great performance from <UNK> <UNK> in a more substantial role
<START> i love bad shark movies i really do i laugh hysterically at them and the scifi channel was having a marathon of them culminating in the <UNK> of their new original picture hammerhead shark frenzy based on the previews it looked like it was going to be highly amusing essentially a remake of <UNK> creature really it was <UNK> by a showing of shark attack 3 <UNK> which is shark movie hilarity at its best i was in the mood i was ready to go bring it on hammerhead mad scientist man oh god was that movie wrong br br wrong wrong wrong br br sick twisted messed up br br this is <UNK> <UNK> at its very worst my friends when a drugged out girl is brought out of suspended animation and <UNK> to a table screaming her head off because the shark human hybrid <UNK> the absolutely insane scientist deliberately <UNK> in her <UNK> wants out jesus monkeys that's what i call disturbing br br that's really how the plot works hmmm thought the mad scientist my son died of cancer but i brought him back to life by combining his <UNK> with that of a hammerhead shark because sharks don't <UNK> to cancer and further <UNK> <UNK> via <UNK> oh look a perfect <UNK> being i've created the next evolution of the human race i know let's make him <UNK> but <UNK> if all those shark <UNK> <UNK> made my son <UNK> instead of <UNK> the hot babes i keep sending into his little jungle paradise he keeps eating him but check this out among the random people who have by way of some <UNK> plot twist ended up on my research island is the woman to whom my son was engaged before he died i bet he'll do her all this leads up to an extremely touching and heartfelt reunion woman you're going to <UNK> me mad scientist no he is <UNK> <UNK> shark person in tank how sweet br br do not watch this movie ever
<START> answer despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman your ex is <UNK> <UNK> and more irrational than any zombie that ever <UNK> the earth br br the acting in this independent film actually is quite good despite the less than wonderful script it takes a pretty good actor to deliver an <UNK> clichéd line and make it sound vaguely believable young anthony de <UNK> as jake puts in a particularly good performance br br fortunately the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog try it especially if you're not a monster fan this is not a horror flick even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film <UNK> closet is suitable for mature adults br br the whole this time is much better than the sum of its parts
<START> i really enjoyed watching this movie about the <UNK> sisters i knew of them but that was all this movie opened my eyes to their <UNK> and courage what a pair what sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms this is not only a movie for african americans but for all americans it is sort of a history lesson and a documentary rolled into one and combined with an entertaining movie biography the acting was superior by all included and we really do get a glimpse of the <UNK> these two sisters went through for many years both sisters are quite different from each other they came from a very loving and very strict family with high maybe even impossible standards of perfection it is sad to see how <UNK> father refused to allow his daughter to continue to see her boyfriend due to a possible <UNK> i thoroughly recommend this movie and i am glad i caught it on television the other day
<START> i won't mention any of the plot because although it would be highly predictable anyway the one notable plot twist is given away everywhere in the movie comments in the plot summary here and even in the synopsis on my netflix <UNK> i might have enjoyed it more if i hadn't known that maybe this film has a <UNK> good cast most of whom did <UNK> acting with the rather limited material at hand including donald sutherland <UNK> ann warren and <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in smaller parts it was impossible to like william <UNK> but that was clearly by design and there were a couple of quick nude scenes by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but none of this brings the slightest recommendation from me don't any of these fine actors actually read these scripts before <UNK> on
<START> you gotta love the cheesy low budget movies this one comes complete with bad effects props and bad acting really bad plus every time i see <UNK> <UNK> the sister i keep thinking <UNK> out she's a <UNK> for those that know buffy angel br br a perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick the little that was spent of course i don't know if i feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn't make back any money br br i'd say it's good for little kids in it's simplicity but i don't know if i'd want to subject a kid to it br br <UNK> 1 10 because that's the lowest it will go

<START> a bunch of popular high school students play a cruel joke on nerdy marty a sympathetic performance by simon <UNK> which leaves him <UNK> <UNK> five years later the gang returns to the now <UNK> and abandoned high school for a reunion of course an angry and <UNK> marty shows up dressed in a <UNK> costume to exact a grisly revenge on his <UNK> writers directors mark <UNK> peter <UNK> and george <UNK> <UNK> out all the <UNK> corny clichés which make these 80's <UNK> body count flicks so much cheesy fun fake jump scares <UNK> <UNK> shots a fierce storm an insanely <UNK> hard rock soundtrack a nice <UNK> of gratuitous female nudity a totally ridiculous what the hell supernatural climax tacky make up f x and one of those <UNK> lame it was all just a terrible dream fake out non endings moreover the elaborate murder set pieces deliver the gruesome goods gory highlights include a man's stomach exploding after he drinks <UNK> beer a lady taking an acid bath a guy being crushed under a huge <UNK> and two people getting <UNK> while in the middle of having wild passionate sex <UNK> british cult horror <UNK> caroline <UNK> is hilariously miscast as an american teenager in the first third of the flick the cast all give solid performances with especially stand out work from <UNK> <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> skip <UNK> billy <UNK> as faded macho <UNK> frank and donna <UNK> as foul mouthed slut stella co producer dick randall has an amusing cameo as <UNK> sleazy agent <UNK> harry <UNK> moody <UNK> music shamelessly <UNK> <UNK> from his friday the 13th scores alan <UNK> slick cinematography does the trick good trashy fun
<START> from the beginning of the movie it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something what i mean to say that instead of the story <UNK> the style in which the movie should be made he has gone in the opposite way he had a type of move that he wanted to make and wrote a story to <UNK> it and he has failed in it very badly i guess he was trying to make a stylish movie any way i think this movie is a total waste of time and effort in the credit of the director he knows the media that he is working with what i am trying to say is i have seen worst movies than this here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie and the actors also have given a decent performance
<START> every motion picture bette davis stars in is worth experiencing before davis co stars with leslie howard in of human bondage she'd been in over a score of movies legend has it that davis was <UNK> of a <UNK> oscar for her performance as a cockney speaking waitress <UNK> mother manipulative boyfriend user mildred rogers the story goes that the <UNK> <UNK> davis by <UNK> her 1st oscar for playing <UNK> heath in dangerous i imagine <UNK> fans of of human bondage who agree with the oscar robbing legend are going to have at my <UNK> contrast of the 1934 film for which the <UNK> didn't award her performance the 1936 film dangerous performance for which she received her 1st oscar in <UNK> br br i've tried to view all of bette <UNK> motion pictures tv interviews videos <UNK> for wwii tv performances in popular series in <UNK> it is easy to recognize why this film of human bondage gave davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance she was only <UNK> when the film was completed just about to reach hollywood's red carpet the public began to notice bette davis as a star because of her performance in of human bondage that is what makes it her legendary performance but rko saw her greatness in the man who played god borrowed her from <UNK> to play rogers br br i'm going to go with the <UNK> in <UNK> some <UNK> years after their <UNK> decision to award davis her 1st best actress oscar for dangerous 2 years later by doing so the <UNK> may have been <UNK> in bringing out the very best in one of hollywood's most talented 20th century actors because from of human bondage <UNK> davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep inside of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue <UNK> she deserved more than 2 oscars perhaps as many as 6 br br dangerous provides an <UNK> contrast in <UNK> depth of acting characterization for it's in dangerous 1936 that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century davis is so good as <UNK> heath she's dead center on the red carpet whereas in of human bondage davis is right off the edge still on the sidewalk ready to take off on the rest of her 60 year acting career br br perhaps by not <UNK> her that legendary oscar in <UNK> instead of a star being born an actor was given <UNK> to reach beyond stardom into her soul for the gifted actor's greatest work br br it is well known that her contemporary <UNK> <UNK> was joan crawford a star whose performances still don't measure up to <UNK> even anna nicole smith was a <UNK> howard stern is a radio host <UNK> too lots of people on stage the silver screen are stars few became great actors the key difference between them is something that bette davis could sense the difference between the desire to do great acting or to become star struck br br try comparing these two movies as i have viewing one right after the other maybe you'll recognize what the <UNK> i did davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at <UNK> achieved her goal by the time she was 27 she spent her next 50 plus years setting the bar so high that it has not been reached yet br br had the <UNK> sent her the message that she'd arrived in of human bondage <UNK> life history as a great actor may have been led into star struck dom instead
<START> i saw two movies over the weekend one was <UNK> and the other <UNK> both movies are made in bollywood but they are worlds apart the fundamental difference is the story and the director <UNK> shaw made his <UNK> mark with <UNK> one of the best comedy hindi movies his casting of the <UNK> is perfect the story apparently taken from a <UNK> play is awesome the treatment is superb with some exceptions in bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a bollywood director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy mediocre <UNK> in this instance is <UNK> to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract so even a good director like <UNK> shah has to use them to <UNK> the <UNK> and the <UNK> who just cant get enough of these numbers no music director can <UNK> out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie none of the songs have any melody and they are clearly <UNK> to the narration of the story except the background music and the <UNK> version of the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> and role playing the father and son is good acting by <UNK> and akshay kumar his stunt scenes are clearly outstanding a good director <UNK> himself with good actors and he is willing to wait till a good story comes along as in this super movie then we have a cheap <UNK> tasteless producer like <UNK> khan who will <UNK> low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like <UNK> to <UNK> himself at the cost of the <UNK> of art and they surround themselves with borderline talent and they <UNK> the investment before the word gets around these are the bollywood <UNK> who prey on the <UNK> audience to garner film farce awards given by bollywood <UNK> and most of them are in the media
<START> <UNK> parker and matt stone the creators of the show <UNK> <UNK> return with something entirely different they create a new sport that combines baseball and basketball this sport is known as baseketball it's like basketball except that the rules of baseball are involved and there's another letter e in the title here's how you play you just shoot the ball while these two guys try to distract you from making the shot sounds simple in fact i might try it one day after the game hits the streets it soon becomes a huge success who would've known that 2 immature friends could <UNK> a sport that became so successful br br my opinion br br <UNK> is a very crude and silly spoof filled with lots of slapstick violence yet it actually delivers some laughs and plenty of entertainment a definite recommendation for those of you who like slapstick and rude humor
<START> first this was a brave film i've seen <UNK> and can understand the comparisons however i cannot begin to understand the people who've <UNK> this film i can see how the end may have come off extreme but i'd be lying if i didn't say i wished that every guy who's ever forced a woman into sex deserved exactly what jared got <UNK> it didn't solve anything or make anything better and the fact that the film doesn't pretend to is what made me appreciate it br br the comment prior to this one called the film pathetic and claimed no adult would stick with i certainly did and <UNK> i'm 24 years old the way the film drags made it realistic to me people have become so used to eye candy and fast paced plots on screen that if you ask them to concentrate too long on one brick in the foundation of a film not only do they lose interest they <UNK> whatever has been built and call it rubbish when in <UNK> it's their lack of patience and <UNK> that needs fine <UNK> and not the product of a creative mind such as <UNK> <UNK> br br rosario dawson displayed the <UNK> of self destruction <UNK> i think she portrayed <UNK> pre and post assault with great ease and the transition between the two is an act i rarely ever see done well often times much like the films aimed at teens mentioned in the prior comment the effects of rape are displayed as either extremely manic and <UNK> or terribly depressed isolated and lifeless dawson in my opinion manages to perform the <UNK> act so many survivors fall prey to <UNK> like existence in the waking hours working some dead end job to survive and distract and then <UNK> in <UNK> in order to lose themselves in the <UNK> of substance abuse rather than face what <UNK> brings br br i thought this film told the truth and i appreciated it for finally showing people a different side of rape so many people let the end of this film <UNK> the middle and the beginning i believe that <UNK> face during the act was the end not the act itself not the vengeance or the meaning behind it just her face br br thank you
<START> wow what a terrible adaptation of a beautiful novel here are just a few <UNK> the screenwriter eliminated two major characters from the book plot has been <UNK> altered <UNK> sound as if they were directly lifted from written <UNK> which may read well but are not the same when spoken especially with <UNK> writing style the acting is more wooden than a <UNK> cabin <UNK> <UNK> this is supposed to be set in 1983 feels more like 2003 br br to be fair i couldn't bring myself to finish watching this movie so it's possible that it redeemed itself sarcasm i truly hope that no one paid to see this or at least anyone who read the book hoping for something decent a la wonder boys i like <UNK> as a writer but he should be ashamed of this adaptation br br no stars
<START> there are some movies you just know they are going to be bad from frame one even if you were totally oblivious of ed <UNK> work one look at that <UNK> from plan 9 from outer space and you just know you are not gonna see the next cinematic masterpiece just like that when i saw the first shot of uwe <UNK> masterpiece house of dead with that guy sitting at the front of the house starting his introduction while trying desperately to sound like he just arrived from sin city i knew i'm in for a <UNK> ride br br so the movie starts like this first the lead character says that everybody else is going to die you know to keep you wandering then he starts introducing the rest of the characters with lines like <UNK> thinks she's <UNK> brown or alicia my ex we broke up recently i had to study and she had to fence no i'm not kidding br br anyway this bunch of 20 somethings who couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag are going to the rave of the century rave in question being a few <UNK> a <UNK> a <UNK> and a shoddy stage located on small island in the middle of the pacific our gang missed the ferry but thankfully will find a way to get there the way being a fisher boat ran by kirk <UNK> kirk get it man whoever wrote this script is a genius and his sidekick who is a bastard child of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and that hook killer who knows what you did last summer br br to make the long story short the gang gets to the island finds nobody there except some bloody t shirts and then decide to run the hell away from there no wait they do not they actually get all happy and like <UNK> there's free booze br br with that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill some guys in rubber suits start running around there is some screaming and shooting our gang goes to some house to meet some other gang they go out of the house meet <UNK> kirk and some police woman who between them have about 500 pounds of weapons and then decide to go back to the house somewhere along the line they <UNK> into a s w a t team enter the matrix the rubber suit guys start <UNK> like <UNK> and i start to cry because i actually paid to see this to add insult to the injury every few minutes there are shots from the video game this crap is based on and there is a cute game over cut scene for a few characters when they die br br i seriously hate this movie it doesn't even fit in that famed so bad it's good category it's just plain bad the script is bad the zombies are awful there is no tension lines are bad actors are bad the list just goes on br br you will probably want to see this movie just because of its reputation of being awful don't there are bad movies that deserve to be watched this is not one of them
<START> where do you begin with a movie as bad as this br br do you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes the over the top acting the dreadful script br br no you just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at i know i do i respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from <UNK> like empire usually a bad sign if a preview copy isn't available to the quality movie <UNK> however cinemas really should start thinking about giving out <UNK> if the <UNK> isn't happy with the finished product br br i went three days after it opened with two other mates the only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his own br br and that was on cheap night br br either the ad campaign had failed <UNK> or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this is br br not since the days of the <UNK> 1998 have i felt so short changed since watching a movie if a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching it br br tara fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up or walking off the set keith allen <UNK> some dignity amid the cinematic carnage barry foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance rhys <UNK> does his career no <UNK> after the success of <UNK> hill and only dani <UNK> is halfway likeable as a <UNK> secretary br br mind you considering she used to be in the word any <UNK> expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin with br br the production values aren't bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious if you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say <UNK> for a couple of hours then this should be right up your street br br otherwise <UNK> required br br
<START> i love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one but this film is static never mind the production value which is very noble for its budget but the pacing is deadly admittedly these folks achieve much with little but the film fails on the most fundamental level it's boring the editing is <UNK> and the pacing <UNK> it should have been <UNK> minutes the best thing about the dr <UNK> is mr hyde who isn't seen nearly enough he had the most dramatic potential instead we have to suffer through <UNK> <UNK> brits <UNK> through endless and tiresome exposition it feels like a <UNK> stage play committed to video br br noble efforts by everyone in the production but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice instead it's just a lame <UNK>
<START> i sat through this movie this evening forcing myself to stick with it even though i never cared about any of the characters or what happened to them because the two leads <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> morgan were major film stars of their era and i wanted to see them in something different which this certainly was they both gave fine performances but of <UNK> characters br br indeed the whole movie is about a <UNK> little town in mexico inhabited by almost uniformly <UNK> characters the doctor is of course the major exception what <UNK> morgan ever sees in <UNK> to fall in love with him is never explained br br this is supposedly based on a work by jean paul <UNK> all i could think was that if <UNK> work is anything like this movie it must be a very mediocre attempt at imitating <UNK> masterful novel the plague which dealt with a plague in north africa br br a well acted but uninteresting movie
<START> previous comment made me write this it says that muslims are blonde and <UNK> are dark because our blood is mixed this comment just says that this opinion can be made by racist look race is nothing i'm color blind i look like pierce brosnan but i'm no irish so what i might add that i am not 100 <UNK> that i have some <UNK> and <UNK> blood within me but whats the point i'm dark half breed is that so anyone using racial prejudices with such bad intent like <UNK> <UNK> director is racist for me <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> they are all monsters and i blame them for destroying my life my family my country <UNK> hope they will be all in hell but that wont return our dead relatives back i am proud of being <UNK> and i am proud of my cousins <UNK> <UNK> muslims <UNK> <UNK> yes i am from <UNK> and i have <UNK> family this movie doesn't show <UNK> of <UNK> or <UNK> within <UNK> terrible terrorism of street gangs muslim <UNK> i add i <UNK> and pray for all innocent sisters and brothers muslim catholic or <UNK> killed in this war this film is manipulation with our misery false <UNK> which doesn't help at all it helps <UNK> to fill his <UNK> with more <UNK> alright
<START> you know what they say about the 70's if you can remember them you weren't there one of the few things i do remember about the 70's was the very first hippie and hip social satire as seen from a totally <UNK> counter culture perspective the groove tube if the humor seems faded or witless now to some viewers it can only be because a lot has happened in the last 30 years and the comedy isn't <UNK> anymore but hey when this movie came out it was a first and some of these skits were being done for the very first time at a time when <UNK> was in office the vietnam war was raging the sexual revolution was in full swing and j edgar hoover was still in charge of the fbi this is a film made before <UNK> broke and as such it was one of the first to take a big <UNK> at the establishment to make fun of it and the hippies at the same time and frankly some skits are still dead funny if you liked cheech and <UNK> up in smoke you will love this film br br if you want to know what the 70's were really like check out the groove tube if you liked the oscar winning network from about the same year and thought it was right on the mark in its savage look at tv you will dig the groove tube which picks up on the theme but plays from the angle of the viewers the young viewers who were turning off the tv in favor of other <UNK> we had been raised on <UNK> harriet leave it to <UNK> father knows best my three sons happy days so imagine our glee when those of us who were <UNK> with the new life styles got to see a send up of the box as seen from our perspective the commercials by the <UNK> corporation alone are priceless good things come from <UNK> and the sudden break from straight film into fritz the cat style animation when the hippies eat the <UNK> is still one of the best <UNK> in and out of sanity i have ever seen on film br br if you liked the kentucky fried movie you will love this film and if you ever wondered why your weird uncle harold still gets a wicked <UNK> in his eye when thinking back to his college days this would be the perfect film to watch br br take it for what it is a <UNK> of the times and a sassy little film that will help all of us who did forget the 70's to remember them <UNK>
<START> <UNK> when it came out this film now looks handsome and sounds great a feast of intelligent thoughtful acting from gielgud kenneth <UNK> harry andrews and especially anton <UNK> and a moving central performance from the beautiful and incredibly young jean <UNK> preminger doesn't jump around and show off his long slow takes encourage you to listen and reflect and graham <UNK> script <UNK> shaw without <UNK> complexity the piece has the look of a made for tv movie and is certainly studio bound but none the worse for that too many contemporary movies on <UNK> themes cannot resist <UNK> down what would mel gibson have made of the maid many <UNK> shots of her on the rack probably then <UNK> up on the <UNK> as the flames take hold preminger does none of this the burning is shown mainly through a guilt stricken reaction there are a few weak performances but not enough to cause any serious damage i caught this movie on tv and was not expecting to watch it through but i was <UNK> in our age of religious <UNK> and sacrifice <UNK> story has unexpected <UNK>
<START> i don't know why i'm commenting this stupid reality show i happened to watch a few episodes of a cable marathon broadcast when they aired 5 episodes in a row or something i didn't watch the entire thing though only like three episodes as i was nine months pregnant and about to go into labor any day maybe i'm just bored today br br i feel sorry for britney i really do for all her money and fame she seem to have very little sense of dignity or she's self centered to the extreme she married the <UNK> <UNK> okay anybody can make a mistake and before that she starred this horrible show about her everyday life with him where she <UNK> a camcorder wherever she feels like it no matter if it is in someone's face or into the shower as <UNK> is standing in there she's <UNK> about her sex life without leaving anything to your imagination i don't care for my part but i can't help wondering how she feels about it now when she's divorced and yes for her sake i'm embarrassed but i shouldn't be she seem to live a pretty empty shallow life though i don't want to <UNK> lives with her even if i could road kill tv if you like
<START> this is a great film touching and strong the direction is without question breathless good work to the team i feel so sorry for marlene by the grace of god go you or i
<START> i have no clue as to what this was shot on but you can definitely tell that they had no budget bad acting horrible cinematography and lame plot and some decent special effects do not make a good movie the <UNK> style <UNK> will make you cry where's the <UNK> the <UNK> aimed high but sorely missed their mark
<START> the tragedy is that this piece of rubbish was part of my <UNK> while i was studying cinema so imagine how i was forced to watch it in complete believe me going through hell is much much easier our professor told us that this is some film but he never thought that we'd disagree or assume the <UNK> i don't think that there is any gods on earth we're only humans so all the filmmakers therefore they can make mistakes bad movies or very bad too the main problem wasn't that art by all means is <UNK> to endless points of view but that a lot of people just don't get it that every single human got his own genuine taste his own opinion hence what i suppose it the greatest movie ever made can also be your worst one ever and how that is right both ways but how many people can understand this correctly so my professor believes in this movie and simply i don't however the only way to <UNK> this thing is by <UNK> it by its original intent to show us different kinds of old folk stories or whatever to catch on this <UNK> mentality imagination and nature to tell you the damn truth mr <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the scriptwriter and the director made it too unbearable to watch in the first place the movie is so ugly i can't stand this so how about <UNK> it then discovering the potential beauty in it it's beyond your mind <UNK> and strangely not for the sake of the movie's case or anything it's for the sake of the unstable vision of <UNK> his work is so primitive to underdeveloped extent the deadly cinematic technique the effective sense of silliness and the incredible <UNK> made everything obnoxious look at the atrocious acting the <UNK> cinematography the awfully poor sets oh my god i've got the <UNK> already it can <UNK> your <UNK> violently as watching this movie is one true pain like taking the wisdom tooth off by a blind doctor there are dreadful nightmares which could be more <UNK> than this so originally how to continue that just to review it fairly actually you don't as this very movie doesn't treat you fair at all there is really memorable scene in here where some boys are <UNK> into the eye of the camera i'm trying to connect some things like that with <UNK> end as murdered
<START> i just saw this at the 2006 <UNK> international film festival the synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good so we decided to check this one out i'm sorry to say i was very disappointed br br besides being poorly written it was boring i won't take away from the actors as there is not much they could do with this bad script br br first bite was cliché without being ironic over the top seriousness without being funny the movie would have been better had hunt <UNK> went with a campy horror feel instead he took himself to seriously and this resulted with a boring film i can't recommend this film it felt too long and all in all just plain weak
<START> gerard is a writer with a somewhat <UNK> imagination he is also homosexual and catholic prone to catholic guilt and something of a <UNK> or so it seems on a trip to <UNK> he is <UNK> by christine when he discovers that <UNK> new boyfriend is the bit of rough trade he's been <UNK> from <UNK> he decides to stick around after all <UNK> <UNK> has its <UNK> then he realizes that <UNK> previous three husbands have all died violent deaths did christine murder them and is he or the boyfriend herman going to be 'the fourth man' verhoeven's <UNK> over <UNK> melodrama is a delicious blend of hitchcock and david lynch full of <UNK> <UNK> and religious imagery and an awful lot of the colour red a lot of the time it looks and feels like a dream and we can never be sure that what we are seeing is real or a <UNK> of <UNK> imagination the fun is in <UNK> it out also the fact that christine is an infinitely more likable character that either the <UNK> gerard or the <UNK> herman means we are hardly like to root for either of the men over her in fact it's fair to say <UNK> <UNK> can't come soon enough super performances too from <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> and easily verhoeven's best film up to his wonderfully <UNK> piece of sci fi starship troopers
<START> i had to watch this in school and to sum it up br br talentless actors talentless script and a talentless director br br this movie is such a waste of your time don't even watch the movie don't bother you will be so disappointed my teacher said it was supposed to be good how wrong she was she even slept through it a little the movie's actors were just bad the best actor in there was the old man and that's not saying much it's has horrible plot with awful characters so unrealistic and i can honestly said it had no point the script was <UNK> and confusing there was points in the movie when i <UNK> my <UNK> and said what also there were just too many loose ties and plot holes it was just absolutely horrendous
<START> this is the worst show i have seen in years i believe that it should be taken off of t v because of its <UNK> it is so dumb i could faint when i watch it even though i never watch it because it is <UNK> poor br br goofs when mac says he can t eat sugar in another episode he eats sugar almost everything in the world has sugar in it in episode eddie monster when eddy screams at <UNK> he falls into the <UNK> twice plus the <UNK> time he falls in he doesn't fall in he falls off to the side what stupidity i can't even say the word <UNK> home i even made a song with my band about how retarded this show is <UNK>
<START> i liked this movie although halfway through it i was able to tell who the secret admirer was br br i am also wondering if it was based on a true story since it told about the real people at the end of the movie i guess i will have to research it and let ya know br br does anyone remember what state this happened in i believe they moved to north <UNK> if i'm not mistaken br br of course the states could have been changed to protect the innocent br br you would think that this man could have figured it out as easily as i did was he stupid or what
<START> and that comes from someone that will <UNK> almost any viewing the acting and sound is awful this might qualify for a so bad it's good point of merit for some however i take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap it's just <UNK> cheap i think that's my major complaint the dialogue is often hilarious attention to how many times you <UNK> me is used the child actress is seriously god awful i pray her acting career ended here her line <UNK> i hate <UNK> is worth repeated viewing however
<START> this film is a good example of how through media manipulation you can sell a film that is no more than a very unfunny tv sitcom in puerto rico the daily newspaper with the <UNK> <UNK> has continuously written about the <UNK> of this film almost <UNK> all others <UNK> the newspaper with the second largest <UNK> belongs to the same owners the weekly <UNK> is the only newspaper on the island that has <UNK> the film's form and content and pointed out all its flaws clichés and bad writing br br just because a film makes a portion of the audience laugh with easy and obvious jokes and because one can recognize actors and scenery does not make it an acceptable film
<START> my grandmother took me and my sister out to see this movie when it came out in theaters back in 1998 and so we happily bought the tickets the popcorn and <UNK> and walked right in to the theater and sat down to watch the movie when it was over the audience didn't <UNK> strongly i remember that i heard a few people say that they didn't like it at all i didn't like it i thought that it was rather stupid and not worth seeing eddie murphy was hysterical in this but apart from him the whole movie was bad i rarely laughed at the parts in this i also remembered that the other people in the theater almost hardly even laughed and what i really thought was bad was making the animals talk because talking animals only exist in cartoons in live action movies they are totally a <UNK> i said that apart from eddie murphy's hysterical twist he brings in this movie is not worth watching it is rather stupid br br i have seen eddie murphy in several of movies and i thought that he was funny in those i have just said that he was the only funny part of this movie i also have not seen eddie murphy in the really great movie the adventures of <UNK> <UNK> this movie is not a movie that i would really recommend that you see because apart from eddie murphy you probably are not going to like this especially because of a lot the the talking animals in it br br i'll give this movie a rating of 3 stars out of a possible 10 stars
<START> this movie was poorly written poorly acted and very predictable it was very low budget and i can understand why it was never released and went straight to video it wasn't even campy fun it was just a complete disaster and i wish i could get the 1 1 2 hours back the colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them br br the plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing what a stretch skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this br br <UNK>
<START> i greatly enjoyed margaret <UNK> novel 'the <UNK> <UNK> and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder and his buddy an ex cop journalist tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman's crazy female friends it's fortunate that the movie script <UNK> ms <UNK> clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men victims of scheming women br br <UNK> okay you got me if these guys are mentioned in the book and i'm pretty sure they're entirely made up for the movie i'll eat the dust cover of my <UNK> copy apparently the three main female characters of the novel aren't enough to carry the movie <UNK> <UNK> aren't interesting unless we see them happen to a man and a man's life is screwed up <UNK> <UNK> and toni tell their stories to a man because it's not important if a man doesn't hear them br br i liked the characters in the book it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man's story i normally do not look for feminist angles on media and i tried to enjoy the movie as is if i hadn't read the book i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more so if you like the cop and the ex cop and you want to read more about them you're out of luck read the novel if you want to enjoy <UNK> <UNK> and characterization subtly layered through a plot it's the same plot the movie <UNK> it <UNK> it and <UNK> it with male angst it's like <UNK> revenge on margaret <UNK>
<START> i can't understand why so many peoples praised this show twin peaks is one of the most boring titles i have ever seen in my life br br now i have seen all season 1 episodes and seeing season 2 episode 1 simply i can't take this show anymore br br 1 where is the proper <UNK> in criminal investigation br br in season 1 there was a scene that agent cooper throws stones to a bottle can you guess why he did that he just want to identify murderer by doing this <UNK> while mentioning supernatural ability given by <UNK> dream wow br br 2 there are too many unnecessary scenes in this show br br for example season 2 started with a <UNK> scene that a dumb old man serves agent cooper with a cup of milk while cooper are laying down on the floor he got the gun shoots in his belly already this old man is doing nothing but saying some dumb comments that's all br br this scene is really boring and even long 3 min 30 <UNK> it's like hell br br i would read some comic books rather than see this show anymore
<START> this film uses all art house clichés slow pace long static shots minimal amount of dialog to try to hide the fact that there really is nothing worth watching here there is no plot to speak of the characters are dreary female lead or cliché <UNK> character and they do not ever talk to each other about anything that concerns their rather <UNK> lives the film is centered around a woman who finds out about her husbands adultery instead of confronting him she half <UNK> takes revenge by committing adultery herself after a fight and a <UNK> with her sister who knew about the adultery without telling her she asks her husband to stop cheating on her they seem to be re united as a family two other story lines the planned move of the woman's elderly father with his young wife to <UNK> and the rivalry with the woman's sister do not offer any interesting developments the suicide of a colleague of the woman that seems to set off events in the film is not a subject in itself for 2005 or any other year for that matter this is not enough to make an interesting film br br moreover what little possibilities for dramatic development there are in the script are not used or are <UNK> avoided as when both the woman and her sister mark a particular piece of furniture from their fathers house which is going to be sold because of his planned move both sisters want this particular piece and given their rivalry in the past over much more important things than furniture men this could in theory lead to a confrontation or the matter could be resolved by one sister giving way to the other either way this would not be a very interesting or original development of the story but at least it would <UNK> some development the film clearly sets this situation up with both sisters looking <UNK> at each other during the <UNK> and one sister having mentioned she does not want to draw <UNK> but it <UNK> us out of any resolution the scene simply ends and how this in itself rather dreary and <UNK> issue is solved is not shown br br although almost completely absent the dialog that is in the film is excruciatingly flat and tepid for example when during a visit to <UNK> the 2 sisters address their rivalry it is in a three line dialog that has a childish yes it is no it isn't ring to it the fight and <UNK> scene with the 2 sisters is completely without dialog giving a highly artificial overly <UNK> and unrealistic impression and considerably <UNK> its impact the way the woman finally finally <UNK> her husbands adultery in a single line of dialog has to be seen to be believed and is at the same time completely unbelievable the husband does not seem to have any noticeable reaction or if he has any it is not shown the woman does not mention her own adultery to her husband the scene showing the woman husband and their young son asleep on an <UNK> watched by the sister is possibly meant as a happy end but the way the characters addressed the issues of their lives in what went before makes this unlikely br br because of its slow pace uninteresting story <UNK> direction and absurd lack of dialog i found this film an example of everything that can be wrong with an art house movie and a complete waste of time
<START> if it wasn't for the performances of barry diamond and art evans as the clueless <UNK> i would have no reason to recommend this to anyone br br the plot centers around a 10 year high school reunion which takes place in a supposed abandon high school looks more like a prop from a 1950s low budget horror flick and the deranged student the class pulled a very <UNK> prank on this student desires to kill off the entire class for revenge br br john hughes falls in love with his characters too much as only one student is killed as well as the lunch lady <UNK> anne <UNK> we're led to believe that the horny coupled gets killed but never see a <UNK> thing this is a horrible movie that continued national <UNK> <UNK> spiral throughout the 80s and 90s
<START> ok if you're a woman who's got <UNK> issues you might like this movie hate your significant other this movie is for you for the guys it will be a bag of laughs br br it's sad when former award winning actresses have to do cut rate movies br br the only really good part is the last 10 seconds even that was a load of cheese br br my wife is picking the worst movies lately this is what you get i for letting my wife pick movies based on reading reviews on movie rental sites
<START> i know i know it's childish but i just love this type of movie a bird that suffered a lot of <UNK> and still hasn't lost his faith in humanity and his sense of humor what's special about this film is the fact that the main character is paulie the parrot and he's not used as a boost to some <UNK> human actor furthermore i like the storyline paulie tells his <UNK> to a <UNK> at the point he hit rock bottom by the way jay <UNK> voice almost sounds like joe <UNK> and cheech <UNK> of course the man is humor to me ever since i saw up in smoke i have appreciated his naive way of performing making a simple situation a hilarious one can't help myself
<START> <UNK> nice guy falls for a <UNK> blonde she likes him too but not for the reasons you might think little seen black comedy from writer pat <UNK> features very good performances by joe <UNK> and donna dixon yet it makes no lasting impact it's just a <UNK> throwaway effort <UNK> by norman bates himself anthony <UNK> even on the level of b comedies the somewhat similar eating <UNK> is a better bet there's definitely an amusing set up here unfortunately the picture has nowhere to go in its second act an interesting try but it <UNK> br br from
<START> it's rare that i come across a film this awful this annoying and this irritating it is without doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen br br the plot when it's not a <UNK> of confusing and <UNK> over flashy editing is ludicrous why did domino become such a bad ass tough bitch because her gold fish died when she was a kid and this traumatic event left her emotionally <UNK> and hating everyone when the dialogue is not clichéd or banal it's <UNK> with laughable lines such as there are three kinds of people in this world the rich the poor and everyone else at one point the bounty hunters have some guy tied up in the back of their bus who has a combination number <UNK> on his arm because of a confusing mobile phone call instead of rolling his <UNK> up and just reading the number they blow off his arm with a shotgun at another point the bounty hunters take a bomb to a meeting arranged with the mafia and <UNK> to set the bomb off unless the mafia let them go clearly not going to the meeting would have been just too easy br br <UNK> knightley is unconvincing and dreadfully miscast mickey rourke does manage to salvage some credibility from this mess br br i have enjoyed some of tony scott's previous films true romance being one but all i could think while suffering this drivel was that it must have been made by a complete idiot
<START> average and surprisingly tame fulci giallo which means it's still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid build up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and <UNK> br br the <UNK> well known weaknesses are in full gear banal dialogue wooden acting illogical plot points and the finale goes on much too long while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say limp affair br br <UNK> ironic handling of giallo <UNK> is amusing though yellow clues wherever you look br br 3 out of 10 <UNK> killers
<START> i thought this was a sequel of some sorts and it is meant to be to the original from 1983 but a sequel is not taking the original plot and destroying it br br i actually had very little expectations to this movie but i just wasted 95 minutes of life no suspense i actually feel <UNK> poor acting and so filled with technical errors so i as a computer geek just couldn't believe it they have tried to make it a mix between a generic war movie and 24 hours but this is not even worthy of a low budget tv movie br br do not see this movie this is a complete waste of time instead get the original the theme is still valid don't let to much power into a machine and the acting and plot is far more <UNK> and compelling
<START> i enjoyed <UNK> which followed in the steps of raymond <UNK> successful <UNK> tv series and was intended to give it competition but this show was canceled after one season because it was decided i believe wrongly that <UNK> was not able to compete with mr <UNK> <UNK> br br i may add that the pilot for this show was especially well done and very memorable i hope that a box set of <UNK> will appear br br writers should note that this story idea was only briefly explored here and that much more could and should be done to show the play and interplay of <UNK> on tv
<START> this very good movie <UNK> with tension the stakes are of course high will the police and widmark the public health doctor <UNK> the criminals who don't know that they are carrying plague before a full scale <UNK> breaks out but smaller plot elements introduce tension in every scene between widmark and the police captain between the bad guys played by palance and mostel between palance and a dying plague stricken man whom palance <UNK> believes is the subject of a <UNK> because he has <UNK> in some valuable <UNK> between widmark and his wife and with the underlying question of whether the public is better served by <UNK> them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full scale panic the movie is beautifully shot by kazan in extraordinarily well choreographed long takes shot on location in new orleans and ends in a stunning climax where palance <UNK> like a rat from his <UNK> through the <UNK> and <UNK> of the city the commentary is superb probably the best that i've heard covering the cinematography the framing and lighting of shots the production design the casting of non professional actors in small roles and the <UNK> and <UNK> in the plot like an insightful <UNK> on 1950s film techniques and film noir generally watch it once to enjoy the film on its own and if you are interested in film making a second time with the commentary on to learn
<START> this movie is most possibly the worst movie i have ever see in my entire life the plot is ridiculous and the whole little man crap is just so stupid the entire movie is unrealistic and dumb let's face it it's just a black comedy this is just a pointless horrible piece that should have never made it to theaters the jokes are not funny and the acting is horrendous please i beg of to you save your money than see this worthless piece of crap i had to endure sitting through little man for an hour and a half wishing my eyes would bleed i am disgusted that something like this would even be thought of who writes this crap the actors have no talent what so ever how do these people get into hollywood they are making money off this junk
<START> walter matthau and george burns just work so well together the <UNK> of willy with the <UNK> <UNK> al is a mixture made in heaven the scene when they meet again in <UNK> flat is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection walter matthau gives a superb performance as the <UNK> semi retired comedian as only he can the <UNK> in the voice and the exaggerated <UNK> coupled with his general <UNK> of what is going on form a great characterization george burns timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film his calm <UNK> with desert dry replies are memorable watch for the scene near the end when al and his daughter ask something of the spanish caretaker and <UNK> reaction priceless
<START> i rented this movie when it came out on video tape and really enjoyed it i had the opportunity to purchase it on dvd a few weeks ago and have watched it several times since i would have to agree with others when they said indian summer was nostalgic film when i watch it i wish that i could be 10 14 again i think that is why we all like the movie to some extent we all at times wish that we could <UNK> our lives as children with the wisdom knowledge of adults wouldn't it be nice to have all your friends parents be young again to not have to worry about your job being a parent etc i know that i would like to jump into a de <UNK> and go back in time while i enjoyed the film very much my all time favorite camp film though is <UNK> with bill murray i wish that they could make an indian summer version of that
<START> larry <UNK> has been <UNK> by most of the comments on this forum well the worst mistake evidently is the marketing of the movie and the way the dvd might have been targeted obviously this is not a true horror movie at least not for people expecting anything that will be gory and instantly satisfying br br wendigo is basically a film that seems to be told from the mind of the young miles things that are not readily understood by children tend to stay in their young minds and ultimately dominate their fears and the menacing world they can't comprehend it is obvious that kim the mother is a psychologist but she has no clue to what is going on in the mind of her son this is also a story of alienation it's clear that the father george is a distant figure perhaps a <UNK> who seems to be living in a different world br br <UNK> fears reach a point of crisis during the week end in the country that part of new york state with its winter landscape <UNK> trees play havoc on the little boy's imagination it doesn't help that he encounters a strange figure in town it creates even more doubts in his young mind ultimately <UNK> world comes crashing down on him and he can't do anything even <UNK> the wendigo spirit br br the film is well paced and acted patricia <UNK> is excellent no matter where movie she is in jake <UNK> is perfect as the distant father who has an opportunity to come closer to a son he doesn't understand <UNK> per sullivan as miles conveys the inner turmoil within him i thought he was extremely effective since the whole movie is miles own take on what's going on around him finally john <UNK> is perfect as the menacing <UNK> a man who <UNK> the world for the way he has turned out br br instead of putting this movie down future viewers should approach it with a open mind
<START> so this is what actress kim basinger has <UNK> to <UNK> to tell the truth the film's title is something quite eye grabbing to getting your interest and plot outline reads so basic but simplicity can have its strengths anyhow by the end of <UNK> she was <UNK> i was left feeling rather indifferent not the worse despite being <UNK> by <UNK> but there's easily way better in what is an <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> and <UNK> late night survival fable of a feeble suburban housewife stranded in the woods trying to fight for her life after she witnessed the death of a rent a cop that came to her aid when she <UNK> an ugly exchange with some <UNK> in a shopping car park br br the problem here falls on the <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> material taken from a short story along with the very <UNK> performances the flimsy script was poorly thought out which isn't so good when your plot has a slight structure to hang off so many wretched <UNK> and dubious actions just go on to find its way in this endless chain of events as for the bunch of stereotypical <UNK> led by an unconvincing lukas <UNK> as a loose <UNK> <UNK> basinger well they were less than threatening but hopelessly clueless watching basinger <UNK> around in the <UNK> wilderness with a red tool box in her hand don't ask me why knocking off these wannabe <UNK> one by one became ridiculous because it didn't <UNK> tension or <UNK> but instead clumsy <UNK> that were <UNK> <UNK> because of the stupidity of the lead up <UNK> performance is <UNK> like but doesn't craft much empathy craig <UNK> shows up as her hot headed husband strangely i couldn't keep my eyes off the <UNK> thinking to myself that red <UNK> is hypnotic why would she be constantly carrying it and what tool was she going to use to <UNK> the next <UNK> her choices were quite disappointing watching her transformation through the traumatic situation when things are finally turned around is rather empty due to its unsure tone and the ending is something you could see miles ahead br br susan <UNK> <UNK> slick direction lacks <UNK> and energy as it pretty much <UNK> along i liked the opening credits though with its <UNK> <UNK> score which is the most effective thing throughout the feature and polished photography br br no great shakes doesn't ask much of your time but i wouldn't care to see it again however with the inclusion of a joy division song it made me grab a couple of their albums for a listen
<START> warning possible spoilers below br br the film is more boring then anything else there seems to be some attempt to build tension through badly lit shots of empty rooms and empty <UNK> but none of it works br br mst3k did a fairly good job with it but on its own the movie is mostly tedious br br funny moments br br when the fake skull rolls out of a pile of <UNK> the wife becomes hysterical and <UNK> while the husband who is trying to drive the wife crazy says in a deadpan voice there is no skull there there's no skull br br when the real ghost <UNK> have the husband caught in a <UNK> as if trapped between first and second base
<START> the opening credits make for a brilliant atmospheric piece of <UNK> entertainment that's full of little <UNK> to the comic strip all the good guys are good all the bad guys are bad and the film is jam packed with familiar character actors covered in <UNK> make up to hi <UNK> their characteristics br br warren beatty as dick tracy is the ultimate tough guy straight man <UNK> calm usually always a better fighter than the other guy and rarely one to push the limit on <UNK> al pacino as big boy <UNK> steals every scene he's in as a <UNK> backed gangster in some <UNK> metropolis of 1930s gangsters <UNK> plays the kind of person she'd probably play best breathless <UNK> a nightclub singer and femme fatale with her own little agenda going <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> tough talking <UNK> independent long time <UNK> and then there's the kid a funny little street <UNK> tracy takes in who models himself after his surrogate father and saves tracy when the detective has accepted his fate of being blown up br br the supporting players are a who's who of character actors charles <UNK> is the chief of police dick van dyke is the district attorney who's <UNK> by big boy's <UNK> to keep him on the streets dustin hoffman has a humorous turn as <UNK> the <UNK> whose <UNK> is so <UNK> the cops can't make head nor tail of what he has to say r g armstrong is <UNK> one of the rival gangsters big boy forms a special <UNK> to in order to create a network of crime <UNK> throughout the whole city mandy <UNK> is <UNK> keys the piano player for <UNK> show paul sorvino plays lips <UNK> <UNK> former <UNK> until big boy gives him the bath james <UNK> wears relatively little make up in his performance as the only gangster who won't go along with big boy's grand plan william forsythe and ed <UNK> are big boy's <UNK> <UNK> and itchy br br this movie <UNK> all of the corn of the comic strip plus it is full of vibrant colors almost all the suits are elaborate in blues and <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> all the colors of the <UNK> are found in this movie and then some the <UNK> paintings that are used truly realize this world as two dimensional only acted in three dimensional sets the humor is <UNK> al pacino fills the shoes of his character like no other character he's played before or since big boy is kind of crazy and kind of self <UNK> he's an eccentric little man who takes pride in <UNK> our <UNK> fathers and <UNK> himself to great political leaders the man with the plan always looking for the <UNK> way to do business
<START> sharp well made documentary focusing on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i have always liked this approach to film making communicate ideas about a larger more complex and often <UNK> phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to home br br i am sure most people have heard stories about <UNK> and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism and <UNK> effect on <UNK> nations however people feel about it rather than <UNK> on these subjects and get up on a <UNK> not that there's anything wrong with that other than such documentaries typically <UNK> to the converted this documentary simply shows <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> how they are <UNK> by what people and under what conditions and then how they are <UNK> by <UNK> at the end of the process it openly and <UNK> <UNK> the motivations of everyone involved in the process including workers factory management american <UNK> and finally the <UNK> at the end of the chain br br i felt a little <UNK> by this equally by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but also by the way the workers in china have accepted their situation as normal and par for the course even if they have some <UNK> to the details of how they are managed the footage of the street <UNK> cleaning up the <UNK> off the streets at the end made a particular impression but that was just my reaction i can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differently br br unlike other documentaries on this subject i don't think you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this this is ultimately a story about human beings and our relation to the goods we produce and <UNK> if you have ever bought a product made in the far east this should give you something to think about br br outstanding and highly recommended need to see more documentaries like this kudos to all of those involved in the making of this film
<START> you do realize that you've been watching the exact same show for eight years right i could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co exist on an island but you'd think that after watching <UNK> stink <UNK> heroes run <UNK> through the bush with an egg on a <UNK> for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting br br and i'm not even speaking of the shows <UNK> which for the record i find questionable it's just hard to suspend disbelief for <UNK> bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are <UNK> in an air <UNK> make shift bio <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> br br what's the appeal here i don't care about these people or their meandering lives i just don't get it but if you do find yourself being captivated by hairy <UNK> people i suggest you turn off your tv and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their true <UNK> they call them homeless people and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette <UNK> from a <UNK> of garbage <UNK> eventually striking pay dirt and <UNK> a <UNK> dr frankenstein <UNK> cancer stick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of <UNK> <UNK> on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise and the best part much like survivor every week one member of the tribe leaves the island when they are <UNK> sent <UNK> to the local institution when the frightening <UNK> state of full blown <UNK> kicks into gear now that's entertainment
<START> nightmare weekend stars a cast of ridiculous actors with even less of an idea of what is going on than the director had if you can imagine that there is no <UNK> plot or story the special effects are a joke and even the sound is terrible this film was directed by henry <UNK> it was the only film that he ever directed and the reason is obvious
<START> i must admit the only reason i bought this movie was because i am a big fan of gackt and a huge fan of hyde i was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were shall we say pleasing to the feminine eye but a slightly cheesy story i mean the synopsis sounded really out there and now that i have just finished watching it i feel the need to tell the world of its brilliance hyde and gackt both gave heart wrenching performances and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie you get sucked into the story and you really feel for the characters by the end the element of <UNK> which i love but is very easy to <UNK> or to ruin a movie with is subtly mixed into the storyline as to make it something merely exotic normal to this setting rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story i <UNK> it at a 9 out of 10 at first and then i went back and tried to think of why i wasn't giving it that last point came up with nothing so a ten out of ten it is after all i'm not much of a critic the fact that i'm bothering to write a review at all means i either really hate the movie or really love it you can tell what side i'm on with moon child
<START> on a distant planet a psychopath is saved from execution by a space monk he releases a few fellow inmates and breaks out of the prison in a spaceship they <UNK> onto a <UNK> enormous <UNK> that is <UNK> a <UNK> star this massive craft is populated by only three people presumably because the budget of the film did not <UNK> to hiring many actors anyway to cut a long story short the three <UNK> end up in a game of cat and mouse with the baddies br br the psychopath in this movie is curious in that he is annoying <UNK> is generally not a term one would use to describe a lunatic unhinged frightening dangerous maybe but not <UNK> but he is the three people <UNK> the giant ship are seriously unconvincing as <UNK> such important roles this ship is practically the size of a city considering that the film is set approximately 50 years in the future it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge man made craft could exist never mind the fact that it is used for such a relatively mundane task despite the vast size of the spaceship the crew all have <UNK> <UNK> out tiny rooms and the <UNK> room consists of what appears to be a plastic table and <UNK> but there are a lot of corridors br br the film is fairly well acted and it works as an <UNK> sci fi thriller but nothing great
<START> the movie is okay it has it's moments the music scenes are the best of all the soundtrack is a true classic it's a perfect album it starts out with let's go crazy appropriate for the beginning as it's a great party song and very up <UNK> take me with u a fun pop song the beautiful ones a cheerful <UNK> probably the closest thing to r b on this whole album computer blue a somewhat angry <UNK> towards <UNK> darling <UNK> one of the funniest songs ever it very vaguely makes fun of <UNK> when <UNK> cry the climax to this masterpiece i would die 4 u baby i'm a star and of course purple rain a true classic a very appropriate ending for this classic album the movie and the album are both very good i highly recommend them
<START> all i hear about is how poorly the animation is done it may not be up to par with what everyone expects but look at it this way would you expect perfection in hell it is my belief that the animation was made dry and gritty on purpose it was great to see her character transformation in this movie considering it will probably be as close to live action as we will ever get i hope for a sequel very soon if we want live action i think we may be better off with <UNK> or <UNK> i don't think lady death would transfer well to film but be that as it may it is my own personal belief that all the <UNK> about this movie are dead wrong no pun intended
<START> <UNK> to lose friends and alienate <UNK> is an entertaining if loose adaptation of toby <UNK> <UNK> of the same name it's also a great title for helping to fill up the line <UNK> in imdb reviews the basic <UNK> is the same as the book with certain incidents <UNK> but a romantic plot is added and the ending is certainly <UNK> simon pegg despite playing an essentially irritating person is his usual likable and funny self and pretty much carries the film strange to think only a few years ago he was just a tv sitcom guy and now he's <UNK> shoulders with hollywood names there's a good supporting cast and it's an amusing easy watch kind of a male <UNK> <UNK> but funnier
<START> i remember being forced yes literally forced to see this film by a southern <UNK> preacher when i was a kid and even then i loved its awfulness it's designed to scare poor <UNK> into being saved the only thing that saved me was the fact that it finally ended and i could go out and have a real life br br check out the chapter on this film in sarah <UNK> book the politics of the christian right fascinating and certainly more interesting than the movie
<START> i am quite sure that this was the worst movie ever made if you can't make a 13 year old boy laugh at silly humor you should give up comedy forever unfortunately joan rivers chose differently the movie is full of predictable gags some of these are racist and very unfunny jokes particularly memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the lead character that the rabbit has died and he is pregnant as i write this i cannot believe this was actually a movie scene the man rushes to a dead rabbit on the doctors desk and tries to give it mouth to mouth <UNK> not the punch line that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is i knew i should have been on top ha ha ha ha ah ugh
<START> as anyone old enough knows south africa long suffered under the vile racist <UNK> of apartheid which completely <UNK> the black population one of the most famous anti apartheid <UNK> was steve biko who was murdered in jail following the murder reporter donald woods sought to get <UNK> message out to the world br br in cry freedom woods kevin kline befriends biko denzel washington before the latter is arrested on <UNK> up charges when woods attempts to spread <UNK> word he and his family begin living under threat of attack and they are finally forced to flee the country the last scene gut <UNK> shows police firing on <UNK> br br as one of two movies along with a world apart that helped <UNK> the anti apartheid movement cry freedom stands out as possibly the best ever work for all involved
<START> i read in the papers that w snipes was broke so no wonder he would take parts in low budget projects like the <UNK> he is just the next action star to join a growing club the <UNK> action stars of the 90s van damme segal lundgren snipes here he stars the lead in a cheap action flick which was shot in <UNK> we are supposed to believe that the location is london like only a complete moron would buy that the story is the one of 1000 other movies retired special forces good guy gets hired by the government again to do a wet job after that government wants to get rid of him good guy gets away after killing bad guys was that a spoiler guess not the star of the movie the little girl <UNK> bennett <UNK> everybody else of the cast one star is for her plus one star for eye candy lena <UNK> makes 2 stars only for die hard snipes fans everybody else avoid
<START> someone must have been seriously joking when they made this film br br firstly it is an absolute <UNK> that this movie was made in 1993 the fashions and music <UNK> that this is seriously 80's my guess is that this has sat on the shelf for a long while before some crazed <UNK> picked it up and released it to a <UNK> world br br there is a plot kind of a strange loner meets a random man with a beard who tells him that if he <UNK> while singing his favourite song he will be able to turn into <UNK> he chooses at this point i feel <UNK> to point out that the <UNK> favourite song is london bridge is falling down why is this his favourite song because he's an idiot we are only a minute into the film and already the film has reached a monumental level of stupidity it gets even <UNK> br br the loner is the <UNK> <UNK> i can only assume this as there are two scenes in the film where he is seen picking his nose that <UNK> up the title he decides to change into a girl so that he can get close to other girls and kill them that's more or less it br br the acting is universally appalling every single performance in this movie sucks in fact i would go so far as to say that the acting is of the standard of a pornographic movie it really is that terrible the <UNK> <UNK> appears to the audience as the <UNK> <UNK> the characters in the movie see him as the girl he has become through singing london bridge is falling down man i feel like an idiot even <UNK> this anyway it is kind of strange seeing a middle aged weirdo hanging out with school girls and not in a good way there is even an extended montage of scenes where the <UNK> <UNK> is at school with the girls and a song plays over the top it is very possibly the worst song ever recorded i'm not even going to describe it you'll know it when you hear it and you'll agree with me br br there are some scenes of violence sure and there is a benny hill style chase sequence involving a <UNK> there is even an immortal bit of dialogue that may or may not have been taken from shakespeare or john <UNK> where the <UNK> <UNK> says to a prostitute <UNK> got the cash if you've got the <UNK> lovely i'm sure you'll agree br br utter nonsense
<START> its no surprise that busey later developed a <UNK> in his <UNK> <UNK> this film is also a poor decision but one i enjoyed fully the first 5 minutes is the most uninspiring 5 minutes in any film boring bad <UNK> and then with a <UNK> stance busey yells the best worst line in any film ever created your worst nightmare <UNK> i <UNK> up some of my egg <UNK> laughing so hard that line <UNK> so well it even tops <UNK> infamous hi freeze i'm batman line other classic moments is busey constantly getting upset for people reminding him that he got his ex cia partner killed which he did by accidentally shooting him in the chest all made possible by a super slow motion flashback sequence that makes watching paint dry seem exciting there's an <UNK> to the <UNK> punches to the face and a that wasn't my fault and you know it well the footage shows him missing the bad guy and hitting his buddy so other scream out loud moments has to be his ex girl friend dropping a <UNK> to the ground to <UNK> his escape a plan that defies all logic physics and absurdity and lastly when <UNK> jumps out of the <UNK> during intense <UNK> <UNK> and starts to run and <UNK> a small object i almost wet myself some of <UNK> best work by far rent or buy it today <UNK> my vote is a perfect 10 on the poo <UNK> that is
<START> i was not expecting much from this movie i was given a ticket for an advanced screening i had just gotten off of work it was hot and i was tired i had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the <UNK> of the theater complex br br once <UNK> in the theater tired and frustrated the movie started i did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning but the flow of the movie was perfect right from the beginning i became consumed with the movie getting more and more excited with each minute passing i think this movie is destined to be a fantasy fairytale classic the actors were fabulous the pace was perfect and the ending was magical
<START> i'm stunt i must admit i never saw a movie with such good story and none stop high special effect martial art fighting scene if you like the fantastic genre like me you will certainly be more than satisfied all character have very cool power and the special effect are near perfection in one word flawless i will listen to this movie a lot in the next years
<START> after a big tip of the hat to spinal tap this movie is hilarious anyone who grew up watching mtv will love it and if you didn't rent it anyway the my <UNK> and a <UNK> life videos are worth the three bucks alone
<START> this film was a major letdown the level of relentless cruelty and violence in this film was very disturbing some scenes were truly unnecessarily ugly and mean spirited the main characters were impossible to identify with or even sympathize with the lead <UNK> character was as slimy as they come the <UNK> <UNK> atmosphere <UNK> itself to over the top <UNK> little or nothing could be learned about the spanish civil war from this film fortunately i've been to spain and realize this is not realistic in addition the use of same sex attraction as a lurid horror was also very offensive and poorly handled while the dvd is being <UNK> and advertised to attract gay viewers the actors seemed uncomfortable in their roles as if they were trying to distance themselves from this mess i guess if you like watching children and pets being brutally killed this film might especially appeal to you
<START> this had all the <UNK> of a very good film good actors robert <UNK> ellen parker a good plot mysterious missile from space threatens to burn up the planet and lots of stock footage if the air force had film of <UNK> firing rockets it was used unfortunately it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible time line br br the movie concerns a missile from space that is attacked by the <UNK> and inadvertently <UNK> into a low atmospheric <UNK> at under five miles and at a speed in excess of 4 000 miles it <UNK> an <UNK> of a million degrees burning up everything on the ground including <UNK> distant early warning <UNK> line <UNK> and <UNK> br br every attempt at destroying the missile fails br br the first flaws in this film appear early on while we don't expect much from low budget films some things can't be forgotten like a little research for instance both the <UNK> and the us fire anti <UNK> <UNK> that home in on the missile with <UNK> accuracy however the first successful <UNK> <UNK> weren't done until march of <UNK> by the russians br br there is too much melodrama dr <UNK> <UNK> and his assistant joan woods ellen parker play their romance with about as much wood as a <UNK> cabin <UNK> character cries and boo <UNK> at <UNK> sacrifice like she was at a screen test <UNK> is about as heroic as a bored businessman a scientist phillip <UNK> <UNK> it up so much he makes william shatner look like a <UNK> a bus driver continually <UNK> out end of the world crap in scene after scene the only good actor is the film narrator played by veteran character actor lawrence <UNK> naked city br br all of this could be overlooked if it wasn't for the time line after the <UNK> info is sent to <UNK> the <UNK> brings in a group of scientists a general larry kerr <UNK> that the missile will hit new york city in <UNK> minutes after this there are discussions by scientists and there is a deadly <UNK> as word is sought from <UNK> to see if the missile is an attack from the russians and if a response is necessary br br the film shows the military being fully <UNK> civil defense people leave work and go to their stations eight million people <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> while school <UNK> pick up millions of kids and we get to see the <UNK> new york city i've ever seen though watching 50's sci fi films made it seems like this was the standard the press is kept in the dark for <UNK> of minutes then incredibly a man at the <UNK> <UNK> that the missile will hit <UNK> canada in <UNK> minutes all of the aforementioned action happened in 12 minutes then to add fuel to the fire <UNK> somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien missile he slowly produces a <UNK> of <UNK> loads it in a <UNK> and takes it from <UNK> to a distant missile base to put it <UNK> a missile along the way he is knocked off the road by a wild driver breaks down and then is <UNK> he finally gets the <UNK> back and drives to the base to arm the missile again all this in the same <UNK> minute time frame br br the movie also <UNK> the viewer by making it seem as if <UNK> might be saved only to show men women and children get <UNK> the missile is then said to have five minutes to reach new york <UNK> is still driving to the base 4 more miles to go he gets to the base and arms the missile a two minute <UNK> is then announced all within five minutes the <UNK> of new york should have been at least <UNK> br br by the way the missile is destroyed if you haven't guessed the <UNK> <UNK> destroys it with a massive <UNK> based nuclear blast five seconds later the blast <UNK> and all is clear yeah they caused a nuclear blast equivalent to 100 <UNK> on the <UNK> of new york city and nothing happens br br the film had all the elements necessary to be a good b film but wasted them <UNK> played his character so <UNK> you didn't care that he sacrificed himself in the end you didn't care about the other characters not even the smarmy scientist played by <UNK> the tension that should have moved the film along just wasn't physically possible in the time line allowed it still wouldn't be today not even with jack bauer br br this film is very difficult to find as far as i know it hasn't been re <UNK> on any medium and for good reason i don't know if the film meant to be or if it was standard practice but there's a scene where the government sends all of the best scientists military men and <UNK> into deep <UNK> saying they're too valuable to lose there isn't a single woman or minority in the bunch <UNK> <UNK> is the only black man in the film and he gets a brief bit playing a piano it was worse than 27 days where an alien gives five <UNK> the chance to either save or destroy the planet and he doesn't include any blacks or <UNK> br br i saw this on a special sci fi night on turner classic movies and i don't expect it to show up again if you do find a copy of this somewhere you might want to put it up on amazon com
<START> lucy <UNK> liu and cillian murphy are both excellent actors who can certainly rise to any acting challenge put to them br br unfortunately <UNK> the detectives 2007 ' offers only one to both actors and audience alike not to fall asleep during a mind numbingly boring very predictable and unimaginative story br br <UNK> the detectives 2007 ' tries very hard to be funny but the comedy is forced extremely poorly directed and embarrassing to the verge of complete <UNK> br br after a third of the film still nothing that may capture even the most willing audience like the director's friends and relatives is even hinted at not to mention actually happening br br i'm pretty sure everybody who liked it <UNK> it or had to fake it like <UNK> ex girlfriend did when he showed her an old b w film she couldn't care less about <UNK> the detectives 2007 ' is nowhere near category b it falls somewhere between q r like questions and <UNK> the questions the director knows what he's doing well if his goal was to bore the viewer to death he has done a very good job br br <UNK> the detectives 2007 ' was a complete waste of time for lucy <UNK> liu and cillian murphy <UNK> please don't let it be a waste of your time br br rating 0 out of 100
<START> another detailed work on the subject by dr <UNK> takes us back in time to pre <UNK> <UNK> dr <UNK> chose a difficult subject for his movie debut he has worked on all <UNK> details to bring the story to life the treatment of the subject is very delicate br br even though we have not been to the region during that time the sets and costumes look real unlike most movies made on <UNK> this one focuses not on the gory details of violence to attract audience but on its after effects the characters come to life <UNK> <UNK> has given an impressive performance <UNK> <UNK> has acted his heart out showing the plight of a guilt ridden man the rest of the cast has done a good job too
<START> largely dense road movie with some comic relief provided by the excellent john <UNK> although he is really sending up his performance in <UNK> towers seems to flip from over the top slapstick to <UNK> sentimentality at the drop of a hat and the worst part of the film is that martin and hawn have to find themselves who they are etc see it at your peril
<START> have you seen the graduate it was <UNK> as the movie of its generation but a river runs through it is the story about all generations long before dustin <UNK> character got all wrapped up in the traps of modern <UNK> norman <UNK> and his brother paul were facing the same <UNK> <UNK> of growing up as they tried to find their place in the world but how could a place like post <UNK> montana be a showcase for the american family at a time when the wild west still was not completely gone just what has <UNK> <UNK> into that strikes so deeply at who we all are and what we have to go through to find ourselves as the movie opens norman is an old man <UNK> beside a <UNK> river trying to understand the course his own life has taken the movie is literally a journey up through his own stream of consciousness against <UNK> current and back to when he was a boy he and his younger brother paul were the sons of a <UNK> minister and devoted mother the parents fit <UNK> into their roles mom takes care of house and home dad does the work of the lord the boys <UNK> what they will be when they grow up norm has it <UNK> down to a boxer or a minister like his dad given the choice little paul would be the boxer since he's told his first choice of pro <UNK> doesn't even exist the boys grow up and get into trouble with their pranks fight to see who is <UNK> and do the things brothers do all the while attending church and taking part in all other spiritual matters like <UNK> they are at similar points in their lives before college but when norm returns from his six years at <UNK> things are very different paul is at the top of his game master <UNK> <UNK> of a nearby college and newspaper reporter who knows every cop on the beat and every judge on the <UNK> norman is stunningly well educated for his day but has little idea what to do with his life even as his father <UNK> him about what he <UNK> to do you're left feeling that at least to pops god will call you to your life's work but you have to stay open and ready to receive it all your life father has always taken his boys to reflect by the side of the river and contemplate god's eternal words listen their father <UNK> it's both <UNK> and <UNK> pretty radical for a stoic <UNK> but with all the beauty and <UNK> and even though the <UNK> are truly a god <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> household how is it that <UNK> <UNK> family is <UNK> paul is true perfection as he <UNK> the river but he's feeling the pull of gambling and <UNK> while his family doesn't know how to keep him from <UNK> up where he seems to be headed mom dad and brother all seem to have the same quiet desperation of not knowing what they should be doing and why they can't seem to help <UNK> just waves it all off with a grin and his irresistible charm but the junior brother is losing his grip norman starts getting his life on track finding love and career but paul continues to slide the family that loves him watches <UNK> mother father brother <UNK> in their own ways trying to help but none very effectively how can a family that loves each other so much be so ill <UNK> to handle this how can someone be so <UNK> and full of grace when out in god's nature yet be somehow <UNK> or unwilling to fit into the <UNK> of society that god's peoples have made for themselves these are all questions norman will <UNK> his entire life the eternal words beneath the smooth stones of the river forever haunt him yet keep their secrets the movie is beautiful to watch this is certainly god's country and filming it won an oscar director robert redford plays with the story from the book and <UNK> the narration a bit to follow the emotional pattern he's presenting and it works well but do go back and read the book too you'll see norman made connections with his old man even deeper than the movie can suggest and you'll see the places where the <UNK> very words <UNK> and sing right off the page with an <UNK> of a river running through it leading into the unknown
<START> in sum overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes the director and co writer says he wanted to mix genres in this case drama and comedy well at least here these two mix like <UNK> and oil to boot the comedy is not very funny and juvenile additionally the film is not really realistic liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of <UNK> with drugs in french <UNK> i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on eventually toward the end i fast <UNK> the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex <UNK> son by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover marriage of <UNK> and a nutty ex lover at times the plot <UNK> to the families of the two main characters and then <UNK> back to one of them either <UNK> or primarily nora to the <UNK> of the audience <UNK> keep changing from nora and <UNK> her ex lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed the <UNK> does not really wrap up many of the sub plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow <UNK> chance in hell the actors do their best and are appealing but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing editing and lack of focus
<START> turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget the variety of characters is amazing from axe wielding <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> i enjoyed the relationship between the leads not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going i also enjoyed the mix of humour which can be very easy to get wrong too much not enough which meant it didn't get too dark nor too <UNK> it was a great step up from <UNK> other efforts <UNK> and <UNK> in terms of storyline and production they have a great website which is worth checking out can't wait for <UNK> if the level of improvement continues it should be fantastic
<START> it was in 1988 when i saw the <UNK> and nancy show for the first time on <UNK> television at that time i was already a very big fan of spitting image since when it won the <UNK> rose of the <UNK> film festival in 1986 of course i recorded every show on tape and watched it again and again especially the <UNK> and nancy show i remember that scene when <UNK> stood in front of a painting of abraham lincoln thinking it was a mirror and said to himself i need a <UNK> or most amusing of all when he played ball with his dog but vice versa br br it's such a shame that spitting image seems to fall into oblivion it was one of the most fantastic and most intelligent made tv shows ever compared to other satirical <UNK> it was definitely the best of all br br well almost 20 years have passed since then and i wish i could see the show again is it possible to purchase it from someone somewhere
<START> american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa on the train he met a french girl celine although they met the first time they talked like good friends when the train stopped at vienna jesse <UNK> celine to <UNK> him to have a tour on vienna then the romantic story <UNK> br br at first they were <UNK> the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store they <UNK> at each other though their eyes did not contact after in depth conversation they relationship became close then i saw the most romantic scene that they <UNK> to call their respective friend their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words br br love is a strange thing when you really want it it will not come as you wished love needs mutual understanding without it love will not last long spiritual harmony is the most important for love br br excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie br br one of the best romance movies 9 10
<START> this is not an all around terrible comedy but it is very dull it has barely any laughs and it wastes its lavish production values there is one poignant moment near the end when fu <UNK> offers a dose of his <UNK> to his nemesis and tells him that you've been my one worthy <UNK> and now we can start all over again that scene however along with burt <UNK> amusing cameo in the beginning are the only memorable parts of the movie 1 2
<START> the photography was beautiful but i had difficulty understanding what was happening was there a lot of symbolism the 2 <UNK> do they mean something in <UNK> culture there's not much plot not much happens and it just <UNK> along no real start no real middle and no real end rather unsatisfying really br br it was difficult to get into the characters as you never felt you got to know them it was difficult to know which scenes were imaginary and which were real the move felt chaotic and disjointed i don't know what the <UNK> brothers were hoping to achieve maybe if i were <UNK> it would make more sense
<START> omen iv the awakening starts at the <UNK> frances <UNK> where husband wife karen faye grant gene york michael woods are given a baby girl by sister <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who they have adopted they name her <UNK> at first things go well but as the years pass <UNK> asia <UNK> grows up karen becomes suspicious of her as death disaster follows her karen is convinced that she is evil itself karen then finds out that she is pregnant but discovers a sinister plot to use her as a surrogate mother for <UNK> next <UNK> gets a shock when she finds out who <UNK> real father was br br originally to be directed by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who either quit or was <UNK> was replaced by <UNK> <UNK> who completed the film although why he bothered is anyone's guess as omen iv the awakening is absolutely terrible a disgrace when compared to it <UNK> predecessors the script by brian <UNK> is hilariously bad i'm not sure whether this nonsense actually looked good as the written word on a piece of paper but there are so many things wrong with it that i find even that hard to believe as a serious film omen iv the awakening falls flat on it's face it really does work better if you look at it as a comedy spoof i mean the scene towards the end when the detective comes face to face with a bunch of zombie carol singers who are singing an ominous gothic song has to be seen to be believed i thought it was absolutely hilarious ridiculous in equal measure then there's the pointless difference between this the other omen films in that this time it's a young girl the question i ask here is why seriously why there's no reason at all isn't used to any effect at all anyway then of course there's the stupid twist at the end which claims <UNK> has been keeping her brother's <UNK> inside herself that in a sinister conspiracy involving a group of satan <UNK> it has been <UNK> in karen so she can give birth to the <UNK> is moronic comes across as just plain <UNK> at first it has a certain entertainment value in how bad it is but the unintentional hilarity gives way to complete boredom sooner rather than later br br it's obviously impossible to know how much of omen iv the awakening was directed by <UNK> <UNK> but you can sort of tell all was not well behind the camera as it's a <UNK> cheap looking poorly made film which was actually made for tv it shows with the bland flat unimaginative cinematography production design then there's the total lack of scares atmosphere tension gore which are the main elements that made the previous omen films so effective br br the budget must have been pretty low the film looks like it was the best most stylish thing about omen iv the awakening is the final shot in which the camera rises up in the air as <UNK> walks away into the distance to reveal a <UNK> shaped cross made by two <UNK> <UNK> but this is the very last shot before the end credits roll which says just about everything i have to mention the music which sounds awful more suited to a comedy is very inappropriate sounding the acting is alright at best but as usual the kid <UNK> br br omen iv the awakening is rubbish it's a totally ridiculous film that tries to be serious just ends up coming across as stupid the change of director's probably didn't help either that's still not a excuse though the last omen film to date following the original the omen 1976 <UNK> omen ii 1978 the final conflict 1981 all of which are far superior to this
<START> one of the best movie dramas i have ever seen we do a lot of acting in the church and this is one that can be used as a <UNK> that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work i highly recommend this one especially for those who have an interest in acting as a must see there are several scenes of note for one the graveyard scene when hamlet encounters <UNK> everyone knows about that scene by just going to <UNK> school and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done the logic used in this scene was tremendous i suppose a testament to shakespeare more than anything else for a second i very much enjoyed the scene where hamlet <UNK> and the character played by robin williams discussed the upcoming duel
<START> powers <UNK> turns in a stellar performance as 1970's cult figure jim jones of the peoples temple jones physical <UNK> to jones is uncanny and the story is acted out <UNK> the movie keeps you <UNK> and is a must see for anyone check it out
<START> i don't understand why making remakes has become the trend every remake i have ever seen is awful and this is no exception if any of you have seen the quote from ben jones that it is a sleazy piece of trash he is quite right why they would take a wonderful television show which i loved have never missed an episode and own seasons 1 4 on dvd and ruin it i'll never know the television show was a family show and although daisy has the body it was really <UNK> or even addressed in the show save the outfits a family show has been turned in to a dirty piece of garbage and i wouldn't recommend anyone go see it another thing i didn't like was that john schneider and tom <UNK> are excellent actors along with the rest of the original cast and they are also extremely cute the new bo and luke are not even a little cute that was one of the <UNK> for the show the casting is terrible they could have at least gotten a brunette for daisy i don't think burt reynolds is a <UNK> boss <UNK> either every other role he has ever played is totally opposite this role the only role they cast halfway decent is willie nelson as uncle jesse but still it is no comparison denver <UNK> is an actor all his own and that made him perfect for the role i think that the casting is awful the story is awful and all in all ruined a wonderful show and turned it into a dirty terrible movie i wouldn't recommend anyone go see it i only saw it out of curiosity plus there was a free ticket in season 4 dvd i would never have paid to see this movie but it was free don't pay to see this movie
<START> having loved <UNK> je <UNK> i highly anticipated this film and i admit i went in with high expectations but was sorely disappointed for a number of reasons br br although i was not expecting a re make of <UNK> in new york i was expecting the same structure what i liked about <UNK> was the <UNK> of the <UNK> you got a sense of each directors style and the story they wanted to tell in <UNK> there is no clear <UNK> of the stories at different points in the film characters from different stories run into each other which made me confused as to who i was watching and what exactly was going on also the switch in directing was evident but confusing since there was no flow br br another thing i loved about the <UNK> film was the different takes on love it wasn't all romantic there was love between parents and their children <UNK> love a lonely middle aged woman yearning for love etc it explored so many layers of the complexity of love between humans <UNK> seemed to only go for an edgy over the top sexuality there were some <UNK> shorts the older couple having spent a lifetime together julie <UNK> short but overall <UNK> film didn't evoke any emotion for me i didn't connect with any of the characters like i did with <UNK> i remember watching <UNK> and feeling a deep sadness loneliness yearning <UNK> wonder it just had so much soul for me there was no soul in the <UNK> film br br maybe if i had gone into it without having <UNK> <UNK> in the back of my brain as a comparison this film might have <UNK> a more <UNK> response but as a self titled re take of <UNK> je <UNK> i was sorely disappointed
<START> i remember watching this film thinking was so interesting i really wanted to know what happens next i was amazed by how much they could fit into an 8 minute short we start in a school yard two friends are <UNK> on skipping class kid b says to kid a lets not go to class today and kid a <UNK> claiming they could miss something really important so kid b <UNK> and kid a goes to class when he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn they were going to learn the meaning of life she gives everyone a <UNK> and when she gets to kid a she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share well the kid won't share so kid a goes looking for the teacher when he finally finds her he gets a shocking revelation on what the real meaning of life is i suggest everyone watch this short it will only take 8 minutes from your life but the message is so important it could help you for a life time
<START> so halfway through the season i got so caught up in school and my activities that i didn't realize that the show had been canceled halfway through which is crap br br i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on dvd later maybe then they'll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season br br i loved the show and looked forward to it every <UNK> after the <UNK> can you imagine my disappointment when i came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared needless to say i'm not very happy with fox right now even more so after discovering that no ending was filmed i mean if you're going to work on a project at least finish it to see what happens a half filmed show is like a half made car it's pretty much useless fox film the damn ending and give some of the show's fans some peace
<START> i am an avid fan of lucio fulci and yet i must say that zombi 3 aka zombie flesh <UNK> 2 of 1988 which he made with two other directors bruno mattei and <UNK> <UNK> was quite a disappointment especially compared to its great predecessor <UNK> very own gore classic zombi 2 aka zombie <UNK> <UNK> zombie of 1979 this is vastly disappointing sure the low rating of 4 5 already suggests that it's not a good film but these low ratings usually come from people who are not into italian zombie flicks and as enthusiastic fan of italian horror films and low budget exploitation cinema i love many films that have only been rewarded with much lower ratings also many of my fellow italian horror buffs seem to think of this film as underrated which i sadly cannot agree with not that the film was a complete disaster it has some redeeming qualities above all <UNK> nauseating gore effects that are always a pleasure to watch for an italian horror gore buff the basic idea behind the film is also not bad <UNK> far from original and i liked the ruthless portrayal of the military sadly that's about it while the great predecessor zombi 2 was extremely gory but beyond that also genuinely creepy this is not creepy or scary for a minute and the nauseating and often grotesque gore is the only true reason to watch zombi 3 the film is sometimes fun to watch but only for the gore and as an unintentional comedy i guess that it was mainly the gore that came from fulci and the disappointing rest that came from mattei and <UNK> the first of which was involved in a bunch of nasty cult flicks such as <UNK> porno holocaust and the second of which is responsible for one of the worst movies ever made the god awful <UNK> 2 overall this is definitely watchable for the gore but out of all fulci films i've seen so far this is definitely the worst and i've seen the majority of this great <UNK> <UNK> i am a fulci fan and i always will be but this sure isn't his magic moment it may be fun for the gore but i recommend to watch any other fulci film before this
<START> after being hugely entertained by mr <UNK> performance as a <UNK> in the <UNK> of <UNK> which i rate 10 10 across the board casting acting script story editing pace music emotional impact etc i <UNK> anticipated this film i was hugely disappointed it is a script reading not a film vulgar for the sake of being vulgar <UNK> in every way that the <UNK> of <UNK> is rich and satisfying blame it on the screen writing and directing i sat in the theater waiting for the good part it never came i neither laughed nor cried although one line of dialog did make me smile worth 7 hardly
<START> before all i'd like to point out that i have not read the book so there was no chance i'd be disappointed in that aspect the major flaw i spotted was historical detail with several cars trains clothes etc i think <UNK> belong at that time br br possible spoiler br br the technical aspect of the film is ok nothing to <UNK> about but the acting i think was terrific i don't have no experience in acting still i can't believe how people can consider this terrible maybe they've only seen two movies ever and the other one must have been very good indeed br br i specially liked jeremy <UNK> and really understood his character someone who <UNK> up the social ladder with very hard work then fights against those who would take his life's work from him only he gets so involved in this fight he doesn't realize reason is no longer at his side and he ends up a beaten disappointed man <UNK> made this so believable i <UNK> with the character despite his brutality br br after jeremy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is also wonderful as a romantic young women who is drawn into the revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend <UNK> he had an under developed part i think and glenn close was also very good meryl streep had an average performance it was not bad just not up to the standards of the other actors watch out for <UNK> <UNK> a fine portuguese actor between so many stars br br in contrast to today's movies here only the interpretations only people matter but at the same time it is not a <UNK> film too worried trying to be intellectual the best proof i really liked it i'm writing a review 7 years later
<START> i will never forget this film or the events that lead up to <UNK> in <UNK> it just seems so tragic but needs to be told powers <UNK> give a commanding performance as the leader <UNK> jim jones from obscurity until total madness it would have won him an academy award easily if it was released in the movie theaters it is the kind of mini series you won't forget you won't forget the images of the <UNK> brutality control and <UNK> of it's leader his rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered to be paradise the mass suicide is horrifying almost unreal to <UNK> imagination as to why so many people <UNK> went willingly or <UNK> jones' orders they don't make mini series like these anymore where we're left with out mouths open and hungry to know what happened to the others
<START> as with that film we follow the implausible if always engaging adventures of the 2 lead characters but whilst c j <UNK> sex for a <UNK> trip back into childhood this pair <UNK> in their <UNK> even to the point of exploring <UNK> most of the sex they <UNK> from <UNK> or unwilling partners and yet despite their deeply un pc behaviour everyone emerges smiling like c g through it all they remain <UNK> at heart rebels against the <UNK> the <UNK> the <UNK> as someone else has commented i wouldn't want to know these 2 and it's a minor miracle that their trip brings scenes of mostly comedy and very little tragedy and what there is of that cannot be laid at their door and thus for that reason it left me <UNK> but with a sweet taste in the mouth dare i say that only the french can get away with films like this and that is part of their genius
<START> first of all i think the below comment is <UNK> for a site like this obviously you have no taste and you don't respect the taste of others not to give you a history lesson but i think it needs to be done black actors out there are just if not more successful as others if you are not a part of the black race you cannot understand the quality <UNK> and vibrant of old movies such as <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> high since unfortunately you are not black you do not have the pleasure of feeling what we feel when we watch these classics so therefore you need to keep your freaking mouth shut and just stick to your non dancing race thanks
<START> that's what t v should be and pushing daisies lives up to those expectations a beautifully crafted and well designed show pushing daisies is one of the few shows left on prime time that has integrity is good for the entire family and sparks your imagination it's not about the normal action sex money or murder angles of every other show on t v it's a show that makes you think and laugh but although the basic plot may seem impossible the concepts are real to us all wanting something you can't have hoping for someone to want us running away from your past and searching for family even in the most unlikely of places etc br br i realize that abc has basically canceled this wonderful show at this point and will most likely replace it with some show beyond the point of integrity i suppose everything does come back to money it's too bad that there are now no other shows on abc that actually make you feel good after watching
<START> this is a very fine and poetic story beautiful scenery magnificent music score i've been twice in japan last year and the movie gave me this typical japanese feeling the movement of the camera is superb as well as the actors it goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic japanese people are very sensitive and kind and it's all very well brought onto the screen here the director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details once you've seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director it's a real feel good movie and i can only recommend it to everybody
<START> how do i begin this movie is probably one of the worst movies i have ever seen it has no <UNK> qualities i just sat through this movie and it was a struggle it failed to get even a single smile on my face i find it hard to believe that anyone would <UNK> this horrible film i felt that this movie was a failed attempt at <UNK> humor the only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack i'm pretty sure thats the reason i wanted to see this movie in the first place i will wrap this up as i am going to try and forget the time i just wasted with this piece of crap i will leave you with this warning do not watch this film it sucks
<START> loosely intended as a satire of d w <UNK> <UNK> the three ages was buster keaton's first attempt at a full length comedy feature the only similarities to <UNK> are the opening book scene and the fact that similar stories through the ages are edited together into a complete film keaton's reasoning for <UNK> this style was that if it didn't succeed as a feature film it could be reduced to three two <UNK> fortunately the three ages succeeds brilliantly as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines i've seen in any of keaton's film there is nothing unique or daring about the story lines they are simple boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl plots but the period <UNK> are <UNK> and set the standard for future works by mel brooks and all films of this genre however i don't believe that anyone has ever topped this comedy no one can play the lovable goof like keaton and the stunts in this film are some of his best in addition wallace <UNK> appearance as keaton's rival adds to this film's appeal anyone who thinks that comedy from the <UNK> cannot be appreciated by modern audiences needs to see this movie
<START> eddie izzard is genius with his non stop humor i could listen all day his unique approach to life is quite logical his understanding of discovery such as the <UNK> <UNK> is creative eddie izzard captures the heart of what we think i don't know when i laughed so hard at anyone's off beat mind
<START> i was not only an extra in this movie i got to see it in boston to a sold out cinema over a thousand boston red sox <UNK> fans <UNK> themselves into a movie theater near boston common to watch a comedy about them red sox fanatics drew barrymore and jimmy fallon star is this cute comedy about love and lust the love is between the two young lovers the lust is for the red sox winning the world series although fallon is not a great actor he is the best actor for the role he is funny enough and gets the most laughs barrymore on the other hand is the same old barrymore at times i felt supporting actress <UNK> <UNK> would have been a better actor for the role all in all all boston red sox fans will love this movie for the rest of the world this is just a funny movie
<START> i couldn't tell if the screaming skull was trying to be a hitchcock rip off or a <UNK> edgar allen poe tribute these days someone would have chopped it up a bit and presented it as one of those tv anthology episodes from the old tales from the dark side but only after an extensive rewrite br br the sad thing is there seems to be a nice nasty little story trying to get out from under the <UNK> of this movie and the actors are obviously doing the best they can with both their talent and the material they have to work with but the director just didn't know how to stage or pace a dramatic scene the special effects simply didn't work the screenplay <UNK> its <UNK> plot points so <UNK> that a <UNK> could have seen them coming and the soundtrack kept playing german <UNK> band music when it was supposed to be trying to scare the audience br br they tried they tried really hard but this is of interest only as a period piece i suppose someone very young who hadn't seen a lot of suspense or horror might get a charge out the screaming skull but someone that young probably wouldn't get most of the subtext or plot motivation <UNK> why is that nice man trying to scare the <UNK> faced <UNK> cat lady
<START> i find it very intriguing that lee <UNK> jackie <UNK> sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the <UNK> to make big edie and little edie the subject of a film they certainly could be considered the <UNK> in the family closet the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion <UNK> <UNK> some of their ideas to these oddball women i'd say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these <UNK> fascinating i e are they nuts or am i missing something this movie is hard to come by netflix does not have it <UNK> does though
<START> my only minor <UNK> with the film i grew up knowing as <UNK> to heaven is the fact that the wonderful raymond massey is <UNK> to the last twenty or so minutes in the trial scene and the trial itself imo is the least interesting portion of this fascinating fantasy br br david niven and kim hunter are wonderfully cast as the young lovers but it's roger <UNK> who gives the <UNK> and most credible performance french <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a delight he even gets in a remark about technicolor as the heavenly <UNK> sent to <UNK> niven when his wartime death goes <UNK> due to an <UNK> <UNK> has some of the <UNK> lines and delivers them with <UNK> br br seeing this tonight on tcm for the first time in twenty or so years i think it's a supreme example of what a wonderful year 1946 was for films the technicolor photography somewhat subdued and not <UNK> at all is excellent and the way it shifts into b w for the heavenly sequences is done with great imagination and <UNK> br br the opening scene is the sort that really draws a viewer into the fantasy aspects of the story and <UNK> tense talk with radio <UNK> hunter while his plane is crashing toward earth unexpectedly leads to a memorable romantic encounter truly a marvelous film from beginning to end another triumph for michael powell and <UNK> <UNK>
<START> i had never seen richard thomas play a bad guy i wasn't sure i would like him this way and i wasn't sure he could pull it off but this <UNK> me he sent <UNK> up my spine and caused me to take a closer look at street people the movie is engrossing and fast paced bruce <UNK> is convincing but all he can really play is a nice guy the real talent here is thomas the ending was a little clumsy but perhaps that's the way real people would fight if you are a thomas fan you must see him here at his best being bad
<START> ironically the most talked about american film in the 2008 new york film festival is 98 in spanish the extra long film's controversy began at the cannes festival there were love hate notices and considerable doubts about commercial <UNK> as <UNK> the star <UNK> del toro got the best actor award there i'm talking about steven <UNK> <UNK> ' of course that's the name it's going by in this version shown in new york as at cannes in two 2 hour plus segments without opening title or end credits <UNK> is certainly appropriate since <UNK> che guevara is in almost every scene del toro is impressive hanging in <UNK> through thick and thin from days of glorious victory in part one to months of <UNK> defeat in part two appealing and <UNK> in all his varied <UNK> even disguised as a bald <UNK> man to sneak into bolivia it's a terrific performance one wishes it had a better setting br br if you are patient enough to sit through the over four hours with an <UNK> between the two sections there are <UNK> there's an authentic feel throughout fortunately soderbergh made the decision to film in spanish though some of the actors oddly enough in the english segments especially are wooden you get a good outline of what <UNK> <UNK> che style was like the teaching the <UNK> of <UNK> the morality the discipline the <UNK> and the fighting as well as che's <UNK> <UNK> from company doctor to full <UNK> military leader use of a new 9 pound 35 <UNK> quality red digital high performance <UNK> camera that just became available in time for filming <UNK> <UNK> peter andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold but at times still sing and are always sharp and smooth br br the film is in two parts soderbergh is calling them two films and the plan is to release them <UNK> as such first is 'the <UNK> ' depicting che's <UNK> in jungle and town fighting that led up to the fall of <UNK> in the late 50's and the second is <UNK> ' and concerns che's failed effort nearly a decade later in bolivia to <UNK> a revolution a <UNK> mission that led to <UNK> capture and execution in 1967 the second part was to have been the original film and was written first and i think shot first producer laura <UNK> says that part two is more of a thriller while part one is more of an action film with big battle scenes yes but both parts have a lot in common too much since both spend a large part of their time following the <UNK> through rough country <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> since the <UNK> revolt was doomed from the start the group of <UNK> who tried to lead it didn't get a friendly reception from the <UNK> <UNK> who suspected <UNK> and thought of the cuban <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> there is a third part a kind of <UNK> black and white <UNK> made up of che's speech at the united nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time but that is inter cut in the first segment the first part also has <UNK> and is considerably more upbeat leading as it does to the victory in santa clara in 1959 that led to the fall of the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> in cuba br br during <UNK> i kept thinking how this could indeed work as a quality european style miniseries which might begin with a <UNK> version of walter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and go on to take us to <UNK> <UNK> meeting with <UNK> in mexico and <UNK> in the <UNK> of july movement there could be much more about his extensive travels and <UNK> missions this is far from a complete picture of the man his childhood interest in chess his <UNK> interest in poetry the books he wrote even his international fame is only touched on and what about his harsh cruel side really what soderbergh is most interested in isn't che but revolution and <UNK> <UNK> the lasting impression that the 4 hours leave is of <UNK> through woods and jungle with wounded and sick men and women and idealistic dedication to a the cause of ending the <UNK> of the rich someone mentioned being reminded of <UNK> <UNK> 'the tin red line ' and yes the meandering episodic battle approach is similar but 'the thin red <UNK> has stronger characters hardly anybody emerges <UNK> besides che and it's a really good film this is an impressive but unfinished and ill <UNK> effort br br this 8 years <UNK> heavily <UNK> labor of love how many more <UNK> must come to pay for it is a vanity project too long for a regular theatrical release and too short for a miniseries radical editing or major <UNK> would have made it into something more successful and as it is it's a long <UNK> especially in the second half br br it's clear that this <UNK> could have been <UNK> down though it's not so clear what form the resulting film would have taken but with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one
<START> it's a bit easy that's about it br br the graphics are clean and realistic except for the fact that some of the <UNK> are <UNK> but that's <UNK> the rest of the graphics are <UNK> than <UNK> and many other <UNK> games the sounds are <UNK> everything from the speaking to the <UNK> are pleasant and realistic br br the camera angle is a bit frustrating at times but it's the same for every platform game like <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> kong 64 br br i got this game as a christmas present in 1997 and since then i have <UNK> gotten <UNK> stars over 10 times
<START> this insipid mini <UNK> featuring a eddy <UNK> prototype in a <UNK> scenario is so bad it becomes an <UNK> exercise after five minutes it's silly from the get go as this <UNK> opens two military men discussing the lack of <UNK> in the son of one of the officers in under a minute he is packed off to <UNK> where he lives a double life as the red shadow the leader of an arab tribe that would rather sing than fight br br alexander gray and <UNK> <UNK> possess fine light opera voices with little acting ability and there's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so <UNK> scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along br br this two <UNK> was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers with more room to spoof and <UNK> the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed <UNK> is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation
<START> i saw this movie as a very young girl i'm 27 now and it scared me witless for years i had nightmares about every aspect of this film from the way it was drawn to the music to obviously the violence my parents still argue about who allowed me to watch it and both of them say that they would never let me watch such a movie i think they only say that knowing that i have such strong feelings about it 0 i am currently reading the book out of morbid curiosity and the fact that it's a classic and it is really a great story however i don't think that it should have been made into a cartoon ever well maybe kids nowadays would find it quaint but it gave me nightmares for weeks and weeks and i still have a hard time seeing <UNK> drawn in a similar way gives me a little heart <UNK> every time <UNK> i am a <UNK> but i strongly suggest that any parent looking to show this movie to their kids read them the book instead or watch it first to make certain that they <UNK> of the content not everyone finds it as disturbing as i did but we are out there 0
<START> when ritchie first burst on to movie scene his films were <UNK> as funny witty well directed and original if one could compare the hype he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal loathing his last two <UNK> have created one should consider has ritchie been found out is he really that talented does he really have any genuine original ideas or is he simply a pretentious and <UNK> director who really wants to be <UNK> tarantino and <UNK> all rolled into one <UNK> and <UNK> heap after watching revolver one could be <UNK> for thinking were did it all go wrong what happened to his great sense of humour where did he get all these mixed and convoluted ideas from revolver tries to be clever philosophical and <UNK> it tries to be an intelligent <UNK> it tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller ritchie does make a <UNK> effort to <UNK> all these many <UNK> and <UNK> great <UNK> of a script into existential <UNK> and numerous plot twists however in the end all it serves is to <UNK> a severely disjointed <UNK> and ultimately <UNK> film to the audience its <UNK> is so <UNK> and blatant that although ritchie does at least attempt to give his own spin he should be <UNK> for even trying to pass it off as his own work so what the audience gets ultimately is a terrible screenplay <UNK> with many pretentious <UNK> and clumsy <UNK> br br revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and bland movie that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces like fight club usual suspects and pulp fiction it aims high but inevitably shots <UNK> <UNK> br br revolver deserves to be <UNK> it is a truly poor film <UNK> as a wannabe masterpiece from a wannabe auteur however it falls flat on its <UNK> face and just fails at everything it wants to be and achieve
<START> don't see this this was one of the dumbest movies i have ever seen its hard to be mormon sometimes when there are movies like this out there what a sad view of mormon life i can tell you if you did see this movie that it is not all like this at all in a <UNK> ward if it was i don't think i would have made it through it its too bad that most mormon movies are made by a group of <UNK> who have nothing better to do the acting was so bad that my wife and i barely made it through i guess you could say that it had all the signs of a b movie or are there c movies anyway i just thought this movie sucked and was full of cheese i wish some <UNK> would start making some quality movies
<START> way back in 1967 a certain director had no idea about a galaxy far away or near he was trying to complete a movie with the title <UNK> etc this short is a <UNK> history of a certain george i am sorry it has only <UNK> to defend it this is merely an advertising <UNK> for the director actors et al it has little <UNK> artistic value it is a <UNK> the lead playing george is very fine as is the leia character and the <UNK> darth character all else is plain commercial <UNK> what a waste still it got the job done i guess the rest of the movie is merely <UNK> water to kill time i guess a <UNK> only
<START> i'm not a big fan of the <UNK> slapstick but i find their history interesting i've recently tried to check out stuff from each <UNK> era but the opportunity to see joe shorts doesn't seem to come easy this is the only one i've seen so far br br some say the quality problems with joe era shorts are really not <UNK> fault and i suspect that's the case joe as a performer is far from the worst thing about this the thing that bothers me the most about it has been pointed out in another comment the <UNK> of the other guys against the third <UNK> the whole comedy team stooges <UNK> perhaps <UNK> style was perceived by those in charge as not really fitting in though there were no real off camera conflicts between him the others and this was their way of working around that br br and what's with the titles of this and some of the other late stooges shorts definitely a lack of creativity going on there was that sort of thing the cause or the effect of the shorts market <UNK> up
<START> this movie answers the question how does a relationship survive when your girlfriend is <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> jealous and has powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal women br br without spoiling the movie i can safely assure you it does not but there's great fun to be had along the way uma thurman is perfect as the <UNK> super heroine an uber babe mysteriously named g girl who unlike most in her <UNK> is not always dedicated to truth justice and the american way br br thurman is also believable as the thoroughly <UNK> yet somehow still <UNK> <UNK> jenny when she is dumped for a less <UNK> but more emotionally secure and well <UNK> rival g girl goes <UNK> and what follows is not pretty it's funny but it's not pretty br br it's a delightful premise hell <UNK> no fury like a super heroine <UNK> and those involved don't altogether carry it off but it has its moments and i think i'll get the dvd br br i liked this movie
<START> one question that must be asked immediately is would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of <UNK> lee <UNK> kennedy <UNK> br br the answer is probably not br br but thankfully they are or were the cousin and aunt of jackie br br this documentary by the <UNK> brothers on the existence one could hardly call it a life of edith b <UNK> jr and her daughter edith <UNK> <UNK> edie has the same appeal of a train wreck you don't want to look but you have to br br big edith and little edie live in a once magnificent mansion in east <UNK> new york that is slowly <UNK> around them the once beautiful gardens are now a jungle br br magnificent oil painting lean against the wall with cat <UNK> on the floor behind them and beautiful <UNK> of them as young women <UNK> for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines br br living alone together for many years has broken down many <UNK> between the two women but <UNK> others br br clothing is seems to be <UNK> <UNK> favorite costume is a pair of shorts with <UNK> <UNK> pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and <UNK> around her <UNK> and head br br as edith says edie is still beautiful at <UNK> and indeed she is there are times when she is almost <UNK> and both women show the beauty that once was there br br there is a constant <UNK> of sexual tension br br their eating <UNK> are to be polite strange ice cream spread on <UNK> a dinner party for <UNK> birthday of wonder bread <UNK> served on fine china with plastic <UNK> br br time is irrelevant in their world as edie says i don't have any <UNK> br br their relationships with men are oh so strange br br edie feels like edith <UNK> any of her attempts at happiness she says if you can't get a man to <UNK> to you you might as well be dead to which edith replies i'll take a dog any day br br it is obvious that edith doesn't see her role in <UNK> lack of male <UNK> early in the film she states france fell but edie didn't br br sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said both women talk at the same time and constantly <UNK> each other br br there is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film edie <UNK> the <UNK> in the attic with wonder bread and cat food the cats and there are many of them are everywhere br br at one point edie declares the hallmark of <UNK> is responsibility but they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselves br br this is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort
<START> the literary genius of <UNK> <UNK> is brought to the screen again and many in the <UNK> world will take notice the director puts us in check mate with the story of alexander an <UNK> <UNK> study of chess addiction <UNK> is <UNK> in a <UNK> <UNK> resort where a chess championship is being <UNK> she meets alexander by picking up a queen piece he drops thru his coat pocket a <UNK> attraction <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> the next day the mother <UNK> <UNK> the husband he arrives and questioning alexander we get these fades to the past <UNK> godfather ii where we see young alexander a child <UNK> he is taken under a school teachers wing and exploits his genius for 10 <UNK> making vast sums thinking alexander reached his peak <UNK> him but becomes legend the old teacher returns causing harm trying to give victory to an old rival of alexander in a serious chess game where world chess champion victory is one way to <UNK> the chess clock <UNK> match time ends to conclude the next day that day is <UNK> wedding the old teacher <UNK> and alexander is sent on a nervous breakdown <UNK> holding her stomach and looking thru her <UNK> coat finds his <UNK> for the match and follows the moves though the film unfortunately <UNK> from its russian roots its low back cut dresses are lovely alexander plays his role <UNK> the director <UNK> her audience we hardly ever get to play and the only hint of the luzhin defense is after <UNK> queens <UNK> the opponents king with your 3 <UNK> king <UNK> the castle for mate <UNK> is a great match but feel its conclusion deserved more intensity but maybe the emotions were right on check for chess meant more to him than her the luzhin defense <UNK> gives <UNK> honor the complexity of his work in images is a world event not to be missed
<START> buster absolutely shines in this episode which is the only vehicle i've seen towards the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical and silent comedy that made him famous it's still a shock to hear his <UNK> voice in the <UNK> sequences his voice is about the only thing i don't care for as far as buster is concerned but his ability to take a <UNK> is still <UNK> he even repeats some of the gags used in his early two <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> br br my deepest <UNK> to rod <UNK> for presenting us with this episode and for giving <UNK> genius full scope he didn't have much time one episode to do it in but this is a touching tribute to hollywood's greatest genius
<START> i've seen this film literally over 100 times it's absolutely jam packed with entertainment powers <UNK> gives a stellar performance as a fan of actors such as william shatner <UNK> 1974 and ron <UNK> up the academy 1981 i never thought an actor could capture the intensity like shatner and <UNK> in those roles until i saw <UNK> as jim jones as far as i'm concerned powers <UNK> is jim jones this film captures his best performance
<START> perfect movies are rare even my favorite films tend to have flaws rear window looks a little <UNK> at times chris <UNK> character in <UNK> day doesn't work the music score in best years of our lives is too cheesy the beginning of nights of <UNK> is a little too slow but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish br br the script is brilliant the acting is superb all around although reese <UNK> and sam <UNK> are amazing the whole cast shines the directing and the photography are inspired and the music score is touching without being <UNK> like some <UNK> scores that are too manipulative every sad moment is truly moving every light moment makes me smile this truly is one of the best films i have ever seen and i wish there were more films like it br br i am glad that reese <UNK> has gone on to stardom after this film but i am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more <UNK> and silly than this serious film which is about real people real feelings and real problems brilliant a must see
<START> this movie makes <UNK> and brits out to be <UNK> moronic idiots the men get stoned drunk and then they yell beat each other up in almost every scene the women are superfluous to the story  i do not understand what they are there for  they spend every scene causing a <UNK> or worse <UNK> around like <UNK> cattle apparently canadian women are either <UNK> vulgar <UNK> or <UNK> hippie chicks it's the standard knocked up girlfriend her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother <UNK> that we have seen in countless movies before br br every character here is a <UNK> <UNK> stereotype not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower and the idea of any kind of scene <UNK> sex with george <UNK>  <UNK>  is enough to make anyone gag i watched the movie because samuel west was in it  but i cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this maybe he needed the money ian <UNK> is a superb actor the only one with a vague redeeming moment but his talent is wasted here br br as for the rest of the plot  the three <UNK> trying to get their <UNK> back  yawn or karl  who is dead but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind almost like rebecca in alfred hitchcock's masterpiece  although i am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films why even bother karl is so <UNK> that you find the circumstances of his death <UNK> br br by the end of this wretched movie i thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat
<START> first of all i am not a huge fan of contemporary turkish cinema which is because the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the <UNK> this movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with <UNK> as the director and marketing ads imply in my mere opinion the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive <UNK> in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country cheap <UNK> might provide with a brief definition of what i meant br br however the acting is near perfect in fact most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what <UNK> lacked talent all members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well <UNK> for the job even the less experienced ones like <UNK> at least <UNK> deserves a small word of appreciation just because he knows well how to choose the cast other than that he is just a media monkey who <UNK> himself a director with an artistic talent come on art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked half naked women and just because media boasts off no director becomes a <UNK> in the history of turkish cinema just close your ears and o something real artistic i am waiting eagerly to applause your next work hope this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach br br in short pros good acting hot women just kidding cons each and every single thing other than the cast
<START> japan <UNK> the story of 16 year old <UNK> begins with the death of her father as it will be revealed later both of her parents have died of <UNK> in this desperate situation <UNK> aunt has arranged a marriage with a japanese man in <UNK> whom they know only from its picture by her arrival in <UNK> <UNK> discovers that her new husband is much older as in the photograph and that he lives in very humble circumstances beside a sugar <UNK> <UNK> were he works on <UNK> not used to the hard <UNK> on the <UNK> and in despair over her situation in her new home thinks of running away she soon discovers that she has nowhere to go the friendship to <UNK> a female co worker of hers gives her new hope and strength this picture is based on real events between <UNK> and the 1920s when thousands of asian woman were married off to men in america whom they only knew from their picture this not very well known picture is well written and acted the location is breathtaking this film also features <UNK> <UNK> in his very last screen appearance as a <UNK> narrator of silent movies this film gives some insight of japanese culture here and across the ocean a must see
<START> all <UNK> reed fans must see this the film's premise has struggling romance novelist <UNK> unable to come up with any new ideas she's also getting over a divorce however she meets this guy at a restaurant and he helps her out of her shell and clothing they go into a corner room and they do it thankfully <UNK> gets a <UNK> out now don't ever tell me these playboy films are worthless <UNK> of soft core fluff remember kids safe sex later she <UNK> to her <UNK> how great it was but she didn't get his name despite this the guy finds her and they continue their kinky games but eventually she <UNK> of his <UNK> and wants to know more when she does all hell breaks loose and i'll leave it at that this is easily the best of these soft core <UNK> films i've seen check this out and marvel at the greatness of <UNK>
<START> i had such high hopes for this film because i loved the original so much it seems that disney however is trying to perfect the art of crappy straight to dvd sequels they deserve a <UNK> several in fact i thought the idea had merit but the music was absolutely awful and the story wasn't much better what happened to the great music disney used to have in their films mary <UNK> <UNK> beauty and the beast the lion king even <UNK> and the <UNK> of <UNK> dame they've made so many great movies over the years that it's really sad that they've sunk to point of making sequels that aren't even good enough to put in theatres br br i hope this movie is not an indication of things to come for the walt disney corporation
<START> with movies like this you know you are going to get the usual jokes concerning ghosts eva as a ghost is pretty funny and the other actors also do a good job it is the direction and the story that is lacking that could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better the problem only is that there aren't many jokes sure i laughed a couple of times apart from the talking parrot there wasn't an ounce of creativity to be noticed in the movie i blame the director not using the premise to it's full potential eva certainly has the comedic skill to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so overall this movie is ideal for a sunday afternoon other than that it can be <UNK> completely
<START> this movie is <UNK> funny the acting is wonderful the ramones are sexy the jokes are subtle and the plot is just what every high <UNK> dreams of doing to his her school i absolutely loved the soundtrack as well as the carefully placed cynicism if you like monty python you will love this film this movie is a tad bit grease <UNK> without all the annoying songs the songs that are sung are likable you might even find yourself singing these songs once the movie is through this musical ranks number two in musicals to me second next to the blues brothers but please do not think of it as a musical per say seeing as how the songs are so likable it is hard to tell a carefully choreographed scene is taking place i think of this movie as more of a comedy with undertones of romance you will be reminded of what it was like to be a rebellious teenager needless to say you will be <UNK> of your old high school days after seeing this film highly recommended for both the family since it is a very youthful but also for adults since there are many jokes that are funnier with age and experience
<START> this has by far been one of the most beautiful <UNK> of a person that i've ever seen on screen andy goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon <UNK> he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it's primitive in a good sense his <UNK> honesty and kindness <UNK> clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life <UNK> pieces of art i was amazed how <UNK> he created his pieces and how <UNK> he accepted their end sometimes <UNK> but his scottish sense of humor covers his <UNK> brilliantly the film is shoot <UNK> and contains the same flow that <UNK> art has it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself fred <UNK> score is <UNK> enough that it <UNK> everything together without <UNK> with it <UNK> sound this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect it has no boundaries as far as age goes
<START> jessica <UNK> max and valerie <UNK> <UNK> original cindy shines in this <UNK> and atmospheric serial wonderfully politically incorrect quality <UNK> greatly from episode to episode but generally the standard is high and when it is not jessica is always worth looking at <UNK> urban <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> almost dragging dark angel into sitcom territory
<START> i'll get to the movie in a minute first someone wanted proof about <UNK> comments at <UNK> where he claimed that the usa deserved the 9 11 attacks well here's what <UNK> said br br in the first <UNK> when the christian soldiers took <UNK> they first burned a <UNK> with 300 jews in it and <UNK> to kill every woman and child who was a muslim on the temple <UNK> i can tell you that story is still being told today in the middle east and we are still paying for it br br we're still paying for it <UNK> mean we <UNK> the marines didn't storm the temple <UNK> br br but in truth <UNK> never really came out and <UNK> said that we deserved 9 11 like all his statements during his <UNK> he implied that we deserved 9 11 just point out fact a b c and maybe d and let the <UNK> <UNK> that they must add up to conclusion x when in truth most of <UNK> facts added up to <UNK> br br but that's beside the point we're here to talk movies not politics unfortunately when oliver captain conspiracy stone does a movie you can't escape his <UNK> politics it was only a matter of time before he focused his paranoia and <UNK> on the reagan era and what better time than when <UNK> dreams almost came true on the day reagan nearly bought the farm unable to find any <UNK> plots or schemes in <UNK> assassination attempt he <UNK> one with al <UNK> from a simple <UNK> of the chain of <UNK> authority <UNK> is transformed from a public servant who really should have <UNK> up on his <UNK> <UNK> into a raving <UNK> you almost expect <UNK> to rub his hands together like <UNK> burns and tell cap <UNK> to release the <UNK> stone even <UNK> the <UNK> person in hollywood to play our former secretary of state richard dreyfuss a guy you love to hate on sight br br overall the movie is ok average <UNK> on below average don't bother renting or buying try to catch it on cable 4 out of 10
<START> this movie delivers the best is when the awkward teenage neighbor tries to bike away from the babysitter and in the background looks like he's never been anywhere near a bike in his life as he attempts not to fall off br br but this movie doesn't stop there when less than 5 minutes later it delivers a scene of nothing but an arm reaching through a fence and into a <UNK> pulling out a beer br br stereotypical <UNK> <UNK> several plot lines that go nowhere and a former <UNK> actress with a <UNK> cell phone all add up to making this the perfect saturday night at home
<START> this film really deserves more recognition than its getting it really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties <UNK> and <UNK> within the crime world the film is shot beautifully and <UNK> into all you're classic crime themes such as betrayal and power this film is a movie goers film it requires attention and understanding and <UNK> fully in the end it is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china it features an <UNK> of great characters actors and development although is fair to say i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film all in all 8 10 great plot characters but there are characters that don't stand out enough and the music didn't really get me going and at times i felt it didn't sync well with the action there is action by the way so it loses some points for that
<START> i loved that this film <UNK> the intelligence of the viewer allowing the layers to <UNK> from the characters through their interactions with each other about the <UNK> loss that has so affected each of them br br the cinematography is a beautiful and is an inspired reflection of the vision of someone i believe is an extremely talented new filmmaker with the maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that others with much more experience have failed to accomplish i see a bright future for this writer producer director who had the ability to focus on a goal and accomplish it with integrity br br kudos for this achievement
<START> first of all i'd like to tell you that i'm into comics anime animation and such stuff it is true that everyone has his own <UNK> but you can trust me on this movie i'll be objective to begin with the story it's ok follows the story line of the comic books as far as i'm familiar with them but the animation well it's not actually terrible but it's definitely cheap and mediocre it would be a lot better if they didn't try to imitate the anime style and <UNK> to the original comic book style drawings if we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and <UNK> you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more looks a little bit like the original vampire hunter d from 1985 take a look at heavy metal <UNK> 2000 for instance 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better in addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable the music is nothing special so all in all it lacks atmosphere i watched it but i cannot tell i really enjoyed it it just does not capture you there's plenty of blood and violence but that does not impress me at all may be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time is there anyone around but i don't think this is the audience for this movie so they could add a little nudity and spice to it the chicks around <UNK> were quite tasty and hell we have lady death herself there are few sexy looks but that's not enough instead of bill <UNK> music i think it would look better on a hard rock heavy metal soundtrack all in all the movie isn't that bad but if you want something better take the original heavy metal heavy metal <UNK> 2000 ralph bakshi's fire and ice or <UNK> maybe and of course vampire hunter d <UNK>
<START> this thing was bad really bad i mean low budget can sometimes be very inspiring but not this the story was so off the shelf the <UNK> behaviour so illogical the characters so <UNK> i found nothing good in it and i did try
<START> here is one of those movies spoiled by the <UNK> <UNK> on a happy ending conflicts which have stretched out for years are settled in a few minutes it would have been far more interesting to <UNK> a tone of ambiguity the talented barbara stanwyck is <UNK> by a sudden <UNK> from independent and <UNK> woman to a <UNK> female of the kind she has put down all her life brent as usual is well over his head and then there is the ludicrous situation of gig young playing a character named gig young someone mentions gig young and then who appears but gig young the actor worth seeing though far below what it could have been
<START> warning minor spoilers br br i ran into this one <UNK> through and watched from there not knowing what it was or what the plot was it certainly held my attention i didn't know until the ending that it was based on a true story the guy she used to do the dirty deed came out looking like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around by a <UNK> girl i have to question how true to life that portrayal is anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they slept just can't be entirely nice still i did have some sympathy for him as he had been set up and taken advantage of that much was made clear br br my main complaint is with the ending here comes the biggest spoiler skip this paragraph if you don't want to learn it a few minutes before it ended there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered the way it got discovered was in a <UNK> operation but my question is how did the police get convinced to go along with it the movie didn't show us that and it seemed a bit too convenient absent the explanation of how they were <UNK> to do it br br i think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes as the <UNK> of the explanation <UNK> an aura of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldn't have been there we would already have known what the scene was about and what was going on with brad in it br br otherwise this is a pretty good film i give it 7 10 it made me think now i'm interested to find out the facts of the real case br br one more thing the movie was done in 1996 some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a more recent movie br br p s <UNK> <UNK> is lovely i hadn't seen her before she can act a little too always a plus in her line of work lol
<START> <UNK> <UNK> characters are brought to life in <UNK> of human bondage but the movie is a too <UNK> version of the novel with bette <UNK> star making performance sucking up all of the energy otherwise it's the story of leslie howard as philip carey he dreams of becoming a painter but is told he has no talent for the arts as the film progresses mr <UNK> struggles instead to become a doctor his efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts though successful in medicine his painting seemed easier also note the symbolism of his <UNK> a club foot explained in the film br br along the way right away in this version howard becomes <UNK> with waitress davis as mildred rogers <UNK> characterization of mildred is extraordinary culminating in a spectacular speech when she tells howard among other things that she had to wipe my mouth after kissing him howard also performs well but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for davis so their performances are wasted br br still a film to watch for the acting including some good supporting players bette <UNK> characterization was famous for inspiring a write in campaign for the 1934 best actress academy award for the record she placed third the results were br br 1 <UNK> <UNK> it happened one night br br 2 norma <UNK> the <UNK> of <UNK> street br br 3 bette davis of human bondage br br 4 grace moore one night of love br br of human bondage 6 28 <UNK> john <UNK> leslie howard bette davis <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this movie will be a hit with those that enjoy <UNK> mindless explicit <UNK> about sexual exploits and f in almost every sentence like a good plot like comedy like romance or other human values stay away from whipped it was so bad i left after about half an hour i saw two kids slip in that looked to be about 10 very <UNK> this deserves an x
<START> a great and truly independent film that hit most of my emotions and carried me into another world isn't this why we go to the movies i was especially impressed with the editing and the music the combination of which was very <UNK>
<START> well there is a plenty of ways how to spoil a political thriller usually they are derivative or too ambitious often they feature a conspiracy that is totally <UNK> and unbelievable but city hall does not do neither of the above mentioned the plot is cleverly crafted story is believable as far as characters go i would say this movie is a solid average no character seems out of place and al pacino is brilliant as always his portrayal of a charismatic nyc mayor is superb and proves again that al pacino belongs to the absolute top of american actors nowadays
<START> kurosawa is a proved <UNK> this movie is totally about people living in poverty you will see nothing but angry in this movie it makes you feel bad but still worth all those who's too comfortable with <UNK> should spend 2 5 hours with this movie
<START> to say this film stinks would be insulting to <UNK> as the other <UNK> says this movie is insulting to anyone over the mental age of 7 it is especially incredibly insulting to gays it is awful and not in a so bad it's funny sort of way either it's just plain awful no i have to say it it stinks sorry <UNK> br br from the opening credits to the end titles there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes for the plot is incoherent the characterization non existent the acting is of the over the top <UNK> look at me i'm being funny school and so it goes on the set pieces are clumsily set up if at all and are badly executed it's just awful on every front apart from the music maybe i don't remember thinking the music stinks apart from the songs br br to be fair to the makers they lay their cards on the table pretty quickly the opening credits include the title also starring <UNK> <UNK> as the voice of betty the meteor since as the meteor in question turns out never never say anything but make an occasional <UNK> noise they may well have lifted ms <UNK> contribution from one of her records and the second line of the movie runs something like and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around <UNK> <UNK> your <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> huh huh your <UNK> the humour really is that cheap br br it says strange things about the comedies of that period in that it was perfectly <UNK> for the hero to deliberately shoot people dead in the street but not say sh t out loud br br i paid fifty <UNK> about 1 00 for this movie in a sale i feel ripped off
<START> i saw this movie on a <UNK> american <UNK> flight it was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer the plot had potential who wouldn't love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every elvis <UNK> she meets but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of elvis <UNK> is on the roof of a casino <UNK> the sky thinking he's going to return then a group of stars moves together to form an elvis <UNK> which promptly shoots a <UNK> of lightning at the <UNK> sending them crashing through the roof bad really bad which is the theme for the whole movie i'd avoid this one at all costs
<START> jeff <UNK> is not only a hunk he can kick butt this movie has some of the best martial arts moves i've seen in a very long time ok so maybe <UNK> <UNK> isn't the first person i'd hire to play a ruthless politician she did a great job <UNK> and let's not forget that <UNK> has a partner in this movie played by martial arts expert <UNK> karen <UNK> so she's not <UNK> <UNK> who cares she's just as good if not better just check out her fight scene at the end of the movie one word <UNK> my suggestion would be to buy this movie as soon as possible because if you haven't seen it you're really missing out on some great martial arts action
<START> i watched this tape immediately <UNK> it watched it again and laughed twice as hard i strongly recommend this tape for those who are not hateful of but uncomfortable around <UNK> it shows you that <UNK> is a feature rather than the entirety of one's being the comedy is not single issue this man is brilliant all comics should <UNK> to his level of <UNK> intelligence and talent
<START> i am a big fan of stephen king's work and this film has made me an even greater fan of king pet sematary is about the <UNK> family they have just moved into a new house and they seem happy but there is a pet cemetery behind their house the <UNK> new neighbor <UNK> played by fred <UNK> explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery that burial ground is pure evil <UNK> tells louis <UNK> that when you bury a human being or any kind of pet up in the burial ground they would come back to life the only problem is that when they come back they are not the same person they're evil soon after <UNK> explains everything about the pet sematary everything starts to go to hell i wont explain anymore because i don't want to give away some of the main parts in the film the acting that pet sematary had was pretty good but needed a little bit of work the story was one of the main parts of this movie mainly because it was so original and gripping this film features lots of make up effects that make the movie way more eerie and frightening one of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back was in fact the make up effects there is one character in this film that is truly freaky that character is <UNK> this particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise <UNK> is rachel <UNK> sister who passed away years before but rachel is still haunted by her the first time <UNK> appears in the movie isn't generally scary because she isn't talking or anything but the second time is the worst and to be honest the second time scares the living out of me there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie it is almost perfect pet sematary delivers great scares some pretty good acting first rate plot and mesmerizing make up this is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time 10 out of 10
<START> this movie is cold bare truth often we think oh no that won't happen to me but it can drug <UNK> is big money and often people are <UNK> or tricked into doing things for <UNK> the story of these two girls is the story of many young people who like them only wanted a exotic holiday which turned into a nightmare people need to know that these sort of events aren't improbable or exaggerated this is a major problem in today's society br br i would recommend this movie to mature viewers because of the understanding needed to truly appreciate this movie it is very emotional and raw well worth watching and certainly stays in your memory
<START> it's a difficult movie to <UNK> 10 items or less generally i don't care about defining genres but there's something about this movie that makes you want to put it in a specific category in order to <UNK> even with only one word your feelings about it i completely recommend this film to anyone and if you truly enjoy cinema and if you enjoy life you'll want to do the same as soon as you've finished watching it br br i recommend this movie and call it beautiful and delightful <UNK> it's not perfect but it doesn't do anything wrong i don't want to sound like i <UNK> myself but i believe writer director brad <UNK> knew exactly what he was getting into when he finished writing this inspiring script i'm sure he wanted to achieve a product that had nothing to do with perfection a product that would be as simple appealing and <UNK> as its title well he's done it br br <UNK> director of long complex dramatic movies like city of angels and <UNK> mile proves with 10 items or less which <UNK> in at just 70 minutes the passion he has for his work and also the faith he has in it to put an actor morgan freeman in front of a woman paz vega in a <UNK> store and take them exactly to the places ordinary life would take them is what <UNK> <UNK> here br br i can't tell you no more because within the apparent simplicity lies a thought provoking background that shouldn't be <UNK> because here everyone's exposed the camera focuses directly on the two main characters who share endless conversation in a car ride with stops that's not endless only because life is life and let me express how praise how well <UNK> handles the situation by saying that he reaches in less time not only in movie duration time but in the single day that the movie develops its events and in a smaller place the kind of connection between two characters that <UNK> coppola generated in lost in translation br br that movie set in tokyo also encountered an actor and a woman and they also had conversations about the moments they were living in their lives it's in the conversations where we sense the though provoking quality of 10 items or less and just as in <UNK> movie the <UNK> of every situation is never lost and the images with all music and no words don't seem forced or included in the picture to <UNK> <UNK> br br in this aspect the collaboration of <UNK> and his director of photography <UNK> <UNK> the man who shot the beautiful <UNK> in <UNK> and focused on every emotion in <UNK> adams <UNK> us here with visual <UNK> of true natural beauty br br but the ultimate beauty of 10 items or less can be found in its cast by <UNK> kaufman in its two protagonists they are the ones who <UNK> this feeling i mentioned at the beginning and i can't <UNK> we feel their connection and we can tell they're having fun and that they may even be <UNK> stuff academy award winner morgan freeman also an executive producer of the film simply stands there and <UNK> the status he has today in the movie industry and one that's well deserved a quiet man filled with wisdom that can easily make you cry as he can make you laugh and the beautiful paz vega well i said she was great in <UNK> <UNK> she proves she's the real deal and hollywood's not small for her
<START> jake speed is a film that lacks one thing  a charismatic lead unfortunately that's something that really <UNK> the entire movie and it's a shame because at heart it is an enjoyable action movie with a witty enough script and an interesting if derivative premise although it's <UNK> probably can be <UNK> back to the success of the indiana jones trilogy  the film actually plays a little more like <UNK> the <UNK> albeit in reverse it's not an author of romantic adventure fiction being led on an adventure by a character very much like one of her creations it is an adventure fiction character who happens to <UNK> his own adventures leading an ordinary woman on one of his adventures br br when a young woman goes missing in paris her sister margaret played by the appealing <UNK> <UNK> gets <UNK> with pulp hero jake speed wayne crawford and his sidekick dennis dennis christopher who both turn out to be real and very flawed individuals in an adventure that takes them into the heart of a civil war torn african state and ultimately into the <UNK> of two brothers the deliciously evil sid john hurt and his ridiculously camp sibling maurice roy london that's the plot  it's not <UNK> and it's not complicated but the story that it tells doesn't require great depth br br the action sequences are appealing to begin with and it's certainly true that the heroic trio are put through their <UNK> whether caught in battles between government and rebel forces or being dropped into a pit full of lions and there are certainly some quite funny lines however the film does seem to struggle to find an ending and unfortunately the action sequences that are quite appealing to begin with go nowhere and ultimately become a bit bland and <UNK> this however may not have been such an issue if it was possible to like jake speed but due to wayne <UNK> performance it becomes harder to really care what happens now i don't know if he was <UNK> himself a little thin as he was also the producer and writer of the movie or whether he's simply not a good actor as i haven't seen him in much else but he never really convinces as a <UNK> mixture of doc savage indiana jones and jack <UNK> br br this is a shame because most of the other characters play their roles well  karen <UNK> is funny and convincing and her character shares some nice banter with jake unfortunately it never convinces dennis christopher is perfect as the <UNK> sidekick and john hurt plays the part with camp <UNK>  almost as if he were in a sixties episode of batman he <UNK> about his few scenes <UNK> in a ridiculous cockney accent putting in a performance that almost belongs in another film sid is no <UNK> he is presented as <UNK> nemesis from a number of his previous adventures books but he is always fun to watch br br jake speed tries to channel the same fun b movie spirit as <UNK> of the <UNK> a film produced by crawford a few years beforehand and almost succeeds but misses  which is a shame because jake would have been good to watch in a few more adventures and may have been served better by a television series br br i would recommend this out of curiosity appeal but ultimately it leaves a bitter taste because most of the elements were there to make something genuinely good
<START> as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice <UNK> and <UNK> 9 <UNK> bo <UNK> flight scenes in this movie one of the few <UNK> was the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in this case an <UNK> <UNK> 75 maverick missile painted black with the letters <UNK> <UNK> in white along the side real <UNK> <UNK> definitely do not look like that at least not the ones i've seen br br but apart from that it's an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending the last minute anyone interested in seeing various swedish military <UNK> including the now legendary <UNK> on film should see this one br br
<START> for those who'd like to see this movie i'd say go without the narration it might be a very good movie documentary but the music the narration and some of the <UNK> story lines make it very hard to watch for a <UNK> person like me following several animals their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we're watching but the melodramatic point of view just doesn't cut it for me moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey one exception left there the camera <UNK> out or <UNK> to another scene i ask myself why that happens if they were to show reality why cut the scenes that a melodramatic fairytale remains i think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd cause after all it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet
<START> this series would have been a lot better if they had just done one simple thing made ian <UNK> code name diamond head instead of code name tree diamond head the character needs someone who could handle the role of the lovable rogue which <UNK> proved he could do with the <UNK> series roy <UNK> the actual diamond head is really only so so in the role <UNK> is not really that good as the bad guy tree france <UNK> character <UNK> <UNK> can't seem to make up her mind as to whether she's the hapless victim or the tough and ready to fight woman she really earned her pay at the end when she had to play the role of diamond <UNK> lover after viewing an episode or two i ended up not caring what happened to anyone tree gives us a lot to hate him but diamond head gives us nothing to like him unfortunately the spy genre in the 1970s was not quite as it was in the 1960's
<START> i could never stand watching happy days after <UNK> joined the cast so i knew i was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured scott <UNK> a <UNK> chase scene jodie foster in her first grown up role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess two hours out of my life that i'll never get back no noteworthy characters unbelievable storyline questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all i couldn't have cared less the story of california teens in the 1970's where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots don't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie
<START> the movie remains in the gray for far too long very little gets explained as the movie progresses with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch it sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way i'm going to do that it is that i watched this movie in the morning i'm sure of it that if i watched this movie in the evening i would had fallen asleep to me the movie was like a poor man's blade runner br br the movie leaves far too many questions and <UNK> it makes the movie leave a pointless and non lasting impression br br also the weird look of the movie doesn't help much the movie is <UNK> cgi <UNK> real life but it's not done <UNK> as good impressive spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as sin city and 300 they even created <UNK> of the characters of the movie by computer which seemed like a very pointless and odd choice also considering that the character animation isn't too impressive looking sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously wasn't cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really isn't a positive thing to say br br some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting the main god of the movie constantly says lines such as <UNK> going to do this but it's none of your concern why i want to do <UNK> than just don't say anything at all mr <UNK> it's irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie if you don't care to explain anything about the plot also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its script br br the actors still did their very best they seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special so i can't say anything negative about them br br the story and movie is far from original it rip offs from a lot of classic and semi classic mostly modern science fiction movies it perhaps is also the reason why the movie made a very redundant impression on me br br a failed and uninteresting movie experiment br br 3 10
<START> iq is a wonderfully original romantic comedy that <UNK> the greatest and deepest thinking scientific minds of the 20th century as <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of heart and mind is the central theme of this light hearted yet thoughtful movie you don't quite know how to react because part of the time you are seeing great scientists do silly things to <UNK> budding love but at other times you hear them discuss some of the deepest <UNK> of space time of our age the end result is a fun movie with surprises throughout walter matthau is a perfect einstein meg ryan creates a quirky <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and tim robbins brings to life the <UNK> of a poorly educated working man who is fascinated by science all together they create a <UNK> trip through love and science mind and heart
<START> the <UNK> genre is strangely overlooked by most screenwriters thankfully highly acclaimed director nelson <UNK> has brought us the second best <UNK> movie of all time rated lower than side out and higher than well <UNK> however don't let the cover of this movie <UNK> you kill shot stars up and coming star <UNK> as a modern day sherlock holmes using such high tech <UNK> as a computer that is less powerful than my <UNK> <UNK> is able to aid fbi agents in the tracking of a man who has not committed any obvious crime while there are other actors in the movie including brief cameos by denise richards a gay <UNK> and a <UNK> ugly and annoying girl <UNK> carries this movie on his own any fan of movies such as the matrix or <UNK> will definitely love kill shot
<START> the godfather of television but aside from it's acclaim and mobster characters the two are nothing alike tony soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks his psychiatrist learns that tony is actually part of two families in one family he is a loving father yet not so perfect husband and in the other family he is a ruthless <UNK> after analysis dr <UNK> concludes that tony's problems actually <UNK> from his mother <UNK> who's suspected to have borderline personality disorder gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character yet <UNK> and <UNK> aren't nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother respectively <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles van <UNK> from the e street band plays his first and only role as tony's best friend and is quite convincing and <UNK> <UNK> the only recurring actor to have actually appeared in a godfather film plays tony's uncle and on and off nemesis many fans also enjoyed characters played by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> lip <UNK> and <UNK> tony's children are okay but not notable with the exception of <UNK> stunning performance in the third to last episode the second coming <UNK> and <UNK> are unconvincing and over the top but the show is too strong for them to hold it back even as the show continues for over six season it <UNK> to have a dull or predictable moment br br out of four
<START> you know i went to see the hills have eyes 2 wanting to like it i really enjoyed the original and the remake was fairly entertaining they obviously had more money to throw around than wes craven did on special effects the second time around even though i still prefer the original film the remake was done well and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me bloody intense and great special effects in short a great popcorn movie for any horror fan br br which brings us to the hills have eyes 2 man where do i start the plot or lack of one is paper thin we are not exactly breaking new ground here the military has decided to <UNK> the area and all of these people turn up missing so what do we do now let's send in the national guard to investigate in true hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumbest and worst soldiers ever seen gee i've never seen that premise before to make a long story short you have the mutants killing off the moron soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion once again the special effects by <UNK> are great but the kills no matter how graphic become boring and predictable honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck it was bloody and graphic but i found it predictable boring and not scary at all for me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thought wes craven and his son shared the writing duties and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror films but sadly this isn't one of them
<START> when it comes to horror movies i am more than willing to suspend disbelief ignore sub par production values and overlook plot holes in the interest of a good scare this movies simply has no good scares to offer it can't even be enjoyed as camp bad dialogue bad acting bad direction the kills were predictable and poorly staged the music was annoying the camera work was wretched even the costumes were bad i felt really bad for the actors who were obviously trying but who had to deal with terrible contrived dialogue and an obvious lack of direction i doubt they got any rehearsal either it's embarrassing to watch and so boring than making it through to the contrived surprise ending requires tremendous <UNK> it's quite easily one of the worst movies i've ever seen br br i don't normally write reviews but this one was so bad that i felt compelled to warn others this movie is a complete waste of time if you must watch this movie don't miss the making of <UNK> the writer director seems to be under the impression that making the killer a woman was kind of bold daring move seen it he and the cast spend half an hour <UNK> this film as if it's a new age citizen kane it's like listening to a group of third <UNK> take you behind the scenes of their christmas <UNK> they truly think they've created something of substance it's sad <UNK> the only reason i gave this movie a 2 is because i think 1 should be reserved for true atrocities like <UNK> hands of fate and space <UNK> so american nightmare isn't the worst movie i've ever seen but i'd have to say that it's somewhere in the bottom fifty
<START> a doctor and a policeman in new orleans have only 48 hours to locate a killer infected with <UNK> plague br br an effective and classy little thriller directed by <UNK> kazan that <UNK> documentary realism with a race against time <UNK> <UNK> set and filmed in and around new orleans panic in the streets is taken from the story <UNK> some like 'em cold by <UNK> and edward <UNK> who won an oscar for original story it also boasts a fine ensemble cast that deliver top rate performances for their director in turn richard widmark bringing the method a year before marlon did for kazan in a <UNK> named desire paul douglas jack palance as walter jack palance the wonderfully named zero mostel all get <UNK> moody as the <UNK> chase the pursued to halt the <UNK> of a potential black death <UNK> br br where the film scores its main suspense points is with <UNK> <UNK> ability to cut back and forth between the protagonists without <UNK> the flow and mood of the piece from <UNK> public health doctor with <UNK> <UNK> in hand running around trying to locate the bad guys so he can do good to the bad guys themselves who are <UNK> as to why there is such a wide scale hunt for them the tension is <UNK> up to fever breaking point to which thankfully the final thirty minutes becomes a cracking piece of cinema with palance <UNK> as a nasty villain that ironically puts one in mind of <UNK> own tommy <UNK> from kiss of death three years prior br br it's an imaginative and intelligently written story one that <UNK> <UNK> rats and criminals to being <UNK> of disease a <UNK> on society as it were it's <UNK> elements such as paranoia blend nicely with its basic <UNK> thriller being while some memorable scenes are suitably <UNK> by the <UNK> atmosphere that kazan has created although some of the early character <UNK> threatens to steer the film down some over talky based <UNK> this definitely is a film worth staying with to the end not essential film noir and maybe not even essential kazan but certainly a highly recommended film that begs to be discovered by a new generation of film lovers and <UNK> by the old guard who may have missed it back in the day 7 5 10
<START> i rented the video of the piano teacher knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box i did this with some <UNK> because films that win awards at cannes are usually very good or very bad unfortunately this one falls in the latter category about one quarter of the way into it i found myself saying out loud this movie is boring about half way through i was saying to myself where have i seen this before at the three quarters mark i had figured it out br br in spite of its literary origins this film is essentially a remake of robert altman's much earlier 1969 and better that cold day in the park although the details obviously <UNK> and altman's work was more plot driven and less of a character study the two films are <UNK> identical there is nothing new to be seen in this production every aspect of it has been done before a character <UNK> out of control with increasingly self destructive behavior <UNK> <UNK> bad lieutenant 1992 a perverse and doomed <UNK> culminating in an operatic near death scene david <UNK> m <UNK> 1993 <UNK> brutal sex scenes david lynch's blue <UNK> 1986 and so on hence i am <UNK> by the fact that so many found the film to be shocking shattering etc this highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable and clearly succeeded with some however i largely <UNK> such a reaction to a lack of film viewing experience see enough movies and you really will eventually have seen it all and while it is true that i saw the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> version i doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of the piano teacher br br technically the film is not without merit there is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent isabelle <UNK> <UNK> performance also helps save it from being a waste of time this is the first of <UNK> films that i've seen and if i were to see more i expect i would have the same opinion of him that i have of <UNK> an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be rating 4 10
<START> i am a huge fan of ted v <UNK> and the original corpse <UNK> is the main reason why but this is quite possibly the worst film i have ever seen even the brilliant casting of the legendary liz <UNK> desperate living could not save this worthless piece of garbage this film should serve as a lesson to all past present and future film makers when you have a film as successful as the original corpse <UNK> was you should probably leave sleeping dogs lie and you should definitely not try to <UNK> it over twenty years later unless you have the financial backing to pull of a superior sequel such as <UNK> gordon lewis did with blood feast 2 all u can eat even if you do decide to do this you should probably spend a little bit more money than you did on the original and for god's sake never film a movie onto video why do film makers even attempt to do this when everyone knows the quality is going to turn out hideous i personally have yet to see one film made in this fashion that's even worth the <UNK> to blow it to hell if you can't afford to make a sequel that is better than your original film then sell the rights of the film to someone who can and what was ted v <UNK> thinking about or smoking when he wrote this god awful script i mean come on dog and cat aliens from another planet a cardboard box painted to look like a devastating machine capable of <UNK> up human bodies bones and clothes and all if any of these actors aside from liz <UNK> were paid more than five dollars for their hideous performances than they are grossly <UNK> avoid this film at all costs and watch the original instead
<START> so <UNK> what i called a bad bad film poor acting poor directing terrible writing i just <UNK> stop laughing at some scenes because the story is meaningless <UNK> waste your time watching this film well i must recognize it has one or two good ideas but it´s <UNK> badly <UNK>
<START> according to imdb as well as to every other website that holds a review this thing doesn't have a director well that would surely explain a lot just a bunch of people that gathered together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultra thin storyline about devil <UNK> and women sacrifices inside the walls of a secluded <UNK> <UNK> is a prime example of totally demented 70's <UNK> as it's really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration horror movies about satanic <UNK> were hugely popular during the early 70's and pornography as well so why not combine the two here we have a simplistic story about a young <UNK> girl who's committed to a mental asylum and from the first night already she's drawn into a network of drugs psychedelic <UNK> rape torture and <UNK> action really a lot of <UNK> action the friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her but she has her throat <UNK> even the same night the horror aspects are truly poorly <UNK> going from laughably un scary satan masks to <UNK> severed <UNK> attacks the photography and acting performances are almost <UNK> amateurish but what do you expect from a film that features footage of <UNK> firing <UNK> and talking <UNK> male <UNK> organs leading lady <UNK> <UNK> is a rather good looking girl with a ravishing body but most of her co stars male female are hideous and <UNK> haired sleaze balls
<START> no movie with madeleine <UNK> in its cast could possibly be unwatchable that said i have to add that this british film comes close the story takes place on board the ss <UNK> and it's loosely based on the <UNK> unfinished voyage the word <UNK> is spoken the liner strikes an iceberg and we hear a heavenly choir sing <UNK> my god to <UNK> ' the doomed passengers eventually take over the <UNK> in a clever bit of sound work but the year of the film's release <UNK> means that a modern viewer has to accept otherwise primitive sound and many of the acting conventions of silent films and the stage these aren't problems the film's major flaw is pacing and pacing had been well developed in <UNK> however if the dialog were delivered at a realistic speed the movie's running time would be cut in half the intended effect was drama and clarity in a new medium but the result <UNK> is tiresome now the film's structure is <UNK> illogical and inept <UNK> i found certain details of the editing quite modern in technique fine abrupt cuts from one area of the ship to another sometimes even on sound effects although we're on board the <UNK> from the first shot we were well over 4 minutes into the movie before i discovered that fact there are long <UNK> musical <UNK> by the <UNK> dance orchestra entertaining easy sound personal stories are presented in an utterly <UNK> and unconvincing way don't even think of spectacle the <UNK> is a tiny thing and the exterior damage it does to the <UNK> <UNK> is a minor <UNK> however the scenes of passengers <UNK> into the <UNK> clearly staged on a real liner presumably tied up to a <UNK> generate great excitement other than the glorious miss <UNK> these sequences are the film's only points of excellence as the movie and the ship near their end the screen goes totally black several times when the power <UNK> begin to fail their last eternal <UNK> is the end of the film with a sunset sunrise tacked on a clumsy symbolic effect <UNK> is a cinema curiosity at best br br
<START> this is a case of a bunch of people thinking they are so clever they have a story that fits the time remember the all around political <UNK> caught on camera in the years leading to the <UNK> and a little later most movies trying to cash in on made for tv <UNK> so powerful o so mind <UNK> <UNK> were in fact caught in their own <UNK> <UNK> attitude br br i was never a fan of the conversation which i find as much dated as others conspiracy <UNK> of the time but coppola was true to his main character and hackman was a pretty engaging actor to observe i mean these conspiracy movies are mostly drowning in the character pool of noir heroes lots of questions unanswered lots of <UNK> communication well this takes at least bergman to build a movie about such un visual <UNK> br br the next man is a perfect example of its time one political soup served with an idealistic character and an horrendous conspiracy <UNK> its web around him neither part is interesting in itself and the whole doesn't get any better in fact you can tell how much it will be bad from the very first sequences <UNK> up <UNK> <UNK> murders without ever <UNK> any storyline pedestrian directing at its worst as most of the movie is one pompous <UNK> of scenes revolving around violence <UNK> brought under the viewer's eyes
<START> i always said that the animated batman movies were much better than the live action films br br i've seen all of the animated films but out of the bunch this is the <UNK> and it's rather disappointing br br mask of the phantasm would rank as the best then world's finest then sub zero then return of the joker and finally this ranks last br br in this <UNK> animated movie there's a mysterious new <UNK> in <UNK> and batman is intent on discovering whether she's friend or <UNK> as she sets out on a quest for vengeance br br but as bruce gets involved with three young women he begins investigating them and discovers who is the new <UNK> br br the tone in this film is unusually light considering most of the films are grim and bleak which was rather disappointing bruce acts strangely out of character most of the time the villains are re used from the last films and while the action scenes are exciting they're really nothing new it also lacks the dramatic impact the other films have especially that of sub zero which was heavy in drama and character development br br everything in the film feels pretty recycled and the supporting characters are charming but no one is actually worth rooting for br br all the while i really enjoyed this i had a blast and the identity of the new <UNK> is surprising but this wasn't as exciting as i'd hoped br br half out of
<START> wwe <UNK> december 17 2006 live from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br kane vs <UNK> in an <UNK> match so this is the fourth ever <UNK> match in the wwe and it is kane vs <UNK> wonder why was it the first match on the card i only viewed the ending parts where kane sets <UNK> ass on fire as they're on the <UNK> and then <UNK> is running around the <UNK> while yelling  eventually the <UNK> put out the fire with a fire <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> around the entrance <UNK> funny and visually quite entertaining ending 7 10 br br wwe tag team championship this was originally supposed to be william regal dave taylor vs brian <UNK> paul london c in a regular tag team match however <UNK> teddy long comes to the ring and <UNK> that it's going to be a fatal 4 way tag team ladder match <UNK> and the <UNK> are thrown in and it's all chaos one word to describe this eye opener  wow man i really can't remember how many sick spots there were in this match and words can't really do it justice there was one particularly notable spot where the <UNK> set up a ladder in a see saw position and jeff jumped off the top rope while matt held <UNK> for the kill and then <UNK> <UNK> blew away while <UNK> apparently <UNK> it and was bleeding like hell with <UNK> over his face he had to be taken away and <UNK> continued the match alone another spot was when jeff <UNK> london while flipping off the ladder there were other high flying breathtaking spots too many to remember london finally <UNK> the <UNK> to win this rave show <UNK> 8 5 10 br br the boogeyman vs the <UNK> the two men get thrown in

chris benoit c faces off <UNK> <UNK> in yet another typical <UNK> match some good spots included a <UNK> off the top rope by <UNK> and an unusually long chain of german <UNK> by benoit <UNK> <UNK> comes in the ring with the belt to nail benoit but benoit scares her off and takes a long time deciding whether to put her in a <UNK> or not this allows <UNK> to go for a roll up but benoit rolls it up once more and <UNK> is locked in the <UNK> game over nice hard fought battle albeit slow at times 7 10 br br wwe <UNK> championship gregory <UNK> c vs jimmy wang <UNK> for this one in a fairly <UNK> paced match the match had some good high flying spots  most notably <UNK> moves off the top rope  but the crowd didn't seem to be into it after witnessing the ladder match and <UNK> needs to get more <UNK> <UNK> won the match after blowing <UNK> away with a <UNK> on the <UNK> 7 5 10 br br the undertaker vs mr kennedy in a last ride match after a series of matches between these two this time it is a last ride match the second ever of its kind and the winner has to <UNK> his <UNK> out of the <UNK> in a <UNK> pretty good indeed for what these two could offer kennedy <UNK> a good deal of taker and even broke free of a <UNK> to throw taker off the <UNK> set about 15 feet below and thank god for kennedy otherwise it would've been brutal kennedy almost got the win until taker got back up inside the <UNK> i liked the camera view inside the <UNK> taker then missed a steel <UNK> <UNK> on kennedy and broke the <UNK> window instead but then later <UNK> kennedy open with a chair and followed with a <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> on the <UNK> roof kennedy was unconscious and taker drove him out of the <UNK> to win i actually found myself really interested into these <UNK> <UNK> to take give real sick shots 7 5 10 br br santa comes into the ring i go what the hell like many of the kids in the crowd and then the word <UNK> contest gets in my ear break time br br <UNK> john cena vs <UNK> king booker talk about charisma vs <UNK> this match was actually a quite good main event with the momentum <UNK> shifting from one team to the other and <UNK> good suspense even <UNK> got some legitimate good shots on his opponents this time i kind of <UNK> his strength against the <UNK> and him and booker mainly didn't succeed in trying to cheat  except at one point where booker <UNK> his <UNK> into <UNK> throat <UNK> hits the bomb on booker for the win didn't get to see the f u cena performed the 5 <UNK> <UNK> anyhow and i think he also did the <UNK> this was probably the best technical match of the night and the participants did superbly indeed for what they could without a ladder 7 5 10 br br being an on and off wwe fan i have to agree that <UNK> was laced up with numerous eye <UNK> throughout and the ladder match ultimately <UNK> half of the show the last ride match featured some fairly nerve wrenching spots and the main event also did very well for its category all other matches also lived up to their billing except perhaps the boogeyman vs the <UNK> bout and the ever useless <UNK> contest overall <UNK> was a highly enjoyable pay per view and despite some big <UNK> earlier in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> wishes this year's goodbye <UNK> <UNK> rating 8 10
<START> i am a huge charlton heston fan he is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time but what was he thinking when he made this movie normally if he made a bad movie i could blame it on the screenwriter or director but in this case it's all him the <UNK> of this movie is all his fault it proves that not even heston can make a shakespeare story interesting i wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this <UNK> fest and i'll never get that time back this is by far the worst heston movie that i've ever seen if you are a shakespeare fan maybe you'll find this movie entertaining but if you're not don't waste your time you'll regret it in the long run
<START> potential spoilers br br man this movie was awful a catholic <UNK> suspense thriller it goes over already well <UNK> ground from previous movies br br the <UNK> priest sex and the <UNK> politics and religion church <UNK> conspiracy involving the church the dawn of a new evil age all kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil br br pretty stupid and lame with a weak storyline to suffice the story revolves around two concepts <UNK> better known as the <UNK> of <UNK> the sick the last rights a person can ask for to <UNK> one's sins while on the brink of death and <UNK> the act of cutting a person off from the church basically an <UNK> person can't receive <UNK> thus comes in the sin eater and i'll leave it at that throw in all the <UNK> things i already listed and you have the order br br i found the sex scene with the priest <UNK> with shots of a picture of the virgin mary rather insulting to <UNK> it also ends with heath ledger saying i <UNK> i am the <UNK> and <UNK> of sins i live on without love blah blah blah cue him walking in dark alley with long <UNK> coat <UNK> the matrix br br i gave this movie a 1 for not only being crappy and unoriginal but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process if you want to see something better i suggest the prophecy with christopher walken
<START> i've been watching a lot of cartoon or animated movies because i have a baby girl who likes to watch tv i began to watch this movie to see if i would like my little one to watch it and no at the beginning i thought it was such a cute movie like the <UNK> movie but all the way it was like <UNK> the <UNK> was a homosexual the info said that they were making fun of him because he wasn't good at sports but that was not the case it just seems like a movie made for kids to learn to be okay being gay it was also very sad as far as the <UNK> dad and all i don't know i guess if you're gay you'd like it but i don't think i'm going to watch it again with my little one
<START> it is quite a simple not very active but very charming film there were moments where i can see why cher won the academy award for best actress but there were other times when i wondered why glenn close didn't win for fatal attraction anyway oscar and golden globe winning and <UNK> nominated cher plays loretta <UNK> a simple woman with a low pay job who has just been asked by mr johnny <UNK> danny aiello to marry him he promises her he'll be back in a month as his mother is sick so she mean while needs to get as much of his family to attend the wedding as possible only problem is when she finds <UNK> one <UNK> brother <UNK> golden globe nominated nicolas cage they start having a relationship and there love goes on to that moon scene where the title comes from also starring oscar nominated vincent <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> oscar <UNK> and golden globe winning olympia dukakis as rose <UNK> and john <UNK> as perry it ends with no wedding for johnny and loretta but she and <UNK> were happy together it won the oscar for best writing screenplay written directly for the screen and it was nominated for best director for norman <UNK> in the heat of the night and best picture it was nominated the <UNK> for best score for dick <UNK> and best original screenplay and it was nominated the golden <UNK> for best motion picture comedy musical and best screenplay it was number <UNK> on 100 years 100 quotes snap out of it it was number 17 on 100 years 100 passions and it was number <UNK> on 100 years 100 laughs very good
<START> lynch the man has some really great stuff he knows how to <UNK> us then reward us by getting us think in different ways this however is altogether different <UNK> reward is 1 absurd comedy earned by enduring 99 stupidity i may have laughed once but somewhere around episode 4 i just started watching on fast forward didn't miss a thing i felt <UNK> when it ended and that's part of the point with this series it's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations rounded out with annoying animation voices and sound but <UNK> this and its other <UNK> qualities still fails to make <UNK> worthwhile
<START> i just have to throw my two cents in relax it's a comedy yes for the most part the characters are <UNK> written and acted i can't think of many comedies where they aren't this isn't a new release it's out on video and <UNK> on cable almost every week would i see it in a theater sure i did when it first came out it's funny that should be enough br br even if i didn't like it at all i'd still watch it on cable for michael keaton he's an underrated and under appreciated actor i can't think of another who is so capable in every genre nor can i think of one who's as successful a comedic actor who's also an action star short lived but still who's also a romantic lead who's also a dramatic actor a villain and a hero i can't think of any at least not in hollywood certainly none who have been successful at all those genres i mean there's tom cruise but to me he's better at being tom cruise than becoming a character however this isn't about michael keaton vs tom cruise so i'll move on br br <UNK> ho is worth renting heck it's worth buying since you can probably find it for 10 00 or less at stores like wal mart it's worth watching on cable if you have cable or satellite it's one of those fun to watch movies you can put your brain on pause and just relax and chuckle away br br to ask for more in my honest opinion is asking too much
<START> this movie is just so awful so bad that i can't bear to <UNK> anything other than just a few words avoid this movie at all costs it is terrible br br none of the details of the crimes are re <UNK> correctly lots of <UNK> footage weird cuts and edits no continuity to the plot the acting is absolutely the most amateur i have ever seen br br this bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of it's content the camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky it looks as if it was shot on video br br in fact now that they've got dennis <UNK> with life in prison i wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as well br br seriously don't even think about watching this one i'd give it a negative star if i could
<START> saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released had me <UNK> like a baby as i left the theatre trying not to let anyone see so when i saw it again now in <UNK> i knew what to expect the <UNK> were ready <UNK> as their required moment approached thankfully this time i was at home br br what i hadn't remembered from my youthful viewing or perhaps hadn't noticed because of it was the technical brilliance of this movie the use of flashbacks which tell so much story without <UNK> to dialogue the camera work which seemed to place the viewer together with the characters in the scene think of the opening when joe is crossing the street to the diner the camera pans behind the woman child sitting on a <UNK> in the <UNK> framing the street scene br br the story itself the characters seedy sad brutally real it is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely <UNK> then again joe ratso could be any of us must have been <UNK> when i saw it i recall that upon leaving the theatre i was <UNK> to find the company of friends all these years later i'm glad i'm not alone tonight this is one hell of a great movie
<START> i <UNK> this film the original phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery like many 70s horror flicks it looked and felt like some creepy unfinished documentary phantasm ii from the late 80s <UNK> up the action but <UNK> this nice attention to mood sadly phantasm iii is just awful it <UNK> explains all of the weird happenings in the previous films which <UNK> rather than <UNK> their power it shamelessly <UNK> imagery from the first phantasm like a cheap <UNK> of the original there are so many flying <UNK> in this movie that they seem more like household <UNK> than menacing death <UNK> hundreds hang from the ceiling like christmas balls <UNK> in the draft didn't anyone the prop master the <UNK> the editor the director notice or care that they looked so crummy even worse phantasm iii presents one corny unfunny joke after another how different from the intensity of the first film the original phantasm used humor to <UNK> its relentless focus on death phantasm iii uses death to set up countless cheap jokes about <UNK> <UNK> several refer to the film's flying balls ha ha oh i get it balls maybe the crew got a kick out of these jokes but they are on us
<START> while there aren't any talking animals big lavish song production numbers or <UNK> with half white half black hair it does have 1 thing realistic people acting normally in a strange <UNK> and walt roy did in their <UNK> with the studio if you thought think the <UNK> or the island at the top of the world weren't identical or you hold them to a higher authority than atlantis then your <UNK> is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a <UNK> cartoon
<START> back in the day i remembered seeing dumb <UNK> power comics that had the same artwork as this show and then word came up that this show was a coming to a television near me i was not <UNK> but curious i was curious about how bad this show was gonna suck my friends all said that this show had no real meanings and was too silly for straight people like me to enjoy i'm actually gay so i decided to watch the show with low expectations br br what a horrible experience first off i hate the new characters <UNK> and <UNK> are so dumb and i hate how so many <UNK> <UNK> over <UNK> it's sad i also hate how they made chef <UNK> or whatever his <UNK> name was a good guy who owned a restaurant bad move <UNK> tv <UNK> is nothing but a loser <UNK> to the king <UNK> who sucks big time in this show and i hate the face of that one company that keeps <UNK> <UNK> with those awful weapons to destroy <UNK> so stupid i hate this show br br i then began to hate <UNK> even more since it was obvious <UNK> was just <UNK> to get <UNK> some popularity <UNK> never beat mario in the fight for <UNK> and <UNK> will always be nothing but a tiny little cream <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> said
<START> opening night released in 1977 tries to be an ambitious production it succeeds only in the truly stunning performance of gena rowlands her character of theatre actress myrtle is not necessarily someone we would love in real life she is self absorbed often obnoxious and makes life miserable for those around her in other words not unlike some actresses myrtle is also a woman on the edge of collapse we are not quite sure if the demons she is fighting are real or imagined although we are let in on the secret early rowlands is obviously well directed with love by her gifted husband actor director john <UNK> who has a role in the film as well this film is not without flaws it is overly long and the last part of the film where myrtle goes on stage while very drunk seems almost cruel the <UNK> in some of the dialogue at least while on stage goes on way too long some of the supporting characters give good performances especially from ben <UNK> playing <UNK> sleazy producer joan <UNK> character is never fully developed and i never could figure out why she was in the film except to <UNK> myrtle see this film for rowlands alone she is fascinating throughout and it is tough to take your eyes off her although you will want to at times
<START> part two picks up not where the last film left off as part of the quasi <UNK> of steven <UNK> epic 4 hour event che's two stories are told as classic rise and fall scenarios in part two che guevara leaving his post as a <UNK> in cuba and after a failed attempt in the <UNK> only in passing mentioned in the film goes down to bolivia to try and start up another through the jungle style revolution things don't go quite as well planned at all probably because of che's then notorious stature as a communist and revolutionary and in part because of america's involvement on the side of the <UNK> government and of course that castro wasn't really around as a back up for che br br as it goes the second part of che is <UNK> but in some ways <UNK> than the first part which makes sense as guevara has to endure low <UNK> from his men <UNK> from those around him constant mistakes by <UNK> and nearby <UNK> and by ultimately the <UNK> larger military force but what's <UNK> still is that guevara no matter what won't give in one may see this as an incredible strength or a fatal flaw maybe both but it's also clear how one starts to see che if not totally more fully rounded then as something of a more sympathetic character true he did kill and executed and felt justified all the way and yet it starts to work on the viewer in the sense of a primal level of pity the sequence where <UNK> health <UNK> without medicine leading up to the shocking stabbing of a horse marks as one of the most memorable and satisfying of any film this year br br again <UNK> command of narrative is strong if on occasion slightly <UNK> understandable due to the big running time and one or two scenes just feel totally odd matt damon but these are minor <UNK> going this time for the straight color camera approach this is almost like a pure <UNK> style war picture told with a great deal of care for the men in the group as well as guevara as the lord over this group and how things <UNK> down the final scene and as always del toro is at the top of his game in every scene every beat knowing this guy so well for better and for worse that he comes about as close to <UNK> as possible overall the two parts of che make up an impressive package history as drama in compelling style good for an audience even if they don't know che or better if they don't think highly of him it's that special 8 5 10
<START> prior to seeing show people my impression of silent comedy was essentially slapstick and slapstick only i could not imagine how screen comedy could be possible without relying heavily on spoken word or numerous <UNK> but this masterful film proved me wrong davies in my view was probably the greatest comedic actress to come along prior to lucille ball i mention lucy primarily because <UNK> mannerisms and facial expressions reminded me of her to the point that i wonder if davies wasn't one of <UNK> primary influences this is coming from a 21 year old who had never before seen silent comedy and i must say that no matter how much of the period specific references you actually get i didn't apparently you will not be bored by this movie you will probably even laugh more than you would at most <UNK> comedies this is not only my favorite silent comedy but easily among my ten favorite comedies of all time
<START> though the sopranos is yet another gift from the <UNK> the godfather and sequels which <UNK> and to a certain extent <UNK> the mafia the sopranos takes another <UNK> no suited up classy <UNK> here with homes in lake <UNK> and stakes in vegas <UNK> these guys are <UNK> with a front of waste management who deal with things that fall off the back of <UNK> topless bars protection money in short what the neighborhood <UNK> were all about br br colorful characters dominate this series which doesn't hold back on the sex and graphic violence tony soprano james gandolfini is a mob head with a wife and two children living in new jersey who suffers from panic attacks as he tries to balance his <UNK> family with his mafia one to get to the bottom of his attacks he sees a psychiatrist jennifer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who is afraid of him and yet attracted to him at the same time tony's henchman paulie his nephew christopher his uncle junior the titular head of the mob his good friend <UNK> are all fully fleshed out characters br br as we learn going through the series there are enemies not only from without but from within and one of those enemies includes tony's <UNK> but horrible mother nancy <UNK> who convinces junior that tony is a danger to him tony's sister <UNK> meanwhile is searching for money in her mother's house with a <UNK> and a <UNK> counter tony has mistress problems and a wife edie <UNK> who puts up with a lot because she loves him all the while keeping ties to her catholic religion the church <UNK> on divorce she tells one woman <UNK> a split let the <UNK> live with him is the response as far as tony's mistress problems his psychiatrist points out that tony is attracted to demanding women for whom nothing is ever enough and asks him if it sounds familiar yeah it sounds like his mother br br i'm of italian descent and yes i'm sick of italians being shown in a negative light and everyone assuming all italians are <UNK> yet you can't help liking this show which is a constant reminder of our culture <UNK> it's pointed out isn't turkey and sweet <UNK> pie it's the <UNK> the <UNK> the <UNK> and <UNK> and then the bird not to mention the right on <UNK> of words like <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> etc the only un italian thing about tony is that he doesn't have a finished basement something <UNK> of in the rest of my family except my parents never had one either br br the <UNK> in this show are gandolfini as a ruthless gangster on <UNK> <UNK> who is brilliant as his wife and <UNK> as the tortured jennifer but everyone is excellent if you can take the violence and the language this is a great show an <UNK> portrait of new jersey mob life
<START> i love this film and it is such a wonderful example of a family <UNK> a romantic love story and a very sad story plot everything was just so perfect and excellent about this film it was such a great mixture of actors and actresses and with some laughs and a lot of cries this film deserves to get plenty of awards with the mention of beautiful scenario and although i would relate this film to the <UNK> and the family stone it was sort of much more cunning sad and brilliant than those films the evening tells of a love story between an old woman dreaming back to her younger years and her two daughters stay by her side while she is not well the story dating back is so strongly told and wonderful i was sitting on the edge of my seat you really get to know all the characters and by the end i was wanting to watch it all over again this is a amazingly sad and vividly acted and plotted movie that is really one of a kind and should be seen by all for how wonderful it really is all the performances are astonishing and the film captures your attention from the very beginning and never lets go i loved it and am so glad that i watched it for it was truly an astonishing film
<START> this <UNK> ann and andy movie is so adorable we love watching ann and andy sing and dance along with the <UNK> with the <UNK> knees this movie is what made the <UNK> with the <UNK> knees so popular singing his song i'm <UNK> i love you if you love <UNK> ann and andy watch the movie and you will see why it's a movie the kids love and adults
<START> this really was a waste of time the movie has a weak plot the story is <UNK> and ends very abruptly with many <UNK> though the animation is top notch br br once the movie started i tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by telling myself that it might get interesting in the later stage but it was never unique this same plot has been played over and over again but what made it worse was that the major plot hole was the whole story on how to kill the baddies the writer could have done so much more with the entire concept but seemed that he or she did not have their heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started br br overall too much hype but not able to deliver
<START> not that many films have truly exploited the fear of going to the dentist that many people have those in the profession have some genuinely <UNK> looking <UNK> give writers dennis <UNK> stuart gordon and charles <UNK> for <UNK> maximum make you <UNK> in your seat shock value from their premise br br corbin bernsen in a nicely nuanced performance is alan feinstone dedicated dentist whose train jumps off the tracks early on an <UNK> obsessive <UNK> he starts <UNK> on thoughts of <UNK> even imagining it where there isn't any and also <UNK> <UNK> with corruption of society in general having witnessed his <UNK> wife brooke linda hoffman getting it on with their pool boy he <UNK> to <UNK> her at the same time he's under pressure from a smarmy i r s agent earl <UNK> best known as dr <UNK> from the terminator franchise to do a favor in exchange for the agent keeping his mouth shut about <UNK> financial affairs feinstone starts to perceive everybody around him as <UNK> in one way or another and he goes on a murder spree as police detective <UNK> the always welcome ken <UNK> picks up his trail br br director brian <UNK> clearly has great fun with the script it allows for some genuinely nasty and remarkably entertaining gore scenes that do just as well as creating sympathy for the victims as thrilling the audience the script gives the feinstone character some fine lines of dialog and is overall quite sly and amusing with large doses of pitch black humor such as feinstone <UNK> a victim to get their tongue out of the way brooke and the i r s agent figure in particularly effective torture scenes the makeup effects are for the most part quite good and the film does a fine job of maintaining its forward momentum as feinstone with his relentless drive for perfection switches from respected professional to unhinged killer in record time br br <UNK> always cool and fun to watch is rather wasted in a standard issue detective role but there's some enjoyment in watching <UNK> play his <UNK> part to the <UNK> hoffman and <UNK> <UNK> provide very appealing eye candy and a pre fame mark <UNK> can be seen in a small supporting role but this is all very much <UNK> show as he sinks his teeth <UNK> me for using that expression into his <UNK> leading part with total conviction br br the dentist ranks as one of the more original and interesting horror films to come out of the 1990's br br 8 10
<START> old movie buffs will know why i'd call this one the man in the grey <UNK> <UNK> most bible based movies are basically schlock what might call forth smiles and <UNK> here is how peck tries to raise consciousness on a variety of psychological and social issues with the <UNK> carrying <UNK> all about him as a great romance it falls flat as <UNK> bread but there is something gripping about this movie of all the big hollywood bible pictures it most strikingly conveys the <UNK> attitude of the average american towards belief in the biblical god billy <UNK> <UNK> is <UNK> it out with h l <UNK> <UNK> all through the script who gets the better of it in the heavenly chorus backed <UNK> depends on your point of view other than that d b boasts a good performances by peck especially in the closing <UNK> scene and by <UNK> meadows as his bitter first wife <UNK> vivid moody atmosphere good idea to set most action at dawn or night and the rousing rendition of the twenty third <UNK> at the end
<START> it probably isn't fair that i have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten but oh well br br from a standpoint of acting how could any actor fail with these characters each one mesmerizing and intense in their <UNK> of life tony soprano while a mob <UNK> and suffering from mental illness still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive each of his men you see their lives virtually from the inside like the <UNK> form of <UNK> it definitely brings out a sort <UNK> side in each and every viewer and i include myself in this br br while some above don't care for <UNK> i have to say this is the <UNK> role she has had in years since good <UNK> she is the side of tony that makes him listen to reason that makes him decent that offers him <UNK> when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long if ever she is simply put his <UNK> not speaking in religious tones br br but the <UNK> performance here is without doubt edie <UNK> to see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed hbo series oz and then see her as <UNK> is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress she has <UNK> the <UNK> of a recognizable actress something only actresses like <UNK> streep can get away with a sort of <UNK> quality to <UNK> roles but as i have mentioned before with a characters a strong as these how can any actor fail br br <UNK> strength is in her daily <UNK> of faith in herself she is a survivor as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors she is prepared for the worst because she knows the <UNK> of her husband's business yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from jersey she is wise if not <UNK> and more street <UNK> then tony himself br br all in all the biggest crime from the soprano family is that we the viewer have to wait until january 2000 to see the next season this in my opinion is the worst thing about the hbo series it was what brought the larry sanders show sex and the city dream on and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them too much space in between seasons and very <UNK> until then i will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled
<START> a typical lanza flick that had limited audience appeal with a weak story line that was put together simply to justify <UNK> mgm contract at the time br br as reported by member <UNK> above grayson could not stand lanza because of his obscene advances towards her off and sometimes on camera in addition his <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> smell of alcohol in her face during scenes they did together were <UNK> after doing their second and last film together <UNK> of new orleans the normally quiet grayson <UNK> into <UNK> b <UNK> office and told him in no uncertain words that she would never work with lanza again  period <UNK> felt that grayson was much more valuable to mgm then lanza so <UNK> statement stuck grayson went on to star in a number of widely received and far more <UNK> musicals with howard <UNK> and others later in life when asked to compare lanza and <UNK> her <UNK> was that there was no comparison between them and that <UNK> was great to work with and had much more appeal to the real people in the audiences
<START> monster he was great i loved the special effects which created this monster which looked like an updated version of the creature from the black <UNK> the scenes with this beast <UNK> the land and capturing people <UNK> from good to jaw dropping br br social commentary much of the story takes place in the <UNK> area as the doctors under orders from the government state that <UNK> like disease is out there in a nutshell we get the familiar government cover up story you know i expect this liberal paranoid mindset with hollywood films always painting our government as corrupt but it looks like the <UNK> are <UNK> the format and it's very tedious in here it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this monster it just drags the film down the main family featured in the film has to watch from a distance while the young girl in their family presumed dead was <UNK> off by the creature br br moral a typical don't <UNK> the water message because this is what can happen a horrible mutated monster this used to be the anti nuclear bomb message from the 1950 when radiation caused giants ants <UNK> fish or whatever in those <UNK> sci fi films now its <UNK> issues that are the focus br br the humor this was mostly stupid i normally laugh at slapstick but this wasn't funny i don't know if the korean sense of humor is that pitiful or the film was <UNK> trying to be ultra corny with a take on the old godzilla movies let's hope it's the latter br br transfer the video transfer was good this was a sharp looking picture and sound was decent with a lot rear <UNK> crowd noise i watched this in korean with the english subtitles that might have been a mistake as the korean <UNK> voice sounds got annoying after a half hour br br overall this had a promise but turned out to be a big letdown and even boring in too many spots which is <UNK> for a modern day monster film two hours was way too long for this story how this film drew record crowds in korea i don't know they must not have much in the way of films to enjoy and support
<START> this is a bit of a first for me the first time i have ever been disappointed in a tim burton film <UNK> isn't a bad film great sets costumes and the odd great performance but it could have been made by any off the shelf hollywood director the pacing was very odd the last third was just spent waiting for the film to end by myself and the cast tim roth was excellent probably the only pleasure in the film come back tim
<START> great little thriller i was expecting some type of silly horror movie but what i got was tight short thriller that waste none of our time <UNK> these movies we have to get into the back characters stories so we will either feel sympathy for them or hatred when people start getting killed o such <UNK> here yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled we saw them so we could just how efficient the lisa character was and how <UNK> the new hotel clerk was we see the little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role later in the movie when all heck breaks loose the flight <UNK> because we need on in particular to move the plot ahead the bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight the rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too the only 2 characters that were just 5 liners with no use to the plot were the two young guys on the plane that was clever because i thought they would have something to do with plot from the first scene to the last the woman character a young hotel executive named lisa is in charge even when jackson shows his true colors she doesn't panic she thinks what she can do to <UNK> time any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots but not this one it was a very short movie and i was waiting for the usual plot devices to kick in because the movie seemed to be coming to its conclusion fast <UNK> none of them were used the new hotel clerk did not do the usual called and told her what to do which is panic drop the phone and run out of the hotel without saying anything or question your boss and tell her she had to much to drink and just dismiss her was craven should do more of these types of movies also one last comment brian cox is in the movie but i had not one clue who he was i had to come over here to see that he is <UNK> father he is completely <UNK>
<START> leonard <UNK> compared this film to a mel brooks comedy he was far too kind to ms rivers and far too cruel to mr brooks not even the <UNK> mel brooks films are this tasteless and at least they're genuinely funny this picture deserves a place on the hundred worst list
<START> if the movies are to be believed chinese ghosts are much <UNK> and more mischievous than their western counterparts the <UNK> of the three <UNK> <UNK> films are largely identical but the direction is excellent and the detail and colour is such that it's not a huge problem as always humour is an integral part of the film accompanied of course by a great deal of <UNK> for those who haven't encountered the <UNK> <UNK> trilogy yet this film offers an interesting departure from the western horror ghost genre for those who have another enjoyable romp in the chinese ghost world
<START> alright friends a serious movie buff is expected to watch all kinds of movie the bad as well as the good and this movie put me to the test i won't <UNK> words this movie was bad the story was bad the acting was bad the always wonderful sissy <UNK> did nothing to make this movie better indeed i asked myself why did i even bother to see this rotten trashy movie why did i waste my time and money on something that i suspected would be bad the answer is of course that i am a movie buff and therefore cannot avoid what otherwise should be avoided i will not waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateurish movie except to say that the quality of the acting was to put it <UNK> <UNK> a serious movie buff may want to take on the responsibility of watching this movie otherwise stay home don't waste your time read a book take take of <UNK> or have yourself a good <UNK>
<START> the film's design seems to be the <UNK> and <UNK> of some of the major issues in this country u s we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film <UNK> the obvious of student v s teacher is present but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships male v s female white v s black and the individual v s society but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v s himself br br i was amazed at how <UNK> a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus most films typically show the <UNK> of one side while showing the suffering of the other this film showed the <UNK> and suffering of both sides it did not attempt to show how either was right although i would say the skin heads were shown a much <UNK> and <UNK> quite obvious towards the end the film also <UNK> sex and rape it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together for a time lawrence fishburne does an over the top performance as the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> the idea of race <UNK> and instead shows the <UNK> of the lazy and down <UNK> with the <UNK> and positive other stars that make this film are omar <UNK> ice cube and jennifer <UNK> michael <UNK> gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance <UNK> banks make her film debut and proves <UNK> can act br br higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper in fact i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other rather than some dry book as the real education at a university it is a life learning process not a <UNK> one i think you'll find higher learning is <UNK> to the important issues at many <UNK> and even life in general 8 10
<START> the <UNK> did seem to struggle to find rolls for bo after 10 br br i used to work for a marine park in the florida keys one day the script for ghosts can't do it was <UNK> among the <UNK> in the fish house where food was prepared for the <UNK> there was one scene where a <UNK> supposedly <UNK> bo or bo the <UNK> asking to go make eggs reading the script we <UNK> br br we did not end up doing any portion of this movie at our facility although our <UNK> were in the big blue br br this must have been very close to the end of anthony <UNK> life i hope he had fun in this film as it certainly didn't do anything for his legacy
<START> unbelievably awful film i watched part of this on t v recently my jaw dropped as i watched a <UNK> conceived plot and listened to mind numbing drivel not a single line from the master of one liners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle it was so bad it made me want to <UNK> rodney <UNK> body slap him around and scream how could you i know many films are done in <UNK> hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme but please hollywood show a little respect for your audience it's sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe the bottom of the <UNK> even by sunday afternoon television standards

<START> halloween is not only the godfather of all slasher movies but the greatest horror movie ever john carpenter and debra hill created the most suspenseful creepy and terrifying movie of all time with this classic <UNK> michael myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of <UNK> such as jason <UNK> friday the 13th the <UNK> my bloody valentine and charlie <UNK> the night brings charlie okay so i got a little obscure there but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre no longer did a monster have to come from king <UNK> tomb or from dr <UNK> lab he could be created in the <UNK> little <UNK> of <UNK> and on the night he came home <UNK> <UNK> and the viewers would never be the same there are many aspects of this movie that make it the <UNK> jewel of horror movies first is the setting it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters this is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe but if trouble starts to <UNK> nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved especially when a heavy breathing madman is trying to <UNK> our young heroine along with the setting the movie takes place on halloween the scariest night of the year while most people are <UNK> jack o <UNK> michael myers is looking to <UNK> up some <UNK> <UNK> besides the setting there is some great acting jamie lee curtis does a <UNK> job as our heroine laurie <UNK> a <UNK> two shoes high <UNK> who can never seem to find a date however it is donald <UNK> as dr sam <UNK> who really steals the show his portrayal of the good doctor who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of michael myers and feels compelled to send him to hell once and for all is the stuff of horror legend however it is the <UNK> score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film once you hear it you will never forget it i also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture nowadays they seem to <UNK> up the image of every movie giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of in halloween john carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at michael myers he always seems like he is a part of the shadows and i think that is what makes him so terrifying there are many scenes where michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens <UNK> to them which adds to his creepiness if you think about some <UNK> could be watching you right now and you wouldn't even know it unfortunately for our teenagers and fortunately for us horror fans when they find michael he's not looking for candy on this halloween night he's looking for blood finally michael myers himself is a key element to this movie's <UNK> his relentless pursuit of laurie <UNK> makes him seem like the killer who will never stop he is the <UNK> that will haunt you for the rest of your life so if you have not seen this movie if there are still some of you out there who haven't or even if you have grab some popcorn turn off every light pop this into the old dvd and watch in fright trick or treat
<START> at the time of writing this review it would seem that over 50 of imdb voters had given this film a rating of either a 10 or a 1 i can only <UNK> then that those giving it a 10 were either cast or crew members br br they say that given enough monkeys and enough time and enough <UNK> those monkeys just by random <UNK> at the keyboard would eventually type out the complete works of shakespeare however i seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time you could find a single one to give this movie a rating of 10 br br i <UNK> watched the first half <UNK> assuming that the film would on some level develop either the plot or the characters or maybe make some kind of social comment or <UNK> barely intellectual thought failing that i was quite prepared to accept action suspense comedy horror or even gratuitous sex as a way of holding my attention ultimately i was disappointed and consequently much of the second half was viewed at double speed as i searched in vain for some small <UNK> of cinematic redemption sadly there was none br br if the choke was put up against an episode of scooby doo then i'm afraid the cartoon would win hands down in terms of mystery intrigue and <UNK> and speaking of cartoon characters the acting abilities of the various cast members varied between acceptable at best and embarrassingly poor with brooke <UNK> portrayal of the freaky death obsessed pseudo <UNK> london being so bad i almost felt sorry for her br br i would have liked to have finished on a positive note but even the soundtrack a second rate feast of contemporary punk rock failed even to entertain let alone serve to enhance a very poor flick
<START> i love jane <UNK> stories i've only read two of them p p and s s but after having seen this adaption i'm reaching for <UNK> from my <UNK> just to make sense out of the story and also because i <UNK> to believe jane austen could have written such nonsense for me i thought that if you base a film on a jane austen novel you can't really go wrong it will turn out great pretty much by <UNK> i was wrong br br first of all where are the characters that you <UNK> with and like you have to have at least one likable character to get the audience to <UNK> their emotions in them and this did not deliver sure i wanted anne and <UNK> to get together but only because that's what you know the purpose of the story is them getting together instead i had to resist <UNK> to throw my <UNK> at the tv and to continue watching it to the end br br anne was utterly annoying throughout and in the end i really have no idea why <UNK> was so smitten by her as there seemed to be nothing there for him to be attracted to she was meek bland dull socially <UNK> and came across like a sheep following everyone else's <UNK> rather than having a mind of her own this can still work for a lead character if you do it well this wasn't done well br br the other characters were just displaying various degrees of <UNK> of which mary was the worst with a full blown <UNK> personality disorder where mrs <UNK> in p p had similar flaws she was still endearing whereas mary was more of a freak show more <UNK> than funny br br <UNK> was very handsome and seemed like a decent kind of guy for the most part of the story i was just wondering what kind of person he was and why he's in love with anne as surely he's the kind of guy who would want a person who is a little bit more alive acting wise not too much to say as i <UNK> more to the characters being portrayed rather than how good bad the people acting were anthony head was excellent but as soon as i saw he was in it i expected no less br br also found the story very confusing it wasn't until the end of the movie where it seemed as if elizabeth was not <UNK> stepmother but in fact a sister i'm still not 100 on that the whole anne <UNK> back story was also a bit fuzzy they had been together but then broke up and they're both bitter about it how come i was wondering this for quite some time and the explanation seemed to be she dumped him because she was <UNK> to do so by someone but it was said in a kind of by the by way that it was almost missed as if it was somehow <UNK> how can it be <UNK> when it's the very core of the story there was also a lot of name dropping but no real feel for who the characters were this <UNK> person for instance who was she a friend family what it wasn't made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship with one another lady russell was there a lot but why mrs <UNK> and <UNK> were brother and sister which felt very unrealistic as mrs <UNK> looked old enough to be his mother br br the final kiss yes it was a bit strange them kissing in the street but i didn't really think about it because i was too busy yelling get on with it already at the tv because <UNK> lips <UNK> and <UNK> and <UNK> for what felt like ages before they actually met <UNK> have some <UNK> there but only for a couple of seconds or so not half a minute br br then there's the issue of camera work as a regular movie watcher you don't pay attention to angles and such unless you decide to look out for it i didn't decide to do so here but i still noticed them to me that means the filmmakers are not doing a good job a lot of conversations were with extreme facial closeups something that should only be used when there's a really important point to be made in this adaption it was over used and therefore lacked meaning the hand held feeling on occasion also didn't really work in a period drama the camera work in the running scene in the end also felt too contemporary not to mention the running itself this was the only austen adaption i caught in <UNK> austen season makes me wonder if it's worth watching <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> park or if i should just read the books and leave it at that i'm sad to say this is a jane austen adaption i did not enjoy maybe i'll watch the 1995 version instead the bbc are renowned for having done beautiful austen adaptations before after all
<START> following the appalling attack force chances were that seagal could only have a step up with flight of fury to out stink attack force would take some doing flight of fury is a marked improvement overall but still in the grand scheme of thinks mediocre mediocrity is seemingly an achievement for seagal these days a sad insight into his movie <UNK> decline where attack force was a <UNK> <UNK> of plot lines altered drastically from conception to filming to post production flight of fury keeps the plot line more simple someone steals a high tech stealth fighter planning to use it to fire chemical weapons which we later <UNK> discover will destroy the whole world in 48 <UNK> seagal has to get the plane back it's that simple no annoying sub plots and <UNK> <UNK> the film down like far too many of his recent works that's not to suddenly say the storytelling is good though it's pretty poor the introduction to side characters is badly done for example br br in <UNK> terms <UNK> is bad it's badly acted by all involved and seagal looks bored to tears almost he's just got the look of a <UNK> who's been forced to perform the school <UNK> against his will and so performs with a constant <UNK> and air of half <UNK> can we blame seagal though when the material is so un ambitious and <UNK> not really this is the final film of his <UNK> <UNK> multi picture deal the producers can't be bothered to make anything remotely good promising a 12 or so million dollar budget and after <UNK> obligatory 5 million probably <UNK> a nice <UNK> <UNK> of it themselves if the film was made for the remaining 7 million then i'm elvis <UNK> so in that respect why should seagal put the effort into a film that's already got distribution <UNK> before it's made <UNK> though may argue he at least owes them the effort he's seriously looking jaded and the continued use of stand ins and dub overs is further indication of this michael <UNK> directs with some <UNK> while the cinematography is quite good but in all technical areas and as usual with <UNK> a <UNK> standard stunt team there's nothing more than mediocrity and nothing to help the film rise above its material and bored leading man again there's a few action scenes focusing on characters other than seagal which in all truth we don't want to see br br overall the action isn't too bad it's nice and violent and on occasion we're treated to a few vintage nasty seagal <UNK> but overall nothing special partly due to a poor stunt crew and the lack of time to film anything too complex or exciting for me shadow man was a more enjoyable film because while ignoring the incoherent <UNK> plot line there were more vintage seagal moments and more of him in centre stage he never disappeared for long periods during the film seagal disappears <UNK> during one action scene here and re appears after with little explanation there's far too much stock footage used using stock shots isn't an entirely horrendous thing but using it as a <UNK> is we're treated to countless establishing shots of naval ships all the time which get annoying plus the continuity of the stock footage is all over the place just check the backdrops <UNK> and changing br br the film is just middle of the road it says it all that the films best scene is a completely needless and gratuitous girl on girl scene with two hot chicks seagal even <UNK> up briefly then too overall this may be one of the better stock footage based <UNK> out there but that's not saying much at all this will please many fans but they should bear in mind seagal himself would probably want to forget this one's existence
<START> a disappointing film br br the story established our protagonist as <UNK> a <UNK> rather <UNK> individual <UNK> not doing much actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didn't surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives it's a pity though <UNK> seem like interesting character br br story was predictable and at times felt quite <UNK> so the question now is when are we going to see the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> breaking ground with compelling <UNK> told stories that will inspire rather than entertain for the <UNK> of two hours br br technically a disgusting shot film
<START> i recently found this movie on vhs after looking for it for a number of years i was not disappointed it gets better every time i see it peter ustinov stars and co wrote the original screenplay nominated for an academy award other stars you've heard of include karl malden bob <UNK> and <UNK> romero ustinov plays an <UNK> <UNK> just released from <UNK> infamous <UNK> <UNK> prison he had <UNK> from the conservative party <UNK> selected because he is a liberal he immediately begins a search for a new <UNK> from whom he can <UNK> and discovers that computers are the wave of the future he social <UNK> his way into a london men's club and learns the identity of the best computer experts in town he steals the identity of one <UNK> smith who has just left town for south america to pursue his <UNK> of collecting <UNK> in the wild he talks his way into <UNK> can co an american <UNK> headed by <UNK> <UNK> karl malden <UNK> hires smith and shows him around the computer center especially its security feature <UNK> of a flashing blue light ustinov asks the computer how to defeat its security and the computer <UNK> tells him <UNK> blue light using <UNK> techniques from 30 years in the future ustinov breaks into the system and programs the computer to generate <UNK> written to various bogus companies the scheme starts to unravel when <UNK> assistant <UNK> g <UNK> bob <UNK> notices the amount of business <UNK> can co appears to be <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> companies with the help of his secretary patty <UNK> maggie smith ustinov manages to avoid <UNK> and lives happily ever after to tell you how would spoil this very funny romantic intelligent and ahead of its time picture
<START> it is a good film for kids who love dogs it runs a bit slow early on but ends if a <UNK> of <UNK> up de <UNK> the basic plot is the same as the first movie the bright side of the movie for adults is the talking bird that thinks it is a dog the bird talks like a human eric <UNK> of monty python and <UNK> like a dog it is the comedy that the film needed more of see it in the <UNK> so you don't have to pay full price or wait for it to appear on disney
<START> lin <UNK> james stewart wins a rifle a winchester in a shooting contest dutch henry brown stephen <UNK> is a bad loser and steals the gun lin takes his horse and goes after dutch and his men and the rifle with his buddy high spade <UNK> mitchell the rifle gets in different hands on the way will it get back to the right owner anthony mann and james stewart worked together for the first time and came up with this masterpiece winchester '73 1950 stewart is the right man to play the lead he was always the right man to do anything the terrific shelley winters plays the part of lola manners and she's great as always dan duryea is terrific at the part of <UNK> <UNK> dean charles drake is brilliant as <UNK> cowardly boyfriend steve miller also <UNK> <UNK> and bat masterson are seen in the movie and they're played by will <UNK> and steve <UNK> the young rock hudson plays young bull and the young anthony tony curtis plays <UNK> there are many classic moments in this movie in one point the group is surrounded by indians since this is a western it's great to watch this survival game where the <UNK> <UNK> and the <UNK> <UNK> is the winner all the true western fans will love this movie
<START> i have seen this movie plenty of times and i gotta tell ya i've enjoyed it every single time this is <UNK> <UNK> movie in my opinion belushi and <UNK> are so likable and <UNK> with the common man that you can't help but get involved once you start watching the movie has a wonderful cast of stars some already were big and others were just getting started it's billed as a feel good movie and that's exactly what it is this movie teaches you that life isn't always so bad after all sometimes you've just gotta look at stuff in a different perspective to fully appreciate what you already have when you're done watching you'll appreciate the things you have a lot more and you'll also be smiling you can't ask for much more from a movie in my opinion not to mention it's a hilarious movie and you'll never lose interest very very underrated movie here folks br br rating from me 10 i am out
<START> i don't know why but for some sick reason i think since i've been on the disney sequel <UNK> i decided to just go ahead and see <UNK> <UNK> the first movie that was a remake of the disney cartoon classic starring glenn close as cruella de <UNK> it seemed like a sure hit but it was just a bomb i think the reason why these movies don't work is because 101 <UNK> the original was a cartoon it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults this was not really that fun because it's adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings i understand they're trying to make sure that it's appealing to the kids but it's <UNK> to see the way these actors are behaving in the film and <UNK> <UNK> story isn't really that good br br cruella de <UNK> has been in prison for a while but things change when she is proved that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being but her reputation is now damaged as a puppy <UNK> but she buys a man's dog shelter and is all of a sudden is being loved by everyone and it looks like she's changed but when she sees her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> she goes crazy and starts seeing spots and she <UNK> it she's back for revenge on <UNK> and is still determined to get that <UNK> coat she's always wanted br br glenn close is such an amazing actress very under rated but her taking on cruella de <UNK> she's good but let's face it this movie made the fun villain just more of a silly nut case also as cute as the <UNK> were it just works more for the animation it sounds stupid but it's just not as believable without the cartoon and their personalities being in the mix i wouldn't really recommend <UNK> <UNK> it's alright but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time this is just the same thing br br 2 10
<START> i watched scarecrows because of the buzz surrounding it well i can't imagine anyone liking this movie because it's just bad bad bad br br it's obvious that whoever made this movie doesn't know a single thing about horror the whole story is an <UNK> marriage of two genres action movie guns and criminals and horror living scarecrows when the criminals are killed one by one by the <UNK> looking scarecrows the two genres automatically <UNK> each other out because first they're criminals and who cares about criminals and second because they're stupid criminals to boot having zombie scarecrows go after them just doesn't work here where's the horror in that i wanted the criminals to die horrible painful deaths br br but the story is so badly constructed that this marriage of genres which could have been original if handle well never <UNK> we're simply left with is a bunch of super dense criminals and a bunch of scarecrows which are alive for whatever flimsy reason the filmmakers thought up making things even worse is the fact that the cinematography is terrible tv like and worse offense of all whole <UNK> of the dialogue are told on cbs and we continuously hear inane dialogue spoken over <UNK> images as if we're watching some sort of radio show this part was really bad the director should have been shot on the spot for coming up with such a stupid idea i can't tell you how annoying that was br br as i've already mentioned the criminals in scarecrows are amazingly stupid for instance when someone suddenly shows up <UNK> and filled with money and straw yep straw in his huge open wound the others ask what drug is he on after they shoot tons of bullets in him unable to kill him he's been <UNK> by the scarecrows don't ask get a freaking clue morons i've never seen such stupid people in a movie and then there's the girl i wished one of the scarecrows had killed her quickly because she was a pain in the butt when she finds her father nailed to a scarecrow cross she actually blames the criminals in an embarrassing scene bad acting even though the criminals couldn't have done it what a <UNK> she was but the scarecrows are the biggest weakness in this very weak flick they're not scary nothing much is explained about them they're just a plot device in this plot device filled movie br br mr wesley filming the face of a scarecrow for 30 seconds <UNK> doesn't <UNK> anything but sheer boredom and that scene with the talking head in the <UNK> thanks for the laughter br br all in all this had to be one of the worst movies i've seen recently and i've seen a lot of movies these days between the equally <UNK> <UNK> killer or scarecrows i'd rather watcher <UNK> killer again yep scarecrows is that bad
<START> if you have read the books then forget the characters that <UNK> built in your head the representation of <UNK> <UNK> etc have had the <UNK> treatment the dark riders are excellent and as i had always imagined from the books br br <UNK> this is an excellent film mixing live motion and animation to produce amazing effects for the year i only wish he bakshi had been given the money to complete his epic br br it's worth having the video as they will be worth a bit after the 2001 lord of the rings
<START> just a note to add to the above comment fear of a black hat doesn't have the criminal who's image has been ripped off by the band that's in <UNK> easily confused as the two films are so similar but black hat is vastly the superior of the two yeah
<START> the 40 year old virgin exists in a world i don't understand a world where an <UNK> store employee can tell his boss to f off and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get <UNK> a world where it's really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other <UNK> cars a world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually <UNK> her <UNK> a world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic <UNK> and a world without any funny jokes i am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie i thought every scene was like a bad saturday night live sketch not very funny to begin with and stretched out beyond all rational thought the chest <UNK> scene went on forever br br the characters aside from carell were totally one note and the romantic elements were completely contrived particularly the scene where <UNK> finds porn in <UNK> apartment that was just lame br br and i also found the <UNK> sequence totally annoying and excessive i hated hated hated this movie
<START> my first exposure to the <UNK> not a good one i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video which has brought us other cult classics such as spider baby the print quality is excellent but this alone can't hide the fact that the film is deadly dull there's a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the <UNK> set the whole thing in motion but everything else in the movie is slow <UNK> ultimately <UNK> adding insult to injury the movie was dubbed not subtitled as promised on the video jacket
<START> caught the tail end of this movie channel surfing through the cable movie channels and was so intrigued i sought out the next showing br br i really didn't know what to expect after reading the program summary but i came away from this movie feeling quite disturbed and <UNK> it also gave me as adult who attended high school in the 80's a little better insight into what our kids have to <UNK> with these days br br the fact that you don't see the shooting only adds to the <UNK> of the plot to see both child and adult alike struggle to comprehend and come to terms with the senseless shootings was at times overwhelming and will admit that i shed quite a few tears throughout br br on the whole not a movie that i would seek out to what however i am sure glad i did see it
<START> this is one of the first and best <UNK> starring robert <UNK> and ray <UNK> robert <UNK> appeared on another columbo as did several other villains including patrick <UNK> william shatner and jack cassidy ray <UNK> also made a later appearance br br in this one ray <UNK> is convinced his beautiful wife played by patricia <UNK> is having an affair so he hires <UNK> to investigate <UNK> has a <UNK> business on the side so he gives <UNK> a fake report and threatens <UNK> with the real one if she doesn't pay up they get into a huge fight in <UNK> home and she winds up murdered enter columbo br br <UNK> does everything he can to get columbo off the case including offering him a job but columbo is on to him from the beginning br br excellent episode
<START> if you have any sort of appreciation for character and dialogue and any sense of american cultural history you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film it probably was originally a play and that's why it's dialogue heavy but i can't stress enough how these icons that we only have a shallow understand of are made into truly complex and wonderful characters br br this film is better than any college course for telling you how to create a character driven story br br
<START> i just got the uk 4 disc special edition of superman 1 for about 5 the additional stuff includes the 1951 feature superman and the mole men so i slapped it into the dvd player last night and here are my <UNK> br br some initial disappointment i hadn't checked and i think i had it mentally <UNK> as one of the kirk <UNK> serials i'm not a huge fan of george reeves as superman and i hadn't seen anything other than the odd clip of kirk <UNK> but hey ho never mind br br this black and white production runs for less than an hour it has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of <UNK> early tv series a two <UNK> put together for cinema release although imdb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first tv series in any event it's an odd choice for reasons i'll get to later i'm of an age where i recall tv and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets so there were no major surprises here even so for a low budget movie this one is really low budget br br the story concerns the small town of <UNK> population 1 <UNK> which <UNK> is also home to the world's deepest oil well 6 miles the story opens with the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> taking steps to close the well down this conflicts with the arrival of metropolis <UNK> kent and lane to report on the well at the <UNK> of the oil company as clark is <UNK> out the fact that the <UNK> has emerged into a <UNK> <UNK> 6 miles down a couple of odd little guys small in stature big in head black in <UNK> and <UNK> in <UNK> emerge from the <UNK> off <UNK> and start <UNK> round town with puzzled expressions on their faces br br a deep breath now here is the remaining plot of the picture the little guys scare some kids so jeff corey playing the town's rampant <UNK> <UNK> some pals to kill these creatures superman steps in moderately <UNK> and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital <UNK> pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed but he escapes and legs it down the <UNK> corey <UNK> a lynch mob despite the sheriff <UNK> him to hang the <UNK> mole man superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured <UNK> to the <UNK> to return him to his <UNK> a total of 4 mole men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at jeff corey i call this an <UNK> gun because its sole effect seems to be to make corey go <UNK> and superman saves him he immediately changes his ways because of <UNK> at superman saving him after the way he has <UNK> the mole men go back down the <UNK> the end br br despite the film only being an hour long there is an <UNK> amount of <UNK> around <UNK> and pursuing i have left out all the mole man 1 creeps from a to b looking out to make sure no one is following him stuff the mole men are never engaged in any way whatsoever they have no dialogue they just turn up get <UNK> and go back they do look a little creepy but they are hardly the bug eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies br br reeves is quite a good clark kent very much a hard <UNK> reporter much more so than <UNK> <UNK> rather indifferent lois lane but he is a terrible terrible superman not only does he not look the part at least his hair is <UNK> black in this which is an improvement from the rather light hair he <UNK> in some of the tv episodes the way he plays it is all wrong in my book i'm sure he was told to strike the pose which superman does constantly but someone should have told him that it should be <UNK> on <UNK> not <UNK> on <UNK> and he plays superman as a rather strict and <UNK> <UNK> he doesn't actually <UNK> his finger in <UNK> but he may as well have done br br and superman does a huge amount of walking around i say a huge amount he isn't actually in it all that much and a bit of running he takes off and lands a couple of times but isn't seen in flight at any point oh some bullets <UNK> off him and he uses <UNK> vision as clark but with no accompanying visual effect in fact visual effects are <UNK> by their absence and the few which are present aren't very good br br i've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time but even by those standards i think it's a pretty <UNK> effort thankfully production standards on the tv series were higher and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them br br something of a disappointment i <UNK> be watching it again
<START> one of john's funniest eugene levy is great in this one as well just wish the studio would figure out that this one needs to be on dvd i have it on video tape but feel that this film deserves dvd and extras would be great the kung fu <UNK> kung fu u skit is so very funny as is the entire film also the scenes he has with his girlfriend and her family are great this movie never seems to be on tv but it loses most of it's hilarity when edited for broadcast tv if you can find the video i would suggest you buy it ebay is a good place to find a copy i will keep my vhs until one day we get to see it on dvd there are so many great movies out there that still have not been released to dvd and this is one of them
<START> honestly i don't know what's funnier this horrific remake or the comments on this board <UNK> review had me in tears that's so funny anyway this movie is the among the worst movies ever and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels the omen name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on hbo but it's a slap in the face to the other three especially the original there are so many <UNK> bad moments but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the <UNK> at the psychic fair good times this movie is to the omen series what scary movie is to the entire genre avoid unless you're looking for a good laugh
<START> although it was released way back in 1967 in cold blood still remains the <UNK> by which all true crime films are matched veteran writer director richard brooks elmer <UNK> adapted truman <UNK> non fiction book into a chilling <UNK> that <UNK> a disturbing power even today thirty five years later br br robert blake and scott wilson portray perry smith and dick <UNK> two ex cons who on a tip from <UNK> old <UNK> <UNK> wells broke into the <UNK> kansas home of herbert clutter looking for a wall safe supposedly containing 10 000 but no safe was ever found and the two men instead wound up killing mr clutter his wife and their two children getting away with only a radio a pair of <UNK> and a lousy forty dollars two months on the run including an <UNK> vacation in northern mexico ended in las vegas when cops caught them in a stolen car but it eventually comes out after <UNK> <UNK> by kansas law <UNK> officials that these two men committed that <UNK> crime in <UNK> tried and convicted on four counts of murder they <UNK> in jail over a five year period of appeals and <UNK> until both are <UNK> to death on april 14 1965 br br blake and smith are absolutely chilling as the two <UNK> killers who show no <UNK> for what they've done but are concerned about getting caught john forsythe also does a good turn as alvin <UNK> the chief detective investigating the crime as does <UNK> s <UNK> as his assistant in a <UNK> that is both faithful to <UNK> book and a good artistic <UNK> all around brooks does not show the murders at the beginning instead he shows the two killers pulling up to the clutter house as the last light goes out then cuts to the next morning and the horrifying discovery of the bodies only during the ride back to kansas when blake is <UNK> by forsythe and <UNK> the story do we see the true horror of what happened that night we don't see that much blood being <UNK> in these scenes but we don't need to the shotgun <UNK> and the horrified look on the <UNK> faces as they know they are about to die are more than disturbing enough so there is no need to resort to <UNK> bloody slasher film violence br br brooks wisely filmed in cold blood in stark black and white and the results are excellent thanks to conrad <UNK> expertise the chilling jazz score by <UNK> jones is the <UNK> the end result is one of the most unsettling films of any kind ever made devastating in its own low key fashion it is a <UNK> minute study of a crime that <UNK> an entire state and indeed an entire nation and should be seen though viewer <UNK> is advised the <UNK> rating is there for a reason
<START> when one thinks of 1950s science fiction films one thinks of the sort of <UNK> black and white b films that were <UNK> on the old mystery science theater 3000 television show yet while there were far more films like plan 9 from outer space and robot monster than good films the 1950s did have some very good if not great science fiction films like the day the earth stood still the incredible <UNK> man invasion of the body <UNK> war of the worlds and the thing from another world yet the best of the bunch for its <UNK> and production values was undoubtedly <UNK> first big <UNK> into a level science fiction forbidden planet released in 1956 it was a 98 minute color film directed by fred m <UNK> that featured then state of the art special effects and was <UNK> with a very good screenplay by <UNK> <UNK> from a screen treatment called fatal planet by irving block and allen <UNK> who adapted aspects of william shakespeare's the <UNK> into it br br the film drew <UNK> when it was released for its oscar nominated special effects its all electronic music score by louis and <UNK> <UNK> although credited as electronic <UNK> to avoid music <UNK> <UNK> vivid <UNK> paintings inspired by <UNK> <UNK> and the famed monster of the id <UNK> which was animated by an animator joshua <UNK> on <UNK> from the walt disney studio even more famous was the appearance of <UNK> the robot in his first role in either film or television later he would appear in the film the invisible boy included in this dvd as a bonus as well as several appearances in the 1960s sci fi tv shows the twilight zone night gallery and lost in space with whose own robot he is often confused and a cameo appearance in the 1984 film <UNK> br br the tale is simple but <UNK> constructed and filled with humorous <UNK> that <UNK> the forced <UNK> <UNK> aspect in the film in the <UNK> century the united planets <UNK> c <UNK> a flying <UNK> led by commander j j adams leslie <UNK> yes he was once a leading man type before his police squad days is en route to the planet <UNK> iv to investigate what happened to the crew of the <UNK> sent to the planet twenty years earlier after a year's journey there they encounter the lone survivor of the party doctor edward <UNK> walter <UNK> the <UNK> stand in a <UNK> his gorgeous blond daughter <UNK> anne francis the miranda character in a pre 1960s <UNK> and <UNK> the robot the domestic servant who is the <UNK> counterpart <UNK> warns the crew of a mysterious force that killed the <UNK> party in their first year yet he was <UNK> to <UNK> all in all it's a technically good film especially with some rear <UNK> and <UNK> paintings and the absurdity of the adult reactions to <UNK> and <UNK> exploits borders an <UNK> surreal absurdity yet it's <UNK> that the filmmakers had no sense of the sublime absurdity the film <UNK> for it's played straight thus making it even funnier as for the main feature forbidden planet deserves all its kudos it's not a perfect film but it's a great way to spend a couple of hours and far better than star wars which although made twenty years later seems much more outdated and juvenile only such films like 2001 a space odyssey <UNK> alien and aliens and the first two terminator films have really <UNK> or <UNK> this classic in depth and effects br br it's worth knowing that despite forbidden <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> there is the possibility that the <UNK> is still <UNK> within <UNK> as well after all she is her father's daughter and had an even more vivid nightmare than her father when the <UNK> attacked the ship a second time also the film wisely only <UNK> the <UNK> once and never shows the <UNK> for the imagination can always <UNK> greater scares than the best special effects the film also makes good use of narrative <UNK> to <UNK> the tale something that far more realistic art films often fail to do forbidden planet is one of those rare films that both <UNK> yet <UNK> its era unlike other sci fi films which were rather obvious cold war <UNK> watch it and you will agree as well as sleep a little less easy but even if you don't there's still the scene of anne francis <UNK> that alone is timeless
<START> this was a fairly creepy movie i found the music to be effective for this the photographs mario took of the village were also unnerving however i had three problems with this film one is that the lighting was very dark so some of the time it was hard to tell what was going on but this may have just been my copy the second is that the very beginning is not explained very well and i'm still not sure what was going on there the third problem is that i didn't understand the ending but apparently some people do of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things and the male lead is very 70s all in all watchable but not even close to being a favorite
<START> we showed this movie at the local film society and the art house crowd had the time of their cinematic lives it's tasteless <UNK> and very funny in a sixties kind of way the <UNK> kitchen recipe sketch had them laughing like <UNK> the rest is a mixed bag but the <UNK> definitely beat the <UNK> by the way whatever happened to ken <UNK>
<START> let me start off by saying that this doesn't seem or feel like a movie it seems like just another tv show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it up br br the camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told the <UNK> way possible never making the public connect with it this film takes us to where no movie i've seen has done before to a realm where the film theater becomes a warm medium giving the public every element of interpretation too obvious the large movie screen is only used as an <UNK> tv from where we can see every <UNK> of these women in a larger than life manner br br lately it seems that young directors are <UNK> the art of film making for sales this is very scary the industry is spoiling the art in movies we must <UNK> ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language are really about not just sales and entertainment but a way to communicate feelings passions and even culture not as a <UNK> platform for young <UNK> and <UNK>
<START> <UNK> to heaven is a outstanding invention of movie making probably never <UNK> i rank it with the wizard of oz and african queen although it is a totally different type of movie than african queen <UNK> to heaven is a psycho drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that to my knowledge are totally unique br br for example there is the combination of b w and color footage as in oz but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple but beautiful effect achieved in oz in <UNK> the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful br br another brilliant aspect of <UNK> is the concept of time and how it is used here how could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still  literally and then there is the <UNK> itself br br if you have any imagination at all you will agree with me <UNK> to heaven is a true gem
<START> though this movie is cheesiness at its best it is pulled off perfectly this movie without a doubt has to be considered a modern classic there are basically two kinds of movies i like movies with depth chick flicks if you must i blame my wife for this and mindless comedies where i can sit back and relax this movie is a perfect example of the latter br br a friend of mine turned me on to this movie shortly after its release considering me to somewhat shallow he said to me you've got to see this movie it's just your type of movie <UNK> the insult i started watching i know they mentioned the ramones a million times but when you actually see them i said hey it is the ramones my friend <UNK> i don't know they were a real band i had my moment of glory br br this movie though now somewhat dated is a must see for ramones fans or anyone else for that matter
<START> i don't see how you can say that freddy's nightmares is cheesy and a rip off you obviously don't know good tv when you see it the episodes are packed with drama and blood freddy is creative in the way he kills people i love freddy's nightmares and i hope to get all <UNK> episodes on dvd the best episodes are saturday night special school <UNK> and love stinks if you think this series sucked then you're entitled to your opinion but remember it's only your opinion and it means nothing freddy's nightmares will always be one of the best series ever and you'll come to accept that fact soon enough if you don't like it then don't watch it but don't deny it's brilliance
<START> i really liked the movie i remember reading it several times as a kid and was glad to see a movie had been made about the book br br i was kid sitting for a boy and a girl ages 11 and 8 and had to talk the girl in to seeing the movie but happily at the end she was glad she saw it and even said that she wanted to buy it on dvd as soon as it came out br br there were some great laugh out loud moments and the movie was not as gross as i expected it would be tho it did rank pretty high up there on the gross o <UNK> br br the only thing i cannot figure out is why they had to have the <UNK> line in there that was done by woody in reference to his private part that to me was the only shocker moment and you could hear the adults in the audience <UNK> gasp at that moment in the movie i have no clue why that was put in the movie it added nothing to the actual movie except for that shock gasp factor other than that a pretty good movie nice to see the <UNK> girl all grown up
<START> in the glory days of the 90s god rest its soul you could turn on the great comedy central at any hour of the day and see the greatest sketch comedy show of all time saturday night live <UNK> a glorious show that was whether it was the original not ready for <UNK> players or the second golden age of snl featuring the <UNK> chris <UNK> adam sandler david spade and then it all went to hell i was first exposed to <UNK> about a year and a half ago and i think i must've passed out from shock how could a show so terrible <UNK> for so long there are so many horrible flaws i suppose i'll start with the writing the writing for most part is terrible it is nothing more than <UNK> bathroom humor the cast for the most part is talentless there are a few sketches i have enjoyed such as some of ms <UNK> and stuart and there are a few talents on the show such as the magnificent alex <UNK> phil <UNK> is a talented actor just not as a comedian although there a few sparse ha ha moments they are not enough to redeem this endless line of horrible drivel populated by <UNK> idiots miss this one
<START> frankly i'm rather <UNK> that on the basis of the dazzling reviews attributed to steven smith i wasted nearly two hours on his debut offering have they all been written by his pals the action <UNK> along the music is irritating and over used the script is simply dire and the actors with the exception of the <UNK> mediocre at best i do think we should support the efforts of a young filmmaker but saying it's brilliant when it's not will surely only encourage him to make the same mistakes again i e continuing to write his own scripts and using the same actors for another venture yes it's his first film low budget etc i get it but it's also out there for members of the public to purchase and it's just not up to scratch
<START> i initially bought this dvd because it had <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> on the cover and i thought hey another film starring <UNK> and shah rukh little did i know that <UNK> would only appear in an item number in the last quarter of the film in a song which she shares with <UNK> and helps introduce his character who is in the film for about just 15 minutes <UNK> is a film about a mother's love and <UNK> it's a film about <UNK> ignorance coming of age stepping into the know and <UNK> the harsh realities of life the item number in which <UNK> and <UNK> appear in has nothing to do with the movie it's actually a dream sequence that occurs while <UNK> drunken character is knocked unconscious by booze he dreams that <UNK> <UNK> is this sexy street girl who shows up at his favourite <UNK> spot one day dressed scantily and begins to seduce him the title of the song is <UNK> <UNK> loosely translated as <UNK> a bitch and it is just plain smoking hot don't miss it
<START> as for many on here i can't help but praise the cast and crew who developed <UNK> and others they made throughout my childhood i as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters br br to class this work of art as a cartoon could never do <UNK> justice in fact it's an insult to class it as a cartoon <UNK> is an animation and nothing less it is evidently the greatest work of genius to be produced at disney to date when disney pulled it from the air little did they realise what they did and i'm sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since br br i'll take a moment to explain from the first which is <UNK> to the last which i think is <UNK> duck disney has been plagued with failures due to political correctness and have taken a quantum leap backwards since they prefer <UNK> over quality now not to mention the room full of <UNK> for the story's i couldn't have my children watching the mind numbing cartoons they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer simpson some time in the future and 50 of the blame would be on me for <UNK> them to watch it i couldn't let that happen which is why i have all of the shows from the late 80's to the mid 90's on a <UNK> so one day my children couldn't be <UNK> by the cartoon crap of today and to <UNK> the last piece of childhood i have and to hold on to and i owe that all to <UNK> br br <UNK> to me is without a doubt the best animation ever produced in the world on account of it's depth charm wit compassion emotion and lack of truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today do you see any of that content in say ed <UNK> and eddie or anything else you can think of the rubbish produced today can be <UNK> to some 3 year <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> depicting a <UNK> br br the next time you watch an episode of <UNK> take a look at the <UNK> on any wooden object or building such as higher for hire and <UNK> over the quality of <UNK> and effort put into this animation even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again the buildings look true to the art <UNK> movement which was popular in the time period depicted even the vehicles are true to life ok not all of the episodes were fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it <UNK> it all out by the end of the episode and you'd probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detail br br the one thing i love about this is what i like to call the deliberate mistakes or intended mistakes in each episode and some have two for example in <UNK> deep where rebecca <UNK> you're up to something <UNK> and <UNK> replies who me i'm as innocent as a <UNK> take a look into <UNK> eyes i won't spoil the rest of the <UNK> but just keep an eye out next time br br everyone <UNK> <UNK> are bang on and 100 correct i have nothing else to add that others haven't said already on here disney wake up and smell the coffee you have been asleep for over a decade stop producing rubbish and bring back quality into animations and stop producing cartoons we have seen the proof of what you can do and we want it back as rapidly as possible
<START> if in the 90's you're adapting a book written in the 50's set the bloody thing in the 50's and not the <UNK> see 40 year old <UNK> and values tend not to play as well or ring as true that far down the road it's a simple rule that hollywood <UNK> keeps <UNK> and that's the problem with this film it should have been set in the era it was written in you'd think that would be a no <UNK> but <UNK> i'd elaborate but <UNK> comment spells it out quite well i'll limit my commentary to rachel ward she looks like she <UNK> her ass completely out of existence for this role as a result she looks like a crack <UNK> on <UNK> and is about as sexy as a gay leather couch in drag i found her i could die at any moment look quite <UNK> and it greatly <UNK> from her supposed <UNK> and the sexual tension the film intended to create other than that the film was quite good a 7 out of 10
<START> the christmas secret was <UNK> as a wonderful film but i was truly disappointed they even sold vhs and dvd copies of the film when it was over which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project as a screen actor myself i felt most of the performances were <UNK> in although beau bridges as nick did have a moment or two if i were richard thomas i would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume it was an embarrassment i had been a fan since his <UNK> days but have found myself <UNK> to watch any of his subsequent work so poor was this offering br br in <UNK> of the actors the directing was stilted mechanical and thoroughly amateurish br br i hope this is not considered a <UNK> review and negative <UNK> made about my <UNK> as a critic i turned the movie on because it had a good cast and i was prepared to enjoy the film however i would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back even though it was on t v
<START> i am stunned to discover the amount of fans this show has haven't said that friends was at best an <UNK> sitcom and not as great as others have made out let's face it if it wasn't for the casting of <UNK> cox arquette david <UNK> matthew perry lisa <UNK> jennifer aniston and matt le <UNK> then who knows whether this show would've lasted as long as it has done i very much doubt that although as the series progressed friends got more <UNK> predictable lame and boring that i couldn't care less about the characters of whom are the most overrated in tv history or of their plight nor of who was sleeping with whom and it went from being funny in the first four seasons to occasionally funny and even when it had all these a list hollywood actors from the movie world i still didn't bother to tune in the writing in friends became stale that i lost interest in this show from the sixth season <UNK> and as for the ending well it was predictable to say the least br br what was annoying though was that this lasted for ten seasons whilst some of my favourite shows lasted for only three four seasons for instance and were eventually cancelled and taken off the air for good the show should've came to an immediate halt by the time the cast wanted bigger <UNK> in truth as much as the series <UNK> it was the show that was bigger than the actors themselves not the other way round br br when it ended in 2004 i was so <UNK> to see the back of this sitcom now there is talk of a friends reunion show coming to our tv screens very soon and yet i for one will not be looking forward to it whatsoever
<START> this is one of the worst films ever i like cheesy movies but this is simply awful where are the images in the film that are on the box i think more money was spent on the dvd box <UNK> than on the entire film br br why would a company release a dvd that the cover is so misleading i feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box as much as i explore imdb i should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store i have no one to blame except myself i want my money and time back br br do not watch this movie br br even if curiosity is <UNK> you stick cocktail <UNK> in your eyes instead it will be much more enjoyable you have been warned
<START> first let me say that before sunrise like all movies is not a movie for all tastes it appears some folks are less smart to acknowledge this fact but it is remarkable to contemplate the kind of outright dislike this small harmless movie <UNK> from some people for me like most folks here before sunrise struck a deep <UNK> in me i was truly stunned moved inspired by it this is a movie that ultimately benefits from more than one viewing it creates some of the most <UNK> unforgettable feelings and emotions you can possibly imagine it is impossible to imagine this world without ever thinking about the kind of inspirational feelings i got from it br br the movie works as a <UNK> of two fragile souls that are starting to get to know each other it is very intelligent and inspiring not so much in how one conversation necessarily ties into the next or the significance of the topics of jesse and <UNK> discussions but rather the little nuances the perfectly <UNK> <UNK> they <UNK> from each other it captures an honest romantic yet fleeting human emotion that is starting to <UNK> in the <UNK> sublime <UNK> <UNK> it convinces us that their <UNK> relationship might be the greatest compliment in the world and what happens after that night is open for debate but i never doubt that they won't each other again br br the <UNK> comments by <UNK> and the below user are hopeless examples of a <UNK> <UNK> unwilling to accept and respect those who love this movie br br see it and it may change your way of life
<START> attention spoilers br br first of all let me say that rob roy is one of the best films of the 90's it was an amazing achievement for all those involved especially the acting of liam neeson jessica lange john hurt brian cox and tim roth michael <UNK> jones painted a wonderful portrait of the honor and <UNK> that men can represent in themselves but alas br br it constantly and unfairly gets compared to braveheart these are two entirely different films probably only similar in the fact that they are both about <UNK> in historical scotland yet this comparison frequently bothers me because it seems to be almost assumed that braveheart is a better film than rob roy i like braveheart a lot but the idea of comparing it to rob roy is a little insulting to me to put quite simply i love braveheart but it is a pale shadow to how much i love rob roy here are my particular reasons br br rob roy is about real people br br let's face it the william wallace in braveheart is not a real person he's a legend a <UNK> a larger than life <UNK> because of this depiction he is also a perfect person never doing wrong and basically showing his <UNK> <UNK> to the promised land when he finally does fail it is not to his fault like jesus he is betrayed by the very people he trusted most he even goes through the worst kind of torture because he wants freedom so much br br the depiction of wallace is very well done and effective but it really doesn't inspire or intrigue me i find human ambiguity far more <UNK> than human perfection that is why the last temptation of christ is a better film than king of kings and that is also one of the reasons why i think rob roy is better than braveheart rob roy may be heroic and brave but he is far from perfect he makes several mistakes that affected the lives of many of his loved ones now sure not bearing false claim against the duke of <UNK> was an act of <UNK> and courage but it was also an act of <UNK> and self <UNK> let us not forget that the <UNK> that he had claimed to protect were driven homeless by the end of the film because of this act but rob did the best he could and that was all you could ask of him br br <UNK> wife mary is also a normal <UNK> person let us start though with how she looks in this film sure she's beautiful but she doesn't wear makeup and she basically allows her natural beauty to show compare this with the two loves or one depending on your point of view of william wallace in braveheart now these two ladies are hot but hardly <UNK> of how women looked at the time especially the lay persons maybe not a fair comparison but just another example of how rob <UNK> attempts for accuracy are far more effective br br throughout rob roy mary has to live with her vicious rape by the <UNK> <UNK> cunningham she feels compelled to tell rob of her struggle but doesn't because she knows that rob must seek revenge for her rape such revenge would surely mean the death of rob and mary is not prepared for such a sacrifice br br the villains in rob roy are equally as compelling although the enemies in braveheart are well written they are hardly original robert the bruce a man both brave and cowardly is plagued by moral decisions that are all to <UNK> in the fictional realm should he take his claim as the king of scotland or should he <UNK> wallace in order to ensure the safety of his family name bruce is the most <UNK> character in braveheart but from <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> in the godfather part ii these types of characters are hardly original <UNK> although a compelling villain in his own right is very one dimensional he is the <UNK> of evil and his <UNK> ways stand in direct contrast to <UNK> <UNK> br br rob roy has three villains that are wonderful in their <UNK> first of all let's start with marquis of <UNK> he is a man who is so obsessed with his self image that he's willing to let an innocent man suffer because of it see to it that i am not <UNK> are his favorite words to his factor he is a man obsessed with power upset that a man of great noble bearing as the duke of <UNK> can be considered of greater <UNK> then him he is <UNK> self obsessed and insecure he is an evil aristocrat but in ways that make him unique br br cunningham and <UNK> are the <UNK> in rob roy and are also <UNK> direct <UNK> <UNK> is so cunning in his <UNK> that he is almost comical he will do anything to maintain the good will of the marquis which includes <UNK> and <UNK> cunningham is a compelling character in that he seems to have been raised to do whatever he can to obtain status and the affection of the marquis he needs a father little does he know that the marquis is his real father therefore when the opportunity to obtain wealth comes from <UNK> he grabs it without even questioning it he is very much like the evil of modern man so self centered and vain that he cares not about the consequences of his actions on others br br many have criticized tim <UNK> performance in this film as overacting <UNK> i say it is clear that cunningham is not simply evil but also psychopath throughout the film in a world where a man and his <UNK> can go around shooting random people for amusement is cunningham too much of an unbelievable character we live in a society where people seem to have <UNK> the value of human life rob roy simply teaches us that only the circumstances of this <UNK> value has changed it is a problem throughout human history that the vanity of the human heart will not allow for the capacity for compassion rob roy and mary give us hope that goodness will <UNK> but snakes will always exist in our world br br another character that i find fascinating is the duke of <UNK> he is a true <UNK> and his values of honesty and courtesy are in direct contrast to the marquis he <UNK> the bravery of rob roy and mary and has a direct <UNK> for the marquis and his factor he gives the world hope for the people of power hopefully people like the marquis are an exception and not the rule br br the final duel in rob roy is more exciting then 10 of the battle scenes in braveheart br br one thing i get tired of is people telling me that braveheart is a better film because of the battle scenes first of all battle scenes are hardly original from <UNK> to gladiator hollywood has had a long tradition of historical european battle scenes braveheart has some of the best battle scenes ever put on film but they suffer from one important problem these battle scenes have no context except for the fight for freedom br br now don't get me wrong <UNK> are hardly original either in fact there are probably 10 times as many films with <UNK> as there are with battle scenes but the context of the duel between cunningham and rob roy is a beauty to behold it is one of the greatest scenes in film history let me explain why br br first of all the fighting style and the bearing of the two characters in this duel describe the characters perfectly cunningham is <UNK> and dangerous rob roy is strong and courageous cunningham uses a <UNK> sword while rob uses a <UNK> cunningham fights with quick <UNK> movements while <UNK> fighting style is more obvious br br the whole film from the deliberately slow first half to the exciting second half is leading up to this moment it is powerful stuff and it is clear that rob must <UNK> this menacing evil that has plagued his whole world when rob finally gets the upper hand literally and <UNK> it is one of the greatest moments in film history rob wins because he has more to live for and his honor is more powerful than 10 <UNK> the use of music is absolutely chilling in this scene good <UNK> against a real evil is more powerful to me than seeing a dude get <UNK> just so he can yell freedom but hey maybe that's just me br br rob roy is more realistic than braveheart br br i don't know that people in the <UNK> or <UNK> talked like the people in rob roy but i do feel that it clearly an attempt to capture their speech <UNK> i feel that many people are bored by rob roy simply because they can't understand what the characters are saying if this is the case then read some <UNK> or put on the close <UNK> rob roy is actually one of the greatest written films of the 90's many of the dialogue in this film is clever but maybe you have to watch the film a couple of times to understand it br br by contrast the dialogue in braveheart is hardly very interesting of course what do you expect when the main character is a <UNK> played by an australian this is a legend and there was clearly not an attempt to capture the speech of the times this film takes place several centuries before rob roy and yet they talk like the people today thus the reason that many people like it better audiences today have become increasingly lazy and they don't want to take the time or patience to understand things that are complex therefore as with many epic films they expect to see the <UNK> speak a recognizable english accent while the heroes speak in a <UNK> not too far away from our american language sure it is clear that the wallace is <UNK> but other than sounding like <UNK> from star trek and a couple of <UNK> s for <UNK> the <UNK> in this film fit into the hollywood tradition of how we believe <UNK> should sound br br so do these <UNK> prove that rob roy is a better film than braveheart hardly but if it proves one thing it shows that it is hardly common knowledge that braveheart is a better film than rob roy to put simply rob roy is a film that has themes that are very <UNK> in today's world braveheart is a film about a legend that is inspiring but hardly realistic you can make a decision on what you think is better br br grade a score 9

<START> ok even if you can't stand <UNK> this movie is truly hilarious the scenes with john gielgud make up for <UNK> one of the true romantic comedy classics from the 20th century dudley moore makes being drunk and irresponsible look cute and amusing and it is damn fun to watch the one liners are the best
<START> ok so i hear about this new justin timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names i mean great actors like the freeman aka morgan freeman an asset to hollywood however completely wasted in this film then we got kevin spacey who i've been a great fan of ever since i watched american beauty and the usual suspects both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as i did when i heard the story then enter a fresh faced justin timberlake i say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven't hit him yet well the reason for that i might add is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review the movie is so terrible that when i got into the first 15 minutes of it the characters were so one dimensional that it makes some bible characters look like the don <UNK> they got the one liners and sound bite worthy stuff the token troubled black guy ll cool j who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life the captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone and what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming <UNK> because of an experience oh and lots of gun fire i mean a whole lot spoiler not the kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who's crooked dead and the hero <UNK> they got flame <UNK> and rocket <UNK> really no kidding br br bottom line if you want to see edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors or a great fan of justin timberlake to all the 13 year old girls out there enjoy i wish i had more hands because then i would have more thumbs because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening br br may g d have mercy on us all and save us from these terrible movies well it could be worst another <UNK> terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is <UNK> <UNK> check out in the mix lol or even get rich or die <UNK> now the special thing about that movie is that its got 30 year old men playing 16 or even younger teens i could go on with these
<START> i saw this movie once on late night t v and knew it was the best movie ever this is one of the few kung fu movies with a decent plot the progression of the main character is <UNK> the whole movie is great
<START> steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse br br this one starts with seagal getting picked up by the fbi because he killed a few people <UNK> self <UNK> he's active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen stealth plane that will be used by the cliché <UNK> english <UNK> that hollywood is so obsessed with including these days br br suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a <UNK> <UNK> of cheese and lack of acting talent the story isn't interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story characters of movie as a whole such as the <UNK> interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for <UNK> to get viewers and yet isn't even <UNK> just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn't need to br br in short a terrible script with bad dialog delivered by sub par actors boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes and non relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near impossible and make the movie even worse br br save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss even if you are <UNK> most <UNK> fan
<START> batman mystery of the batwoman is in a word stale br br the plot goes that a mysterious female vigilante batwoman is <UNK> on <UNK> <UNK> and while batman is trying to combat a penguin <UNK> rupert <UNK> <UNK> he's trying to figure out who the mysterious batwoman is br br there is nothing strikingly wrong about this but there is nothing really special about it either noting really made it stick out br br mask of the phantasm had <UNK> long lost love re surface and mess with his head br br <UNK> was a major event in the life of mr freeze br br even the batman beyond movie spin off return of the joker <UNK> deep with the characters involved br br but mystery of the batwoman had some minor subplots a lot of formula topped off by a mediocre <UNK> on a cruise boat frankly this thing is more scooby doo than dark knight lacking the punch and bite that the animated series had in it's prime
<START> i rarely write reviews for imdb com but i feel compelled to warn potential viewers that this movie is terrible just terrible i like shaw bros movies i'm not a <UNK> and i had high expectations for this one since i found it listed on many 10 best kung fu martial arts movies <UNK> i'm now convinced that those 10 best lists are all cut and <UNK> jobs first of all there's barely any action in the film most of the movie consists of talking about the plot which is an amazing feat because it's thin at best and the action itself may have been impressive back in 1978 but it's routine by today's standards a special warning to netflix users the dvd they ship is terrible the picture is horrendous and it's not even 16 9 enhanced

<START> man's castle is a wonderful example of a pre code film it involves realistic events with truly enjoyable and <UNK> characters spencer tracy plays bill a free soul without a dime in his pocket he makes a living doing odd jobs and traveling to a new city when he gets bored of his surroundings one night he meets <UNK> a beauty by any standards who is cold and alone she has refused to resort to prostitution so she has not eaten for several days but the two take very well to each other and form a relationship his free spirit <UNK> him to leave her so life is rocky but there is a true spark between the two even if they live in a shack by the river br br tracy is one of the great actors of the silver screen his characters are amazing and <UNK> we can see his thoughts on his face making him easy to identify with even if we believe he is behaving badly young is great in pre code films her character is very sweet but far from perfect making her all the more likable br br pre code elements include skinny <UNK> <UNK> before marriage and crime
<START> a vastly underrated black comedy the finest in a series of grand <UNK> movies to follow <UNK> <UNK> reynolds and winters are mothers of young convicted murderers a nod to <UNK> who run away to hide in hollywood they run a school for would be movie <UNK> a bunch of hilariously <UNK> kids attended by awful stage <UNK> debbie in her blonde wig <UNK> a harlow you're more a marion <UNK> she tells winters leads the <UNK> at their concert and wins a rich dad weaver she also does a deliciously funny tango and over all gives an outstanding performance unlike anything she'd done before the atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and eerie it looks wonderful with great period detail 30's lots of lovely <UNK> at hollywood and the terrifying movie <UNK> micheal <UNK> has a ball as the drama coach <UNK> <UNK> he <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but <UNK> <UNK> see it and love it
<START> i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it but have seen it 5 or more times a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical comedy <UNK> of new or <UNK> stars with musical groups of <UNK> kay <UNK> mysteries would be a good example br br having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action doing a fine job of support hugh o'brien plays the face buddy <UNK> the part <UNK> has it that was offered to lou <UNK> and thus <UNK> and <UNK> replacing the leads don't know if that was true br br all in all a pleasant movie but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history wish that it was released as i haven't seen or heard of it now in two decades hope it is not lost
<START> i saw this ages ago when i was younger and could never remember the title until one day i was <UNK> through john <UNK> film credits on imdb and noticed an entry named once upon a crime something <UNK> a bell and i <UNK> on it and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memories br br i've found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a great comedy it is however rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and worldwide thrills br br the movie has a large cast of characters amongst them an american couple who find a woman's dog while <UNK> in europe and decide to return it to her for a reward only to find her dead body upon arrival from there the plot gets <UNK> and <UNK> and they go on the run after the police think they are the killers br br kind of a mix between it's a mad mad mad mad world and a lighter hitchcock feature this was directed by eugene levy and he managed to get some of his good friends such as john candy to star in it the movie is mostly engaging due to its cast and the ending has a funny little twist that isn't totally unpredictable but also is kind of unexpected
<START> though this movie has a first rate <UNK> of fine actors special effects that are excellent and a story line that is full of surprises it wasn't picked up for studio distribution and went directly to dvd perhaps it contains too much <UNK> police <UNK> information or perhaps it is <UNK> one too many action flicks released during a <UNK> but whatever the reason the big screens missed the opportunity fortunately the new concept of releasing direct to dvd allows us to enjoy it br br the theme is old rookie reporter <UNK> an inner circle of cops that are corrupt in this case the f r a t first response assault and <UNK> team a group of well trained policeman created to clean up the mythical city of edison from its low point of crime drugs prostitution etc working undercover the temptation of <UNK> the <UNK> goods and money proves too much of an opportunity and now 15 years after its <UNK> frat is responsible for murder drug <UNK> <UNK> innocent people etc the lead dog is <UNK> dylan mcdermott who makes a <UNK> real gangster and his partner <UNK> deed ll cool j even more buff than usual and proving he can be a sensitive actor reporter <UNK> justin timberlake catches wind of a <UNK> <UNK> and reports his theory of fraud and corruption to his <UNK> boss <UNK> the always <UNK> fine morgan freeman gradually <UNK> convinces <UNK> and subsequently wallace kevin spacey also a consistently fine character actor and they aid <UNK> in this <UNK> <UNK> the closer <UNK> gets to the truth the more surprises and bad incidents happen and the story runs <UNK> mall toward a series of unexpected results br br timberlake lacks the charisma to carry the lead especially in the company of such seasoned actors but ll cool j freeman spacey and mcdermott keep the well <UNK> machine of a movie rolling to the very end no it is not a great movie but it is one that makes for an edge of the seat action flick with a message grady <UNK>
<START> i recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him her the chemistry between johnny <UNK> and maureen <UNK> as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen br br after the original film we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other jane's skimpy jungle wear and <UNK> protest when jane covers up for their <UNK> <UNK> that they are not just <UNK> but also quite sexually in love br br one's imagination can <UNK> the constant touching and love talk between tarzan jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about love emotionally <UNK> and sexually and jane's student is not only <UNK> but also <UNK> with his previously <UNK> sexuality br br the skin show in this film is off the <UNK> in addition to jane's two piece sexy <UNK> leg and hip <UNK> costume she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan although it is not <UNK> but olympic <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who <UNK> for her in this scene <UNK> also reveals a tremendous body and perfect <UNK> in his barely there <UNK> the ladies will delight when <UNK> emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell with his water <UNK> <UNK> practically falling off his <UNK> br br it's a shame that the over protective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry although the <UNK> tarzan films would still <UNK> in the years to come they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie
<START> this is an interesting left turn for reel 13 <UNK> two <UNK> is a b w 75 minute film from <UNK> that features non actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life i applaud the <UNK> of the reel 13 <UNK> of thinking out of the box when <UNK> this film i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with as a matter of fact i wonder if the choice had more to do with the <UNK> of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself not that two <UNK> is completely without merit but i'll get to that a little later br br as is common with independent films two <UNK> is limited in terms of location there are only two real locations  a large junk <UNK> market and a very <UNK> trailer which is the home of the middle aged main character <UNK> played by alex cole writer director james <UNK> uses the market setting to provide exposition about <UNK> who is one of the dealers there he has various people walk up to <UNK> and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information  <UNK> sells space toys he prefers to call them outer space action figures and he is a <UNK> <UNK> this is <UNK> of one of the two key problems with two <UNK> all the <UNK> i've said it before and i'll say it again  we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually there are exceptions of course but generally endless <UNK> is not so engaging on film  particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily <UNK> a notable example would be a few scenes which feature <UNK> trying to play himself off as a boy <UNK> leader in order to get a <UNK> at a store he <UNK> with the clerk back and forth and these scenes don't even advance the plot one <UNK> this is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long br br the other problem with two <UNK> is the acting i may be a bit of a <UNK> when it comes to performance in film but i really don't feel like there's a good excuse for not having good actors in your films there are plenty of good actors out there many of which willing to work on low budget projects  even in <UNK> many filmmakers <UNK> the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals but that is <UNK> in narrative film making next to the story nothing is more important than the acting performances if you don't believe the people <UNK> your story your audience is lost br br originally i thought <UNK> was using non actors but as the film went on i decided that they were probably community theater type actors it wasn't that they were uncomfortable on camera it's that they were overly theatrical i e big granted the best of the actors were the two leads  cole and catherine e johnson as cassie a lonely young girl that gets caught up in <UNK> extra <UNK> hunt they seemed to have the most training but they were still a little rough around the edges the <UNK> they displayed seemed to be surface only not coming from a real <UNK> place within ms johnson in particular is an interesting case she definitely has a presence  a <UNK> charm about her but that charisma <UNK> the <UNK> of issues her character is supposed to have she struggles to portray the <UNK> that <UNK> from a supposed life of <UNK> and slave labor relying on stock gestures like eye rolls lip biting and <UNK> to suggest her <UNK> with the outside world br br i mentioned in the first paragraph that two <UNK> is not completely without merit and here's what i mean without giving too much away there is a fade to white an hour into the film after that the story takes a stunning turn which allows the last fifteen minutes to be <UNK> and downright powerful  it's like a sucker punch to the gut but in a good way it's almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters the last five minutes of the film don't have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film  subtle detailed cole does his best work of the film and most importantly cinematic then with the closing credits comes the most <UNK> revelation of all  that it's based on a true story which got me to thinking with all the dialogue the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a <UNK> re write two <UNK> might make a really kick ass stage play  maybe even a one act if there are any bold theater producers out there reading this i definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker reel 13 or <UNK> there might be something to this story after <UNK> br br for more information on this or any other reel 13 film check out their website at www <UNK> <UNK>
<START> even steve martin and dan <UNK> couldn't save this movie from laying an <UNK> sized egg based on the classic phil <UNK> tv series it bombed because a it was updated to the 1990s and b the simple premise of the tv series was turned into a confusing feeble and silly screenplay br br the original tv series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks to expand this premise into a 1990s movie was asking for trouble and it shows no one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time
<START> this is the most depressing film i have ever seen i first saw it as a child and even thinking about it now really <UNK> me i know it was set in a time when life was hard and i know these people were poor and the <UNK> were vital yes i get all that what i find hard to take is i can't remember one single light moment in the entire film maybe it was true to life i don't know i'm quite sure the acting was top notch and the direction and quality of filming etc etc was wonderful and i know that every film can't have a happy ending but as a family film it is dire in my opinion br br i wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained by a film i can't stress enough how this film affected me as a child i was talking about it recently and all the sad memories came <UNK> back i think it would have all but the heartless reaching for the <UNK>
<START> an interesting idea for a film both showing the last dragon on earth and showing the struggle he and someone evil have together when he was younger <UNK> got stabbed in the heart so <UNK> dennis quaid took him to the dark lord who gave him half his heart now grown up <UNK> david <UNK> is now the selfish and evil king meanwhile <UNK> is using a new friend <UNK> the dragon voiced by sir sean connery to get <UNK> for killing dragons but because <UNK> has half of <UNK> hear they both feel the pain in one of them is hurt or killed also starring pete <UNK> as gilbert of <UNK> jason <UNK> as lord <UNK> julie christie as queen <UNK> and john gielgud as king arthur it was nominated for the oscar for best visual effects worth watching
<START> to the small minority seen here <UNK> this film get serious i know it's down to peoples personal opinion at the end of the day but anyone with more than a couple of brain cells can surely see that this is total rubbish so bad it does not deserve to be part of this franchise i can only assume those saying how great this is are friends with somebody involved in the film and are trying to give their career a push poor in every way don't con people by saying otherwise storyline is a weak rehash of the previous entries script is likewise attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead wow don't disguise the film makers lack of ideas and there is sadly a complete lack of any scares absolutely no redeeming qualities utter utter turd i've awarded this pair of <UNK> one mark simply for having had the <UNK> to get someone to <UNK> this piece of crap they must have put more effort into that than they did into actually making the film shame
<START> br br although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story br br one may believe that middle class teen age school girls in the 1950's easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30 year <UNK> they barely know but i doubt it br br one may believe that young high school teens are highly self confident and self assured as they interact with their <UNK> in complex social situations but my experience has been more often than not teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world br br one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not know the <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of busy earth <UNK> and not <UNK> that some lifeless bland <UNK> is fake but i think not br br one may believe that 30 something year old <UNK> can enter into and hang around inside a public school <UNK> hall during a school social and make trouble but i think that school <UNK> are <UNK> a <UNK> environment and parents <UNK> and school staff would be around to prevent this br br one final <UNK> throughout hey <UNK> <UNK> the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the <UNK> there is probably an explanation why the five were the <UNK> but because it was never detailed each reference <UNK> from each scene br br this movie did not ring true for me
<START> no wonder this movie never saw the light of day the timing was of the release was awful the <UNK> show had already jumped the shark by the time the movie came out so who would pay money just to see a few of the <UNK> clips from the original run of the show and the show clips are just a tiny bit of this pathetic 90 minute <UNK> by chuck <UNK> about how hard his life was as host of the show did he really expect we would feel sorry for him and his messed up millionaire life did he really think we even wanted to know about his life obviously so since he later wrote his weird autobiography about his career as a cia <UNK> did he think the gag of having everyone everywhere audition for him would stay fresh for 90 minutes or the network executive <UNK> him at every turn this might have worked as the plot for a 30 minute sitcom episode but not as a full length movie however it was nice to see rip taylor gene gene and the unknown comic again although to make the movie <UNK> they included only his most vulgar routines and as someone else has pointed out this is phil <UNK> first significant movie part even though it lasts only a minute note his name is spelled <UNK> in the credits which is the name he was born with you can't miss his voice and facial expressions even though he's much thinner and younger than in the snl days ed <UNK> hill street blues also has a tiny part one of his first after leaving the soap world
<START> this film <UNK> the term spring <UNK> hans the fat one of the group displays his talents as this generations chris <UNK> johnny kansas the king of the 1 bet shows he's not in kansas anymore by consistently <UNK> the stakes <UNK> laugh is truly <UNK> and offers a little eye candy for the ladies as well as does matt the <UNK> while having their moments did not do justice to the mexican hat dance like it deserves and last we have our protagonist ed he gives hope to all of us bumbling stumbling <UNK> pale folk who are still searching for that special someone and that hope is a little place called <UNK> san lucas while this blockbuster just missed the theaters this is a must rent as we can all relate to one of these spring <UNK>
<START> this movie was so bad i don't know whether to laugh or cry i had high hopes for <UNK> that year which was also the first year i attended <UNK> and i have to say <UNK> and all of its films take false advertising to a whole new level mad kudos to the <UNK> because i'm sure they tricked a lot of people into spending money and seeing those movies that year the <UNK> was easily the worst one of the ones i've seen the other ones i saw were <UNK> dark ride and reincarnation the movie cover and trailer made it seem like a family of cannibals <UNK> the neighborhood which i thought was a rather interesting plot only to be disappointed at the end discovering that it was some <UNK> of <UNK> tale about a boy's transition into being a vampire which is why drama <UNK> over any sense of horror in this film and to make the plot even more ridiculous they add in a set of horny twins who can't wait to take a <UNK> out of one another and some deadly creature locked in the basement which if i had discovered what <UNK> was had the secret not been revealed at the very end of the film i would have left the theater halfway into the movie br br complete waste of money and time cut forty minutes out of this film and make it into an episode on some show like <UNK> or <UNK> or supernatural and it would have received more praise than this absolute rubbish so bad that two years later i have to come back to imdb and write a review about it because it still stands out in my memory as one of the worst movies i've ever seen also while you're reading this steer clear from the rest of the <UNK> movies in the future the most you could do is rent them from blockbusters or watch it online somewhere <UNK> features movies from independent filmmakers who can't make it onto the big screen and all the crap about <UNK> they don't show you in <UNK> they weren't referring to blood or guts or horror they were referring to the movies themselves because they're horrendous think of <UNK> as a less renowned version of sundance film festival but for horror movies br br sorry for all the <UNK> but next time think twice before you cheat <UNK> out of their money
<START> after being forced to sit through some real <UNK> racing <UNK> shark boy and <UNK> girl i truly enjoyed watching fried worms for once i did not guess the ending it was funny and entertaining and didn't resort to a ton of gross out humor despite the title my boys 6 and 10 both loved it too oh and my 45 year old boy had a smile on his face the whole time this is a family movie that is not just tolerable for the parents the relationship with the little brother is so close to real life he is not stopping singing just to annoy me also the way the new kid tries to make friends and how those friendships actually form is right on with the way kids behave of course the parents have to act a little goofy but my favorite scenes involved the dad getting used to his new job have fun
<START> yet another remake of <UNK> of dollars sergio <UNK> remake of <UNK> <UNK> suggested by the novel <UNK> <UNK> br br this one is strictly a b movie taken as that it is rather enjoyable the direction is crisp the acting full of <UNK> the limitations of its <UNK> to <UNK> photography well handled br br the weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the <UNK> <UNK> plot to a sub plot from <UNK> <UNK> upon a time in the <UNK> although <UNK> directed both <UNK> and <UNK> his motivations behind the two films couldn't be anymore different the <UNK> with no <UNK> eastwood is a borderline <UNK> path with a soft spot for broken families <UNK> <UNK> bronson is obsessed with his own broken family and obsessed with revenge these two characters would not have had much to do with each other in order to bring them together <UNK> <UNK> has to twist it's plot and <UNK> it until we lose track of which story we're actually following br br but this is a b movie after all and filled with action and silliness it's entertaining on that level just don't expect anything more
<START> comedy central has a habit of putting on great programs at times <UNK> show the daily show <UNK> report and then there are those that some people love or hate stella dr <UNK> then there are some shows that have their <UNK> but are just plain awful <UNK> and now sarah silverman br br this show is based on the fact silverman is self centered which can be funny <UNK> report but can be horrible mind of <UNK> it should shock no one that i believe the latter is the case this show is a parody of a sitcom and society a program so absurd it loses itself in its absurdity and it simply isn't funny a woman <UNK> has been done in comedy many many times because its not something that's common we don't need 25 minutes of it when a criminal is <UNK> by a <UNK> it simply loses its appeal we saw it in jay and silent bob strike back except the women were <UNK> and the whole scene was more absurd making it better but the best comparison of this show is to stella except stella was more subtle which is what made the <UNK> comedy funny it had better acting and i suppose a bit more of a <UNK> <UNK> view br br perhaps the fact some reviews are so negative i'm very skeptical of the critical acclaim but do not <UNK> fan reaction to this show is the amount of advertising on it very obnoxious ads through many programs far <UNK> advertising on for other programs many people are wondering why sarah silverman has a career and others are still bitter when better shows have been canceled this show should've never made it past the <UNK> pilot stage back to norm showed far more promise yet this show makes it further and as far as critics being correct many things have been universally <UNK> have seen their status rise immensely last i checked britney spears gets good reviews too also take that comparison however you want because someone will no doubt <UNK> me of being psychotic on imdb for not liking this show
<START> brand <UNK> john cusack is an assassin for the cia he is ordered to go to the country of <UNK> a nation that the united states has <UNK> and kill a businessman named omar <UNK> this is because the american <UNK> <UNK> that is putting the country back together will not stand for <UNK> an oil man from a <UNK> state laying down his own <UNK> through war torn <UNK> but once there brand runs into difficulties one he meets a determined journalist natalie marisa tomei who wants to tell the american public the true story of the <UNK> conflict and of <UNK> but brand is <UNK> to realize that <UNK> pretty face and sharp mind instantly and <UNK> <UNK> him to lose focus on his mission also his cover as a trade show host forces him to meet the country's pop singing princess <UNK> <UNK> duff who will be getting married at the convention center she is a young <UNK> whose wedding <UNK> also turn <UNK> attention away from the coming assassination with other inept <UNK> and complications will brand be able to carry out his mission for the satisfaction of <UNK> big boss the former vice president dan <UNK> good for you john cusack to make this film even though it doesn't quite hold together shot in <UNK> it is a worthy look at what present day iraq must be like a country turned upside down in a stroke a brilliance the green zone here is called the <UNK> city and <UNK> so for this oz like neighborhood attempts to keep out the <UNK> of war going on elsewhere in the metropolis the cast is very fine with cusack doing a nice job and tomei joan cusack ben kingsley <UNK> and others backing him up in style duff especially does a great turn as the heavily <UNK> heavily made up <UNK> mouthed singer the recreation of war <UNK> <UNK> is so real that it hurts while the costumes and other production values are top notch as for the script it isn't always cohesive but it certainly has some tremendous dialogue and scenes for example a young <UNK> boy offers to show brand an enemy <UNK> in exchange for money and candy brand produces the cash but because he has no candy the boy burns his vehicle anyway brilliant then also the direction is not a total success but doesn't <UNK> very often no if you have conservative <UNK> you probably won't like this film one bit but if you have an open mind and want to see a satirical view of the war on terrorism this is quite a good show therefore do make an effort to view it as you will be supporting those filmmakers who choose to make movies far away from those old studio <UNK>
