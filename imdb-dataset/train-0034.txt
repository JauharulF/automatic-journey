<START> a film i expected very little from and only watched to pass a quiet hour but what an hour it turned out to be roll is an excellent if none too serious little story of <UNK> boy lost in the big city makes <UNK> it is funny throughout the characters are endearing and the pace is just right br br toby malone is the true star of the film with his endearing portrayal of matt said country boy and local aussie rules football hero come to the big city to try out for one of the big teams he is supported superbly by john <UNK> as local gangster tiny watch out for these two br br highly recommended
<START> this film moved me beyond <UNK> it is and will remain my favourite film of all time mainly because it has almost every emotion all rolled into its <UNK> minutes what is the hardest part for me to take is that whenever i want to hear the amazing music and songs from the film i have to put it into my dvd player so i was wondering if anyone anywhere knows who sings the songs in the film and where they can be found as i have looked everywhere i can think <UNK> over the past 5 years my favourite quote from the film is when in court the <UNK> says but your own words ask for direct confrontation isn't that a direct call for violence biko replies well you and i are in confrontation now but i see no violence br br craig robertson <UNK> scotland
<START> director kevin connor and wannabe action hero romantic lead doug <UNK> re team in this ghost story set in japan they had been moderately successful together in the 1970's with the likes of 'the land that time <UNK> 1975 <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> 1976 etc without plastic monsters to carry the narrative along though the results are <UNK> and derivative in the most corny way br br the film begins with a prologue set in the 19th century with a samurai husband killing his wife and her lover before committing suicide a move forward to the present introduces married couple ted laura visiting japan and moving in to the house where the tragedy took place br br no surprises as to what happens next with the spirits of the dead starting to take over the new inhabitants with family friend alex <UNK> assuming the role of the wife's lover br br everything <UNK> clumsily along with the <UNK> and grace of a <UNK> elephant to an inevitable but surprisingly downbeat conclusion main points of interest are two feeble <UNK> 'the <UNK> has a lot to answer for in promoting this as a standard horror set piece and the love making scenes featuring the <UNK> eyed but extremely kinky susan george the first is a long <UNK> look <UNK> inspired piece with her <UNK> complete with piano music the second a much shorter probably at her <UNK> <UNK> with <UNK> both looking pretty uncomfortable anyway every cloud has a silver <UNK> and both scenes show of her fantastic <UNK> so all is not lost br br overall i can't decide whether 'the house where evil <UNK> is rubbish watchable rubbish or entertaining in a <UNK> kind of way if you're not into the genre there is nothing here at all but for horror fans there is probably enough to <UNK> the odd <UNK> smile and <UNK> nod of respect for effort br br best scene in any other film the big black tree climbing japanese <UNK> mechanical <UNK> would have stolen the show they are <UNK> though by the legendary family meal scene where a ghostly head appears in the daughters soup on seeing this <UNK> she asks what kind of soup it is to be told <UNK> and <UNK> before <UNK> the immortal line ugh there's an awful face in my soup if this wasn't enough the <UNK> is c'mon eat your soup for daddy laurel hardy rest in piece
<START> the main problem with power is that it features way too may pointless characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the movie whatsoever it gets boring after awhile sitting around waiting through scenes that don't connect to find something that drives the movie forward you could probably pass it all off as character development but all of them are either recycled from earlier scenes in the movie or are just simply to flat and uninteresting lumet never gives enough time to let any of the supporting cast <UNK> he should have cut a few of the characters hackman the wife and concentrated harder on others <UNK> it could have been a great hard political thriller instead of a <UNK> mess that loses any message in a sea of bad writing and acting a fact that amazed me considering the cast even gene hackman performance wasn't up to par denzel washington is the only real actor of note here gere and the others have all done much better performances elsewhere br br sidney lumet needs to go back to the fierce one man shows he did in the seventies i e <UNK> and stop trying to <UNK> his success with 12 angry men and fail safe it hasn't worked yet sidney and it most likely never will leave the ensemble dramas to altman br br 3 10 br br
<START> this is not a very good movie but it's not a stinker either it is very confusing and unnecessarily long so rent it at your own risk br br my <UNK> and i have figured this movie out we think so here it is br br major spoilers below br br firstly this movie is actually quite simple after you remove all of the confusing unconscious dream state junk 95 of the movie br br ignoring the junk what really happened is this a group of school friends go to a rave one night they leave and get into a car accident where everyone but cassie and sean die that's the simple cut down version that's right i said sean bear with me br br right after the accident cassie lays in the hospital stuck in between life death right up until the very end of the movie this is where the dream part starts br br the movie is called soul survivors right <UNK> mind and soul carries on after the accident <UNK> with the other souls annie matt <UNK> the 2 <UNK> and jude along with images <UNK> up by her mind sean school and everything else around her the souls continue doing what they were defined as annie the rave going chick the 2 weirdo killers from opening scene father jude still helping people etc br br we are then taken on a very long ride shown lots of images many of which my <UNK> and i still can't tie in but it all <UNK> down to it not being <UNK> time to die br br at the end cassie wakes up in the hospital after being dead for a while her family and sean are there this is reality again she's ok br br then the director adds a little extra spice by trying to confuse us again by showing a little dream <UNK> of her in the wheelchair being <UNK> but this part is really just a nightmare and she wakes up beside sean obviously still dealing with her traumatic experience br br due to space <UNK> we didn't cover every little thing but feel free to drop us an e mail if you want to br br
<START> yes you guessed it another movie where identical twins switch places i think now that the olsen twins are getting older they should try and make the plot less predictable and less like re runs of <UNK> <UNK> if you plan on seeing this film don't watch 'the parent <UNK> instead it's more entertaining
<START> having read the comments on the site i feel compelled to write in for the first time it seems this movie is like <UNK> and has split the audience i have to say that while i agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable see <UNK> drive they still have to engage you with the characters now while i was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in lynch's <UNK> i have to say i couldn't give a turd about mr green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this <UNK> world br br also while so many people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it i would have to disagree i didn't enjoy because i was bored i wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help call it clever if you will i think it's <UNK> br br however my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question there were no end credits on the print of the film i saw just music over black did i watch a dud print or is this evidence of <UNK> <UNK> or did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed
<START> running man isn't a great movie in fact it's kinda silly but it delivers what you want in an arnie movie and that is action and entertainment i don't see how anyone couldn't enjoy this picture it's so silly and over the top that it almost makes fun of itself by the way this is probably one of the most <UNK> arnie movies out there
<START> the movie opens with a beautiful lady in a <UNK> white <UNK> running through a stereotypical eastern european town we know she's being followed by something because she keeps looking behind her and soon we see she's being chased by a mysterious man in a black <UNK> then we realize that the man is actually the vampire hunter and he is after her but look is that her reflection in the store window no its just her identical twin vampire but unfortunately they both get it br br after this brilliant and amazingly fun <UNK> to the old hammer films of the 60's and 70's in the credits the twins are listed as the twins of evil which of course is the name of the final <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> trilogy the plot pretty much dies br br what little plot there is involves dracula who conveniently changes his appearance each time he is <UNK> so the producer doesn't have to <UNK> the same dracula coming to a <UNK> the <UNK> students realizing he's undead and thinking wow what an opportunity maybe i'll just disregard all those movies that say that drinking vampire blood turns you into a vampire and use the <UNK> blood to find a cure for our jerk friend's <UNK> obviously this is a mistake and everyone becomes a vampire br br a new concept but pulled off excruciatingly badly the movie keeps setting up wonderful situations and refuses to do anything with them br br for example the <UNK> students attempt to bring <UNK> back to life by placing him in a <UNK> filled with blood in a secluded run down country mansion the house itself is scary enough to be the center of the film but do we stay there no because they decide to take the vampire to an abandoned swimming pool sigh this movie has a real problem with <UNK> as i mentioned before the opening scene is straight out of hammer and this house scene would have been perfect for a hammer like movie but the movie rapidly switches <UNK> and changes to a medical horror br br the other problem is that they introduce so many characters it is almost impossible to feel sorry for any of them there are the <UNK> students and their wheelchair bound professor type friend the <UNK> students are all arrogant boring money hungry and stupid how they made it to <UNK> school at all <UNK> me unless the <UNK> school had to meet its muscle bound hunk big breast <UNK> and then there is the vampire hunter who remains mysterious through the movie hey i can respect that but it would be nice if they didn't set it up like the movie would be about him then you have random priests cops and science types so many people are introduced and then quickly forgotten about until they need that person to either save the day or jump out for a cheap scare that it becomes quickly tedious br br basically this is a lazy movie no real scares just a few predictable jump scares the set up for these is so elaborate it is hilarious for <UNK> le the <UNK> full of blood it is so obvious that <UNK> is going to pop out of the murky blood and yet we have to wait far too long to get to the inevitable jump scare after this he kills one of the dumber and larger <UNK> <UNK> students we all know she's going to become one of the undead but what do the others do bury her in a shallow grave near the house sigh so you know who will jump out at you when the cops show up at the house br br oh well br br maybe someone will get the hint that it is impossible to make a scary vampire movie and just go for atmospheric and then we will end up with an entire movie that is as good as the opening scene br br
<START> this film is one that played very well back in 1932 and probably wouldn't work as well today because its style it a bit old fashioned and contrived however if you are the sort person like me who <UNK> older hollywood films you cut the film a bit of slack and can enjoy it for what it is an interesting soap br br the film is set in a ward for problem <UNK> in this large room are about a half dozen <UNK> in which women are waiting to give birth but doctors are concerned about possible complications <UNK> such a room would really <UNK> the mothers and like an episode of love boat or fantasy island each mother has her own special story with so many rather extreme and crazy stories you have to suspend disbelief i could and enjoyed the film quite a bit br br here are a few of the stories one involves a father you don't see the mom but he is a very very nervous father and it's included for comic relief however he was wonderful here very touching br br loretta young and eric <UNK> are a sad case loretta is sent to the hospital from prison she apparently killed some horrible guy you don't know exactly what occurred but you assume he was trying to force himself on her yet she was given a 20 year sentence and her husband is devoted to her and is by her side as much as he can br br glenda farrell is an awful person she has the <UNK> instincts of a <UNK> a really really bad and alcoholic <UNK> she is pretty funny and worth seeing through most of the film i loved her drinking from a hot water bottle filled with <UNK> as well as becoming upset when she learns she can't make money selling her twins late in the film she has a typical hollywood style change of heart that was supposed to be touching i found it contrived br br there is a woman who has given birth to a still born baby amazingly <UNK> they put the lady back in the same ward as the women waiting to give birth a crazy woman who you assumed lost a baby some time ago wanders down from the psychiatric unit she insists she's having a baby later she escapes again and actually takes one of the kids br br there are most stories than this but the ones i mentioned are the main ones as i said it's a soap opera of sorts and is highly entertaining and quite sad in the case of several of the stories the ending in particular is heart breaking and exceptionally well done there were a few particularly good performances especially farrell and <UNK> <UNK> as the head nurse all in all a very good film and i have no idea why they felt they had to remake the film just a few years later which was typical for warner brothers
<START> i expected a comedy like the big mama movies instead the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy drama and a love story br br this movie has three plots the first involves <UNK> and her taking in a foster child the second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who is <UNK> her the third involves a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single father br br there is actually very little comedy in the movie there are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie for example <UNK> beats the foster child with a belt in a comedic manner to convince the child to <UNK> out the child does in fact turn herself around apparently it pays to beat children br br there are plots dealing with child rape with the <UNK> of the mother there are scenes with old men <UNK> young girls who are related to them the <UNK> takes place at a family reunion the movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always off balance is this a comedy a love story or a drama it is in fact nothing except a waste of time and money
<START> a funny comedy from beginning to end there are several hilarious scenes but it's also loaded with many subtle comedic moments which is what made the movie for me creative story line with a very talented cast i thoroughly enjoyed it
<START> a great story based on a true story about a young black man and all the difficulties along the road being that this is denzel <UNK> first ever movie that he himself was gonna direct i have to admit i was a tad <UNK> but who wouldn't be but then again he's a great actor with <UNK> of years of experience and the end result turned out great the story is told in a great way making you that has had difficulties during your childhood and young <UNK> see yourself in those situations so it hits you hard letting you know your not the only one going through hell in all a touching story about a young man trying to make it in this f ed up world the story is based on the life of antwone fisher born 3 august 1959 cleveland <UNK> usa whom was also the writer of this movie strongly recommended 8 10
<START> you gotta wonder how some <UNK> ever get made this one decided to skip with the why among many other things and just wanders off beyond the <UNK> br br and yet you have a number of decent actors doing their best to <UNK> some life into the story the blue <UNK> throughout the movie <UNK> into <UNK> <UNK> which on its own would be depressing but here it's <UNK> the idea that it's not a medical condition not some house or gypsy or <UNK> curse but just something that for no apparent reason starts to happen to our protagonist and then to everyone else around her just winds up being much like taking a big <UNK> out of an empty <UNK> some <UNK> have super powers but others don't or don't know they do it seems they're just as clueless as we are br br it's a poor man's rip off of invasion of the body <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> mirror and the sixth sense were you to seriously <UNK> those three together
<START> i saw this on a <UNK> <UNK> with the english subtitles i thought the story was good but there were times when some of the <UNK> were grossly over acting this took away from the film as did the fairly lame musical score which really <UNK> me throughout the entire movie if the musical score was improved i could overlook the few <UNK> scenes then the film would be much much better
<START> my girlfriend and i were stunned by how bad this film was after 15 minutes we would have called it <UNK> except we were too curious to see if the film could possibly redeem itself it didn't br br i can't understand the praise given to this film the writing was downright awful and delivered by some of the worst acting i have seen in a very long time br br one thing that especially annoyed me about this film was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines i understand using a pause to create a feeling of <UNK> like in happiness this was not that type of pause it was just simply bad directing this film might actually be much better with subtitles and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film because then the <UNK> dialogue and bad acting wouldn't be noticed as much br br i generally like these types of small quirky films the real blonde walking and talking lovely and amazing but this one failed on so many levels that i consider it one of the very worst films i have sat through in the last few years
<START> to be honest i'm surprised by the positive votes that this film has received the movie just drags along its <UNK> minute life span and the audience has to suffer the whole way through actually there are some positive moments in this film charlie <UNK> gives a decent performance she is given some pretty pathetic dialogue and she handles it pretty well scott valentine <UNK> boyfriend in family ties on the other hand is a pretty rough watch i guess the highlight of his performance is witnessing the guy laying on the beach wearing tiger <UNK> <UNK> give me a break also valentine gives us a <UNK> and pathetic portrayal of a suffering vampire who misses the day to see a much more convincing rendition of the suffering vampire see <UNK> duff in <UNK> <UNK> 4 the movie moves so slow and is only positively <UNK> by and to be honest charlie <UNK> dance scenes this movie can honestly only be recommended to the die hard fans of charlie <UNK> which i am and i still had a rough time watching it
<START> a weird witty and wonderful depiction of family life writer andrew marshall has written something that is funny foreboding and occasionally frightening yes don't be fooled by <UNK> children's cheerful tune and <UNK> characters the show has a dark side and at times can be quite chilling and that's what's so good about the show it's not just a simplistic sitcom where every character is a <UNK> comic device the case with my family instead the characters are fully rounded individuals that show the full roller coaster of human emotions the occasionally dark moments such as bill being supposedly haunted by a curse and ben waking up in a bizarre village are two examples of the show taking a surreal dark turn that help add a little depth of course the show is also incredibly funny and is a guaranteed to make you smile it's a real shame <UNK> video have stopped releasing this comical gold on dvd <UNK> com is your last hope to get hold of episodes <UNK> in the <UNK>
<START> this was barbra <UNK> first television special and is must see viewing for any streisand fan even non streisand fans will enjoy this highly energetic and entertaining piece of entertainment history performers like this only come our way once in a lifetime brilliant
<START> my comments for vivah its a charming idealistic love story starring shahid kapoor and amrita <UNK> the film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and <UNK> families sleeping on the floor playing games together their friendly banter and mutual respect vivah is about the <UNK> of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals yes the central romance is <UNK> <UNK> but the <UNK> in romantic moments between the to be married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern <UNK> games makes you <UNK> for the <UNK> the film predictably concludes with the marriage and the <UNK> on the wedding night tells his new bride who suffers from burn <UNK> come let me do your dressing br br v i v a h showcases a lot of good things beauty of arranged marriage beauty of indian culture beauty of indian woman last but not least a nice <UNK> of the about to be couple waiting to get married playing by the rules simple yet beautiful such a simple story no plot no villain as is the case with most of <UNK> <UNK> films <UNK> sir is back to what he does best he has made the movie with full conviction its a very sweet film which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout arranged marriage the union of 2 families i think amrita <UNK> looks very good she has acted very well she has most of the good scenes although i thought the last half hour was completely to shahid <UNK> who for a change gives an <UNK> restrained performance i also liked the acting of all others for ex the <UNK> i e amrita <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in law it almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could <UNK> sir has got another nice family film to his credit after <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the chemistry between shahid amrita is awesome br br stuff like <UNK> in a marriage relationship avoiding <UNK> mutual respect care space waiting for getting married officially praying <UNK> for <UNK> beloved all these and more get <UNK> in vivah there's still some good audience who r going enjoying this film some of the folks audience are already excited after seeing that they r thinking bout arranged marriage thats success if you ask me it seems amrita <UNK> our actress from vivah result for a nice performance has been <UNK> the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> award for 2006 hats off to her for this achievement <UNK> even though vivah shahid or amrita didn't get any of the film fare other awards least this is news to cheer about <UNK> to amrita <UNK> for showing us a visual of indian bride to be in the <UNK> form and of course to <UNK> <UNK> for portraying her the best way <UNK> forget shahid <UNK> and all others who make vivah as sweet and legendary as it is today imagine to share the same <UNK> as the legendary <UNK> kumar its no mean achievement <UNK> to amrita <UNK> for taking her career to another level with this award i personally feel she should keep doing movies only with shahid <UNK> they make a cute couple and their on screen chemistry reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> khan <UNK> <UNK> br br some points that i observed few of the elements 1 if u notice carefully amrita <UNK> looks so good because <UNK> always wearing traditional dresses she gives every bit of the indian woman essence in this film perfect fit 2 shahid <UNK> is like most of us not exactly ready for marriage or early marriage but <UNK> <UNK> carefully to the step wise talk given by his dad having full faith in <UNK> <UNK> eventually honesty trust are the <UNK> that he reflects in his first talk with amrita most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person but according to what i saw in this film i have a feeling that two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also its possible 3 in the entire movie there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where shahid amrita are together or shown to be together its unlike most other romantic wedding based movies where hero heroine are always singing dancing or nowadays doing cheap stuff but the beauty of each of these 5 sequences <UNK> by restraint innocence respect for the other 4 i really liked the relationship shown between <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> amrita <UNK> these kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters girl kids in some parts of india 5 romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely no cheap scenes songs are beautifully <UNK> words like <UNK> <UNK> e t c are going to be <UNK> for all girls who liked this film personally i really am fond of many dialogs in this film 6 last but not the least the entire hospital scene where shahid puts <UNK> to amrita when <UNK> struggling for life is terrific those dialogs between the couple are so touching and u feel the love i cant do without u its a hats off feeling br br in many ways vivah reminded me of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> se <UNK> <UNK> hum <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> for the <UNK> on screen chemistry of the lead pair if u ask me along with films like <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> corporate and <UNK> express v i v a h ranks among the best films made in 2006 in fact i think vivah does deserve better viewing business than <UNK> or <UNK> or <UNK> or all those time pass fuzzy style crap movies
<START> halfway through <UNK> <UNK> evening a woman on her <UNK> asks a figure appearing in her <UNK> can you tell me where my life went the line could be embarrassingly theatrical but the woman speaking it is vanessa redgrave delivering it with utter simplicity and the question tears your heart out br br time and again the film based on susan <UNK> novel <UNK> sentimentality and <UNK> it holds attention offers admirable performances and <UNK> emotional involvement as few recent movies have with only six months of the year gone there are now two memorable meaningful worthwhile films in theaters the other of course being sara <UNK> away from her hollywood might have turned evening into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two <UNK> of real life mothers and daughters vanessa redgrave and natasha richardson and meryl streep and <UNK> <UNK> richardson is <UNK> daughter in the film with a sister played by tony collette and <UNK> plays <UNK> younger self while <UNK> youthful incarnation is claire danes br br add glenn close <UNK> <UNK> hugh <UNK> patrick wilson and a large cast yes it could have turned into a multiple star platform instead <UNK> the brilliant hungarian cinematographer of <UNK> and director of <UNK> created a subtle ensemble work with a <UNK> feel the story taking place in a high society <UNK> environment in the days leading up to a wedding that is <UNK> with trouble br br missed connections wrong choices and <UNK> <UNK> with social and family <UNK> present quite a soap opera but the quality of the writing <UNK> direction and <UNK> acting raise evening way above that level into the the <UNK> air of english french and a few american family <UNK> from a century before its contemporary setting br br complex relationships between mothers and daughters between friends and lovers with the addition of a difficult triangle all come across clearly understandably <UNK> individual tunes are woven into a <UNK> br br and yet with the all the <UNK> emphasis on ensemble and <UNK> performances the stars of evening still shine through redgrave richardson <UNK> an exciting new discovery looking vaguely like her mother but a very different actress danes carrying most of the load until streep shows up in the final moments and of course steals the show <UNK> and wilson are well worth the price of admission too br br as with away from her evening stays with you at length <UNK> a re thinking its story and characters and re experiencing the emotions it raises at two hours the film runs a bit long but the way it stays with you thereafter is welcome among the many movies that go cold long before your popcorn
<START> i have only recently been able to catch up with the films of marilyn miller since they are not shown on tcm in the uk i have been much intrigued over the years because this was one of the <UNK> of the <UNK> what was she really like to some stars of this era like <UNK> some of the magic still shines through but alas not for miller her dancing seems awkward and poorly choreographed her singing somewhat limited and as an actress she makes ruby keeler seem like hepburn even worse in this film as the public had grown tired of musicals virtually all of the musical numbers have been deleted so we are left with a comedy of that period with little real appeal she was being paid <UNK> for this so i have only two conclusion either she was poorly served by the cinema or she had no talent at all i think that the truth is <UNK> the later than the former
<START> story about four teenage girls growing up in california <UNK> jodie foster is the most level headed of the bunch but wants to move out of her house where she lives with her divorced mother sally <UNK> annie <UNK> <UNK> is addicted to drugs alcohol and bad boys and is beaten up by her father <UNK> marilyn <UNK> has <UNK> parents <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> thinks she's more mature than the rest of them br br this is nothing new from what we've seen plenty of times before but this one has one big difference it's accurate i <UNK> from high school in 1980 when i first saw the film and i was surprised at how realistic it was they got the dialogue clothes and attitudes down completely right even the main song of the movie on the radio by donna summer was a big hit before this came out this film hit me harder than any other teen film of the time because i could understand and relate to the characters i knew girls in high school who were just like this the film is of course dated but it captures a time we will never see again br br the acting is good on all counts with foster giving the best performance the relationship between her and <UNK> who was excellent was realistic and well done even scott <UNK> who has a small role as a friend of the girls more or less realistically played a teen boy br br a very good movie essential viewing if you came of age in 1980 the film has a deserved r rating plenty of drug use and swearing but should be seen by all teens i give it a 8
<START> i just watched antwone fisher on bravo what an awesome movie and incredible young man this movie is a must see for anyone who is dealing with how to overcome childhood abuse and <UNK> as an adult denzel washington puts in an outstanding performance as well as the young man who plays antwone fisher <UNK> alert feel good and <UNK> the most <UNK> moment is when he finally meets his mother who he was taken away from at 2 months of age and one of the most courageous was when he stood up to his abusive foster mother and sister i saw this movie on bravo in 2008 and only wish i had known about it years ago definitely a movie to add to my dvd collection
<START> i did not think this movie was worth anything bad script bad acting except for <UNK> turner no fantasy stupid plot dumb ass husband and unfair divorce settings if you have never seen this movie before don't even bother it's not worth it at all the only thing that was good about it was that <UNK> turner did a good job acting <UNK> husband is a stuck up smart ass defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even gotten <UNK> murderers off he think he is so smart but he is really just a nut her best friend has an affair with her husband and betrays her nice girl huh yeah she's a real <UNK> not she's no day at the beach either
<START> with all due <UNK> for this george stevens sr epic of <UNK> and <UNK> i can only wonder that the james dean legend could survive this outing i submit that then studio <UNK> to <UNK> box office giants came a <UNK> of its own <UNK> nor were rock and liz that much better off let us just say that the <UNK> dallas was the authentic heir even if <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> like lay and <UNK> not to mention our <UNK> president of these here <UNK> states of <UNK> perform a one <UNK> of <UNK> global <UNK> i never read <UNK> <UNK> original but will lay odds it is head and shoulders superior to what got on screen <UNK> and all those well paid i would imagine supporting actors of note and celebrity notwithstanding giant is to me at least a midget of <UNK> merit never mind the <UNK> <UNK>
<START> crush <UNK> female friendship for the most part avoiding the <UNK> quality which <UNK> so many films with the same theme e g steel <UNK> at the same time it reveals the power of a sudden passion to <UNK> and surprise the events depicted were highly improbable but the underlying emotional truth seemed very genuine to me not a film for the <UNK> vehicle and explosion crowd but grown up women are certain to respond with both laughter and tears
<START> i never attended the midnight showing of a movie before dick tracy came out br br i still have the t shirt ticket i had to wear to get admitted to the showing around here somewhere and like that shirt dick tracy has stuck with me ever since br br if you've seen the movie the sharp visuals bright primary colors and strong characters have no doubt been <UNK> into your brain it's a wonder to behold br br as director star co writer producer beatty knows what works in a film and shows it here taking a familiar american icon and re creating him for a whole new era still set in the <UNK> tracy has a kind of timeless quality like all good films do i've lost track of how many times i've watched tracy and i still catch something new every time i do br br the others are all top notch starting with <UNK> big boy <UNK> a reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them even <UNK> breathless <UNK> is a <UNK> in that under the right environment she can act gasp br br but there's still such themes touched on as the necessity of family keeping true to one's self good versus evil even <UNK> themes are explored odd for a comic strip film but hey it works br br all in all dick tracy is a classic <UNK> itself compared with other films of this decade it makes a strong statement it's a good strong film that doesn't depend on blood violence profanity or nudity to make its point br br there's a lesson to be learned here br br ten stars great scott
<START> east palace west palace reminded me somewhat of the detective with frank sinatra in the role of the cop and william <UNK> is the boy it's a <UNK> film for china i guess but it also <UNK> <UNK> about the <UNK> of gay men much is made of chinese <UNK> in which men take on female roles the movie focuses on an <UNK> man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy he <UNK> the park without fear he hopes to be taken into the <UNK> by the officer and that in fact happens then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture made to <UNK> for a period of time <UNK> slapped this is what the gay man wants and <UNK> the gay man is challenging the <UNK> self image as a <UNK> man the story's about the gay man's life which include flashbacks are tolerable but when he starts describing old chinese <UNK> and dramatic works the movie becomes unbearable it becomes a cry of pity for <UNK> gays who only want to fulfill a traditional role in chinese society sorry i can't relate
<START> this movie is not as good as all think the actors are <UNK> and the story is very comic like i respect fantasy but lord of the rings is fantasy conan is fantasy this is just normal hk <UNK> entertainment why did they include this splatter tongue it makes everything worse the only good thing is the cinematography and the <UNK> job
<START> nick nolte gives an excellent performance in kurt <UNK> dark tale <UNK> plays howard w campbell who was a double agent working in propaganda during world war ii after the war he lives <UNK> until competing <UNK> wish to dig up his past as with much of <UNK> work this is a <UNK> on the absurdity of war and those who use propaganda for their own aims nolte is fantastic self assured and confident as the younger campbell and then broken and haunted as the older man who is forced to <UNK> for the sins of his past 7 out of 10
<START> this isn't a movie it is a collection of unrelated ill conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the <UNK> results of a dim 10 year old with a mini <UNK> camera in fact i have a theory that the extremely <UNK> girl in the train <UNK> the one with the <UNK> hair dead pan stare <UNK> and nervous <UNK> probably shot it herself in a creative phase br br if you made it further than the ten minutes i did don't bother trying to fit what you saw into the context of the european <UNK> mentality praised above this is a true and complete waste of time money and film that would have made william one shot <UNK> cringe br br the unfortunate part is that the endless series of <UNK> packed characters is representative of what now passes for much of humanity br br what's next six directors shooting social <UNK> at the wal mart <UNK> counter
<START> i saw this film when it was first released the memory of how bad it was has stayed with me almost forty years i didn't want to trust my own sentiments about the movie when i saw it so i <UNK> a movie review published in a major <UNK> newspaper the next day sentiment confirmed the reviewer wrote that the movie was incoherent <UNK> and uninspiring a little research reveals that the producer was star leslie <UNK> husband thus the <UNK> of <UNK> suggests the beginning for this awful film the film's <UNK> of many capable actors caron warren <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gloria <UNK> and james <UNK> among others suggests that it holds some promise but the death of this film is <UNK> to its terrible screenplay the mystery <UNK> is so obscure and so little revealed throughout the film that the viewer is left <UNK> from scene to scene the movie seems torn between being a detective mystery and an espionage thriller but never <UNK> upon one or the other the sense of suspense is entirely absent the main characters settle on playing dry <UNK> types in a fashion that <UNK> no empathy whatsoever the cinematography is pedestrian the result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters the plot and in the end the film itself i am little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film available to purchase i hope that if tcm finds a print of this film and feels compelled to air it that it is safely <UNK> to the 4 00 am <UNK>
<START> this three stooges flick is at a tie with my other favorite flick disorder in the court this is an <UNK> of laughter for any three stooges fan to enjoy br br the boys are <UNK> at a recording studio when they hear the lovely christine <UNK> sings a great version of voices of spring she is going to be offered a record deal but she is <UNK> to be honest with her father about her choice of a career and prove herself as a real singer when she and the others leave the studio the stooges decide to have a little fun and play her record and dress curly up as christine the contract lady who can make <UNK> career sees curly and mistakes him for christine and invites curly to sing for her party of course there is a man that they have upset that is at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd so he'll find a way to get back at them br br what a great <UNK> flick this should not be missed br br 10 10
<START> an acted manipulated documentary about one of the most darkest places of <UNK> portrayed as a fun secure but sad place were a bunch of sex workers get to play in a soccer team assembled in what seems like no more than a week the <UNK> main focus is to prove that society <UNK> this kind of workers even though no solution to these poor women is ever achieved except that the people who documented this made them some sort of stars just like the title says so in exchange of being exploited for making this <UNK> documentary it does have however its own documented reality but that sadly has nothing to do with the main storyline i would not accept to see it again but i would recommend it for general cultural purposes only
<START> i have seen this movie a whole dozen times and it's awesome but the only thing with it was that in the beginning there was too much talk of who's going out with who i think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it but on the official site they said that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it what's even happened to patty <UNK> now she is a pretty good actress she has done several other movies in the 70s and 80s but we haven't heard from her since i know for sure about <UNK> <UNK> who plays jerry works for <UNK> at <UNK> films but overall i have to say that the series itself is like left behind gone old school
<START> not for people without swift mind or without a drop of <UNK> blood in their <UNK> if you don't have any of these you can not understand it and if you don't understand you can't enjoy it for example if you think <UNK> is a name of a car produced by <UNK> probably if you see a <UNK> painting you just will walk by it deciding that it's a trash work of some street painter so do not judge before trying to understand it in the end i think it's a must for every one with open minds still my <UNK> remains the <UNK> redemption and remember that not all things can be put in frames because there are things in this world that any frame just won't fit
<START> as you all may know jigsaw did not make its way to <UNK> because of a member of full <UNK> own staff <UNK> hamilton <UNK> is the one who sells to all of the video chains he recently released a movie bleed which he was selling to <UNK> at the same time as jigsaw he convinced the <UNK> <UNK> not to take any jigsaw and double the number of bleed the result is that jigsaw looks like a flop and bleed looks like a hit the major problem with that is that bleed is one of the worst movies ever and as we all know jigsaw is well gold i urge all of you to go on to the bleed page on the internet and vote for the movie that <UNK> jigsaw and all of your talents likewise you should go to the jigsaw page and cast high votes for it if you already haven't we need to get jigsaw up to at least an 8 or 8 5 and bleed down to around a 2 thus putting it on the <UNK> 100 worst movie listing also try to convince friends and family to do the same br br hope you all are doing well matt
<START> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a great movie not only in the year it was shot but also now it's an art movie which is not outdated even in 21st century the director <UNK> a good narrative skill and thus made the story so smooth br br the movie reminds me of the later french new wave movie <UNK> <UNK> femme <UNK> <UNK> which is of the similar topic
<START> the first part of grease with john travolta and olivia <UNK> john is one of the best movie for teens this one is a very bad copy the change is only in the sex in the first one the good one was sandy here it's michael i prefer to watch the first grease
<START> maybe i'm missing something because i've read more positive things about the man who cheated himself than i have read bad reviews and i just don't get it i like my <UNK> to have a little style to them with characters that speak look and act like <UNK> bogart in the big sleep or gene tierney in laura none of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it take the lead actor lee j <UNK> his <UNK> rolled out of bed look is about as far from the dashing smooth talking noir <UNK> as you'll find or take jane <UNK> as the femme fatale as another example this is one of the worst cases of <UNK> i've seen in a while she's just not convincing in the role br br as for the plot it's tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre i could have predicted the outcome of the man who cheated himself after about five minutes and that final cat and mouse chase scene is plain old dull ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it
<START> the movie may be great i just watched it last night but feel unable to give an honest opinion of it because i read the book first the book is so much better than the movie that i was disappointed with the film if you plan to watch of human bondage don't read the book beforehand on the other hand the book is so good and contains so much more than the love affair phillip has with mildred you could still enjoy it after seeing the movie i do not make this claim lightly i average reading a book every 4 days and read such <UNK> authors as <UNK> steel <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and shakespeare of human bondage gets my vote as one of the top ten novels ever written
<START> this movie is poorly conceived poorly acted and poorly written br br jon <UNK> is terribly annoying and cannot escape the same <UNK> dynamite routine self obsessed and ignorant br br furthermore diane keaton plays the same <UNK> overly obsessed mother who cares too much and yet not nearly enough about the lives of her children see because i said so br br anna <UNK> though i generally like her plays a vapid idiot in this film as well br br jeff daniels is passable but nothing special br br please skip this film if you want to keep your soul
<START> i just want to say that this production is very one sided breaks the <UNK> needed if you want to be taken seriously br br there are no credits of the persons they interviewed so you cant have an idea if they are worthy of being heard br br tells the story from just one point of view to do this is very dangerous because the next generations learns the bad idea and thats why wars keep coming i know this is not the only reason about wars but doesn't help either br br you can watch this documentary but read in the internet a lot before <UNK> are complex as human history is
<START> a good film with strong performances especially the two leads the film is about two american girls who are caught with 6 <UNK> heroin on an airport in thailand they're both thrown in prison and one of them signs a confession bill <UNK> plays the lawyer who tries to get them out all they have to do is find a nick parks who put the <UNK> in the bag of one of the two girls so far for the story which isn't that original it has many <UNK> with the better return to paradise br br the acting and <UNK> thomas <UNK> beautiful photography make this film worth to watch a 7 out of 10
<START> having just seen this on <UNK> it's fresh in my mind it's obvious that while the stooges are featured stars they don't really run the show first they're broken into 2 groups moe as <UNK> and larry and curly as a pair of <UNK> so there's not a whole lot of full team work the love story that <UNK> the plot is uninteresting the two ladies are the only ones with any acting ability there's another group of musical stooges that are unfunny unless you consider their attempts at being funny to be sadly <UNK> the music is tiresome they drive cars to the ranch and then depend on horses the <UNK> western wear is silly and there's an awful lot of the movie with no stooges on camera by the way this is obviously after <UNK> first stroke and his reduced energy level is clear <UNK> <UNK> appears early on in an uncredited role i loved everything these guys ever did including all the non <UNK> stuff but this little <UNK> is pretty lousy
<START> bizarre horror movie filled with famous faces but stolen by <UNK> raines later of tv's <UNK> road as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a <UNK> smile who is <UNK> to pay for her attempted <UNK> by <UNK> the <UNK> to hell the scenes with raines <UNK> are very well captured the mood music is perfect deborah <UNK> is charming as <UNK> pal but when raines moves into a creepy brooklyn heights <UNK> inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor things really start cooking the neighbors including a fantastically wicked burgess meredith and kinky couple sylvia miles beverly <UNK> are a diabolical lot and eli <UNK> is great fun as a <UNK> police detective the movie is nearly a cross <UNK> of rosemary's baby and the exorcist but what a combination based on the best <UNK> by jeffrey <UNK> the sentinel is <UNK> spooky full of shocks brought off well by director michael winner who <UNK> a <UNK> downbeat ending with skill 1 2 from
<START> the last wave is never going to win over the mainstream audience it is a slow moving but fascinating film for those who are willing to go along with it an australian <UNK> lawyer is asked to take on the case of five <UNK> accused in the murder of one of their own all sorts of <UNK> and <UNK> soon pop up as the man's death involves a <UNK> issue that was not meant for white man's court and pretty soon the lawyer is having trouble <UNK> reality from fantasy it looks like the end of the world may be at hand and he and the <UNK> may know this but no one else does richard chamberlain as the lawyer is at his peak here david <UNK> a familiar face from several other australian flicks and a decent actor is one of the five <UNK> on trial the last wave is simply not for everyone anymore than is <UNK> both happen to have strange things falling from the sky check it out on a slow saturday night
<START> care bears movie 2 a new generation isn't at all a bad movie in fact i like it very much yes i admit the dialogue is corny and the story is a bit poorly told at times but <UNK> while very very dark is a convincing enough shape shifting villain and hadley kay did a superb job <UNK> him speaking of the voice acting it was great nothing wrong with it whatsoever the animation is colourful and some of the visuals particularly at the beginning were breathtaking the songs and score are lovely especially growing up and forever young the latter has always been my personal favourite of the two the care bears who i do like are adorable and the human children are well done too and the ending is a real <UNK> all in all harmless kiddie fun 8 10 <UNK> cox
<START> ok <UNK> this for original this mean rich old <UNK> leaves his estate to his adult children all of them <UNK> losers and two creepy servants provided they spend the week in his spooky old house what happens that night will surprise only those who haven't seen a movie or television show before after a string of murders in which the victims look like they're bleeding restaurant <UNK> we have a painfully obvious twist ending the cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their <UNK> there are also a few second <UNK> actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now as a result the film <UNK> all the drama and mystery of an episode of <UNK> i will give credit where it's due the closing scene is clever and amusing if you're still awake
<START> i honestly believe that anyone considering film making be subjected to this mind <UNK> failure like the films of edward wood jr in the '60s and '70s this film is a shining example of why real filmmakers <UNK> so much energy <UNK> scripts re editing their films and <UNK> their special effects until they finally look right this movie is also a decent argument for the <UNK> pre screening process if mr hines were forced to endure the honest reactions of an <UNK> audience perhaps he would have cut 75 or the walking running <UNK> scenes and edited this movie down to a more bearable 90 minutes br br film students should view this movie as an example of just how dangerous thinking their work is good enough can truly be every performance every line of dialog every digital effect every <UNK> effect indeed every frame of video expresses the danger of <UNK> for mere mediocrity a beginning filmmaker may find himself herself tempted from time to time to think at least i accomplished something or just finishing this will be an accomplishment in itself this movie will help them understand just how badly a film can turn out br br critics might also benefit from seeing this movie before they dub the latest summer entertainment the worst movie ever made br br beginning writers can learn from this film just how important <UNK> are and perhaps understand the necessity for <UNK> also beginning directors can learn the importance of a good screenplay and some degree of respect for just how hard it is to write a script that causes the audience to feel emotionally compelled through the story writers and directors who watch bad made for cable movies of the week and think i can do better than that can see get an idea from this movie how difficult it really is to produce even mediocre results br br i sincerely believe this movie can serve as an educational tool to beginning filmmakers particularly those entering the craft in this current post lucas and post spielberg environment there is a reason filmmakers such as these are <UNK> for their ability with special effects the war of the worlds illustrates clearly that not everyone can pull it off some can't even come close to it
<START> never viewed this film until recently on tcm and found this story concerning <UNK> and a small town which had to suffer with the nazi <UNK> of the local towns just like many other european cities for example <UNK> the first world war was over and people in this town were still suffering from their lost soldiers and the wounded which war always creates alexander knox <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> park returns from the war with a lost leg and was the former school teacher in town he was brought up a german and was not very happy with the polish people and they in turn did not fully accept him either as the hitler party grew to power <UNK> <UNK> desired to become a nazi in order to return and <UNK> this small polish town for their treatment towards him which was really all in his mind <UNK> hunt <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> played an outstanding role as a woman who lost her husband and was <UNK> involved with <UNK> <UNK> there are many flashbacks and some very real truths about how the nazi destroyed people's families and their entire lives the cattle cars are shown in this picture with jewish people heading to the nazi gas <UNK> if you have not seen this film and like this subject matter give it some of your time this film is very down to earth for a 1944 film and a story you will not forget too quickly
<START> i watched this movie at <UNK> clock in the morning a time in the day where i am usually very open when it comes to movies but still i think it wasn't good this movie wasn't good at all the reasons why are many br br the acting isn't all that good and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a poor 90's chevy chase comedy i mean come on like the <UNK> situation and the poker situation amongst the servants this movie was so obviously based very much on the first one and thats ok but if i hadn't seen the first one before seeing this it would have sucked even worse like the ending it came very suddenly and i felt like i got no closure what so ever sebastian changed very suddenly and this this movie seems like it was made solely to explain <UNK> 1 and like no time or effort was used on making anything else good the score is the same as in the first one and it didn't feel like a movie at all br br they should have handled the situations with more style and class but they didn't and therefore this movie turned out bad
<START> i'm glad some people liked this but i hated this film it had a very good idea for a story line but that's where it ended it was badly written badly acted and badly made br br it had some interesting plot points but they were just <UNK> over too fast the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits like lying about why she was kidnapped and <UNK> the <UNK> instead it was what's going on 5 seconds later they tell you br br this film had no suspense and i was bored from start to end i just wanted it to finish br br go and rent misery or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end
<START> back in 1985 i caught this thing i can't even call it a movie on cable i was in college and i was with a high school friend whose <UNK> were raging out of control i figured out early on that this was hopeless stupid script a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women bad acting with one exception and pathetic jokes the <UNK> female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while but even he was bored after 30 minutes in remember this was a high school boy this was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the internet and such we kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened the funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap one poster had a fictional review that said this is the best movie i've seen this afternoon only grant <UNK> in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business no budget and boring t a skip it
<START> great <UNK> sex revealing and sexy and plenty of it ignore the <UNK> who doesn't realize that raunchy is sexy if done the right way if you erotic go watch that red shoes diary junk if you want hot and exciting <UNK> done properly this is the movie to watch if you like the more explicit <UNK> films you'll like this one great <UNK> sex revealing and sexy and plenty of it ignore the <UNK> who doesn't realize that raunchy is sexy if done the right way if you erotic go watch that red shoes diary junk if you want hot and exciting <UNK> done properly this is the movie to watch if you like the more explicit <UNK> films you'll like this one
<START> terrible movie <UNK> said br br these lines are just filler the movie was bad why i have to expand on that i don't know this is already a waste of my time i just wanted to warn others avoid this movie the acting sucks and the writing is just moronic bad in every way the only nice thing about the movie are <UNK> <UNK> breasts even that was ruined though by a terrible and <UNK> rape scene the movie is a poorly contrived and totally unbelievable piece of garbage br br ok now i am just going to <UNK> on imdb for this stupid rule of 10 lines of text minimum first i waste my time watching this <UNK> then feeling compelled to warn others i create an account with imdb only to discover that i have to write a <UNK> <UNK> on the film just to express how bad i think it is totally unnecessary
<START> sadly it's true <UNK> <UNK> exposes with absolute clarity the <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> failure br br as it was already said the author lost the <UNK> to <UNK> his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form <UNK> concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any <UNK> he only <UNK> a <UNK> pile of events unable to follow the least story line the <UNK> level is similar to a <UNK> <UNK> amateur play about the glorious <UNK> of <UNK> realism only turned upside down while the communist line <UNK> a narrow concern only with <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> now <UNK> is as <UNK> obsessed only with <UNK> and disgusting <UNK> the ideas content is zero and the message <UNK> and <UNK> at a <UNK> level br br unfortunately he also forgot the most <UNK> professional <UNK> he isn't able anymore to <UNK> a dramatic situation to order it in a correct movie scene to frame it right and to edit it following the <UNK> rules of cinematographic <UNK> his level of story telling in film images is similar to <UNK> something like holy sheet man it ain't <UNK> right <UNK> and all da people is <UNK> what a huge distance from the impressive artist of 1976 1984 who had created unique works as <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> <UNK> de <UNK> and even <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gloria <UNK>
<START> first of all as a long time student of the titanic disaster and member of several titanic <UNK> i feel entitled to comment on the film i don't really care how many awards and <UNK> the film won but to me it is still an absolutely awful film cameron had the resources to make a <UNK> semi documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a <UNK> faced romantic <UNK> the fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows to my mind the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love in fact most real events are anything but romantic and the titanic disaster certainly was not one i feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible i almost threw up in the last sequence where the <UNK> lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause is this an intelligent film ask yourself
<START> anyone who has said that it's better than hostel is talking complete crap believe me i'm not a fan of hostel but this is just ridiculous this is just another shot on camcorder straight to dvd low on ideas waste of your time i can't believe how many of these films there are and i'm yet to see a decent one in the 80's video <UNK> gore and horror movies were made with no budget but a great story and a load of new ideas and most importantly the heart and soul of the director who had something to say now they just seem to be <UNK> out in an attempt to trick people <UNK> in blockbuster to rent a copy until people stop doing this then i guess these films will keep appearing this film is so low on ideas it's just amazing how it ever got made the acting is also terrible the location completely unconvincing and the soundtrack is so annoying it <UNK> belief this waste of time has absolutely nothing going for it unless you're on a quest to <UNK> a list of the worst movies of all time my best worst part of the film is when a female character is pointing a gun at someone and threatening to shoot them if they don't back off you can see that she isn't even covering the trigger with her finger just holding the grip an absolute joke
<START> although most americans have little knowledge of his work other than star wars alec guinness produced an amazing body of work particularly in the 1940s 1950s ranging from dramas to quirky comedies i particularly love his comedies as they are so well done and seem so natural and real on the screen far different from the usual fare from hollywood br br this being said this was the film that <UNK> my interest in these movies it's plot was so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhere except for ealing studios which had a particular <UNK> for little films like this one br br guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a <UNK> company he wants to experiment in order to create a <UNK> fabric that is <UNK> though he is not working for the company as a <UNK> but for <UNK> work so he tends to sneak into <UNK> either during the day if no one suspects or at night and try his hand at <UNK> repeatedly he is caught such as after he blew up the lab and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds then despite the importance of the discovery he sets off a completely <UNK> chain of events and then the fun begins br br the film is a wonderful satire that <UNK> fun at industry <UNK> the government and people in general
<START> this rather poorly named western series won an emmy for best <UNK> program and is certainly an interesting series it was produced by republic the studio which did action better than anyone and they put their best into it each episode was built around a real historical figure of the old west a <UNK> detective named matt clark similar to the later elliot <UNK> with the gangsters of the <UNK> and 30's managed to become involved with almost every notorious western outlaw between the middle of the <UNK> and wwi the <UNK> best asset was jim davis tall rugged <UNK> good looking in prime shape with an authentic western accent and great riding skills which made him utterly convincing in the action scenes davis was every inch the western hero he was teamed with two lovely and active co stars mary castle as frankie during the first season and <UNK> miller as <UNK> during the second each worked well with davis br br what separated this show from its <UNK> and much of what came later was the <UNK> invested in the action scenes ace action <UNK> william <UNK> directed 30 episodes franklin <UNK> the rest both filmed the action with polish <UNK> vast store of stock footage from serials and <UNK> was <UNK> to give scope the level of individual episodes rose or fell with the quality of the guest stars brought in to the play the <UNK> among the really good ones were marie <UNK> as belle <UNK> lee van <UNK> as jesse james <UNK> parker as <UNK> dalton jean parker as cattle kate and joe <UNK> and slim <UNK> as butch <UNK> and the <UNK> kid the cream of the western up and <UNK> <UNK> parker denver <UNK> james best and richard <UNK> <UNK> their craft b veterans with decades of experience under their <UNK> harry woods glenn strange kenneth macdonald <UNK> <UNK> steve <UNK> and chief <UNK> provided the old leather feel of vintage westerns br br the weakness of the concept was that there are only so many famous western <UNK> by the second season the famous figures were becoming a <UNK> obscure for all by the most dedicated history buff nevertheless a few of the later shows were a match for any due to the guest stars henry brandon portrayed <UNK> <UNK> champion and former republic star don barry was outstanding as small time outlaw <UNK> sharp br br western fans or history buffs will want to see this
<START> i won't repeat all that has been said already by other viewers of this film br br in my opinion this is an excellent film not only as a very human tale of the developing relationship between a father and his grown up son but also as a little window onto the world of <UNK> islam for those like me who are not very familiar with that religion br br an important aspect of this story is that of the young man's relation to his father's beliefs and practices and how his attitude towards the religion seems to alter in subtle ways as we progress on their journey with them br br this is a very thought provoking enjoyable and well made film that i would recommend to anyone with brain and heart
<START> where to even start the horrendous acting the nonsensical plot the bargain basement effects the completely <UNK> characters the choppy editing the headache inducing <UNK> keyboard score the embarrassingly racist remarks watch it charlie back off jackie chan the constant <UNK> i am a <UNK> horror fan and i have no problem at all with the current torture <UNK> trend of movies however this is a poorly made piece of garbage i think i suffered more pain watching this than the characters did dying in it if you like girls being forced to eat stir fried penis really poor soft core porn and think lines like i'm gonna find that b and <UNK> her c shut are clever live feed is for you br br as for me i feel the need to go wash my eyes out with <UNK> <UNK> to prevent from ever seeing this movie again
<START> before i comment on this movie i just watched on youtube i have to admit that the reason i checked this out was to <UNK> something i first saw on the tv ads in 1980 barbara <UNK> <UNK> and since the movie received an r rating i expected to see her nude alas no <UNK> for her or of the other gorgeous actress that appeared here <UNK> <UNK> who's supposed to be a teen but was actually 20 when she made this seeing her in a <UNK> and <UNK> and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as <UNK> as ms bach they provide some of the scattered laughs this movie provides in fact i don't blame ron <UNK> for having his name removed from the credits since his role as the tight <UNK> <UNK> is pretty embarrassing though i did like the seduction scene he did with ms <UNK> this also happens to be the debut of ralph <UNK> who's the loner among the <UNK> sent to an academy school the others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and ms bach an arab who <UNK> <UNK> oil and a <UNK> son who loves his girlfriend candy <UNK> character so much he risks <UNK> in the middle of the night see her in the girls academy among the supporting cast tom <UNK> plays a <UNK> character named <UNK> who i found partly amusing with a screenplay by tom <UNK> and jay <UNK> and direction by robert downey sr whose son robert downey jr has a cameo early on in a soccer scene up the academy is uneven with the politically incorrect humor but unless you're really offended at the <UNK> and sexual content this is actually a pretty harmless comedy that mad magazine and its trademark cover boy alfred e newman shouldn't be ashamed of even though they once had their name and character taken off the picture p s another one of the <UNK> was harry <UNK> who was born in my birth town of chicago ill he played rodney <UNK> he also says one of my favorite lines i'm trying to come
<START> i bought this dvd for <UNK> and now i realise why the acting was the worst i've seen in a long time the lighting and sound are shoddy at best the plot makes little sense even when sober warning i don't advise watching this film when sober this film feels like you're watching the home movie of someone who doesn't get out much it really is a shame that all the very little money spent on this project went to such a waste i look forward to seeing if any of those <UNK> still have a career other than eva longoria who is the only star of this film that was apparently not hit with the bad acting stick i'm sorry that none of this criticism seems <UNK> but i will say one thing to james <UNK> don't try it again in the words of <UNK> its severely lacking in the good department
<START> this is my kind of film i am fascinated by strange psychotic nightmares and this movie is just that but it is also a dark comedy while i see it mostly as a horror thriller there will be others who might see it as a black dramatic comedy br br but either way it is a fascinating descent into madness the ending caught me off guard but what an ending it leaves the viewer a lot to think about br br powerful performances a complex and detailed plot a great script filled with dread and <UNK> of humor and an eerie atmosphere make this a film worth watching br br personally i think that i will need to watch this several more times to pick up and understand all the subtleties that are within but it is such a film that it will be a pleasure and not a chore so to do
<START> not an altogether bad start for the program but what a slap in the face to real law <UNK> the worst part of the series is that it attempts to bill itself as reality fare and is anything but men and women that <UNK> their lives to the <UNK> of laws deserve better than this what is next medical school in a minute <UNK> performing <UNK> charles <UNK> <UNK> on a hip replacement c'mon show a little respect even the citizens of <UNK> are outing the program as staged police academy high school gym poor editing how many times can they use the car to car shot of the <UNK> bell in the background cheesy <UNK> effects the same loop added ad <UNK> to every <UNK> whether rolling code or not and last but not least more officer safety issues than you could shake a stick at br br if i want to see <UNK> police work and wise ass fake cops i would watch reno <UNK>
<START> what was this about pre destination you can not change the future cause it has already been written br br i'll give it this much i did want to see what happened next and therefore watched the whole movie this movie took a concept and made it watchable br br if you're looking for a recommendation see it at <UNK> <UNK> no thrills but an interesting concept they should have left the <UNK> reference out
<START> i don't remember a movie where i have cared less about where the characters have come from what happens to them or where they are going i realize that hollywood's greatest <UNK> is <UNK> <UNK> but these people are either too despicable or too boring to take up time with for what it's worth though the discussion that followed the showing under the <UNK> of the key sunday cinema series did make <UNK> that possibly the three women did show some redeeming characteristics i disagree
<START> i've just visited russian forum of our tv channel that had showed this film well 99 per <UNK> of active russian audience is disappointed we wanted to see more true facts of our space achievements in this film but authors had in mind something else we are big and beautiful country with intelligent people living here we are proud of all our space dreams real achievements on the one hand in this field and in science on the other hand so i'd like to ask authors where is our <UNK> and where the hell our <UNK> station ah i'm quite sure that <UNK> events took place much earlier <UNK> walk on moon and to comment numerous technical and science mistakes i really have no time and enough space here se our <UNK> critics in russian forum on www <UNK> <UNK>
<START> <UNK> all <UNK> is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that it's set in new york which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from ben <UNK> and the late john ritter who is superb and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn the film is a light and <UNK> romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by <UNK> who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller <UNK> eccentric <UNK> novak the films co producer and john ritter basically the <UNK> falls for a rich <UNK> <UNK> wife hepburn and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy <UNK> who sadly murdered <UNK> after production <UNK> all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans
<START> this movie scared me so bad i am easily scared though so its no big thing but this movie was scary and whoever <UNK> scared by this movie im surprised because everyone i know said it was scary i hope everyone sees it but dont see it with the lights off like i did
<START> i married a japanese woman 14 years ago we're still together br br however in the 1950's it would never have been as easy br br life in the military had been <UNK> for action drama and comedy for years by this point <UNK> to death the mixed relationships gave it new ground to cover this is old hat today but then marrying an asian back then meant you either <UNK> somebody something or you were a freak of some sort this touched on both possibilities along with the third maybe it is love br br brando did his usual good job garner did a better job than he usually does he's good but this showed how good he could be <UNK> chan had a <UNK> debut here and while i think she earned her statue she didn't really stretch it was a role that no one who hadn't been overseas would have recognized and the <UNK> was the <UNK> br br the real scene <UNK> was red buttons red was the best thing in this film bank on it and the japanese <UNK> were shown in an admirable light as well br br a classic
<START> nifty little episode played mainly for laughs but with clever <UNK> of suspense somehow a martian has <UNK> aboard a broken down bus on its way to nowhere but which passenger is it talk about your illegal immigrants all star supporting cast from wild eyed jack <UNK> <UNK> it up shamelessly to sexy jean <UNK> if she's the martian then i say let's open the borders to cruel faced john <UNK> the most obvious suspect along with familiar faces john archer and barney phillips and a nice turn from bill <UNK> as the bus driver makes for a very entertaining half hour even if the action is confined to a single set
<START> i am glad to read so many negative comments about the <UNK> plot everyone i talk to says the same thing they like <UNK> gruff nature and his intelligence but really dislike the <UNK> of this continuing plot it cuts into the real nature of the hospital story and makes everyone angry at police authority it needs to have a more caring nature instead of the <UNK> to everyone at the hospital also there seems to be many questionable legal aspects to what <UNK> is actually doing he alone cannot freeze accounts and have the authority to stop doctors from writing <UNK> for patients a lot of the <UNK> he is showing also is hurting the very sick patients at the hospital and the is not a good storyline to portray i voted the episode awful not because of the story itself but when you insert the <UNK> piece it turns me off and the rest of the plot gets hurt by it people say they hate to watch the story lines anymore please change it get <UNK> out
<START> in director <UNK> <UNK> vivah 20 something <UNK> boy shahid <UNK> finds himself smitten by the <UNK> small town girl his father has selected for him to marry drawn to her innocence and simplicity shahid agrees to the marriage barely moments after he's met her at her home in <UNK> and the young lady in question amrita <UNK> seems equally <UNK> by her charming <UNK> the marriage is fixed for six months later and the couple find themselves in the first <UNK> of young budding love their <UNK> distance notwithstanding but amrita who's been raised by her uncle and her aunt after her parents' death is struck by a horrible <UNK> just hours before the marriage and then it's up to shahid to play the <UNK> lover and to embrace her <UNK> much in the same vein as hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> new film vivah too is on one level a family drama with an extremely idealistic premise but sadly the plot of this new film comes off looking way too outdated even more far fetched than those <UNK> <UNK> kapoor <UNK> and the problem is clear  you just can't relate to such <UNK> clean characters who don't have one bad bone in their bodies there are many things that work in favour of and against hindi films and timing is one such important factor twenty five years ago perhaps the plot of vivah may not have felt like such a stretch but today it just seems like the product of a mind stuck in a time <UNK> perhaps the film's only saving grace is the fact that it <UNK> sincerity from start to finish you can make out right away that the <UNK> intention is not to <UNK> judging both by <UNK> previous films and by closely <UNK> this new one you can safely <UNK> that <UNK> believes in a perfect world he believes in his good as gold characters he believes that large families can live together happily under the same roof without the slightest <UNK> but alas he's unable to translate his vision to the screen it's difficult to overlook how one dimensional his protagonists are  shahid and amrita both <UNK> and <UNK>  i mean think about it the first time they hold hands is an hour and twenty minutes into the film <UNK> may think he's returning to his <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> roots with vivah but truth is that the reason we <UNK> salman and <UNK> in that film or even salman and <UNK> in hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is because they had such fantastic chemistry because although they were created out of the same <UNK> as shahid and amrita in vivah those <UNK> had <UNK> and <UNK> shahid and amrita are just insipid and boring for a film that relies so heavily on music to <UNK> its story the filmmaker chooses a string of 70s style tunes that only further <UNK> the film's <UNK> pace but if i had to choose just one reason to explain why vivah doesn't work for me it's because i'm not sure i can relate to any of the characters who inhabit <UNK> story to some perhaps vivah will give hope that a perfect world like this is actually out there somewhere but i'm a little cynical i guess so give me the <UNK> <UNK> of hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> give me the <UNK> salman of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> i'll even take that mischievous <UNK> kapoor of hum <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but save me from these <UNK> you know some <UNK> aren't made in heaven this one's vivah
<START> okay so i'm not a big video game buff but was the game house of the dead really famous enough to make a movie from sure they went as far as to actually put in quick video game clips throughout the movie as though <UNK> any particular scene of violence but there are dozens and dozens of games that look exactly the same with the hand in the bottom on the screen supposedly your own holding whatever weapon and goo ing all kinds of aliens or walking dead or <UNK> or whatever the case may be br br it's an interesting premise in house of the dead with a lot of college kids loaded college kids as it were kids who are able to pay some <UNK> something like 1 500 just for a ride after they miss their boat trying to get out to this island for what is supposed to be the rave of the year the first thing that comes to mind about house of the dead after watching it is that it has become increasingly clear that modern horror movies have become nothing more than an exercise in coming up with creative ways to get a lot of scantily clad teenagers into exactly the same situations at least in this case the fact that they were on their way to a rave excuses the way the girls are dressed they look badly out of place running around the woods in cute little <UNK> tops but at least they thought they were dressed for the occasion br br clint howard <UNK> the most interesting character in the film by far delivers an absolutely awful performance the greatness of which <UNK> every other actor in the movie i can't stand it when well known actors change their accents in movies it is so rarely effective and howard here shows that it is equally flat to have an well known actor pretend that he's this hardened <UNK> with a <UNK> voice from years of breathing <UNK> air he didn't even <UNK> well it sounded like he was eating a <UNK> roll before shooting and accidentally <UNK> some <UNK> sugar or something real tough there clint i expected more from him but then again he did agree to a part in this mess br br once we get to the island the movie <UNK> turns into any one of the friday the 13th movies that took place at camp crystal lake lots of teenagers played by actors who were way too old for their parts getting naked and then killed the nudity was impressive i guess but let's consider something for a minute these kids pay almost two grand to get out to this island to go to the rave of the year find no one and say well who wants a beer even the guy who pulled that stack of hundreds out of his <UNK> to get them all over there didn't think anything of it that they found a full bar and not a single <UNK> person in sight here you have the <UNK> from director uwe boll there's alcohol they won't notice that the party they came for consists of no one but themselves br br so not only do they start drinking not <UNK> the fact that the whole party seems to have <UNK> the island but when one of the girls goes off into the dark woods to find out where everyone is dragging one other girl and one of the guys reluctantly along the guy and the girl who stay behind to get <UNK> decide that it would be a great idea to strip down for a <UNK> now that they're alone it's like they expected to find the island empty and now that they rest of the people that they came over with were gone for a little while they would have some <UNK> since there's no one else around brilliant br br now for the things that everyone hated judging by the reviews that i've read about the movie yes <UNK> shots from the video game into the movie mostly in order to show that yes the movie was being faithful to directly <UNK> the video game sure it was a stupid idea i can't imagine who thought up that little <UNK> but worse than that is the matrix style bullet time scenes that were thrown in over and over and over and over after the first time at which point i found it pretentious and cheesy for a movie like this to have a shot like that as though it was something original it is noticeable more for the technique of the shot itself rather than any dramatic meaning or creation of any kind of tension for the film br br one of the things that makes a zombie film scary and gets you on the edge of your seat is to have them slowly but relentlessly coming after the living humans who are much faster but getting tired running out of places to run and with a terrifying <UNK> of things with which to fight the zombies off with the first two are done right in the movie the kids are terrified and don't have a lot of places to run since they're on an island but since they caught a ride over with a <UNK> they find themselves heavily armed and i mean that very strongly i mean these people have everything from machine guns to hand <UNK> which <UNK> most of the tension of the impending walking dead br br then you have what i call the <UNK> slasher scene since the rave never happened and i guess since uwe boll thought people were going to be disappointed at not hearing any <UNK> music in the movie there's one scene right in the middle where all the humans are fighting off the living dead and amazingly enough it turns into something of a music video there's <UNK> music <UNK> as the shots are edited together faster and faster until it's nothing but a <UNK> of gory shot mostly only about 5 frames long which is about 1 6 of a second flashing across the screen in time with the speed <UNK> music clever i guess but it has no place in a horror movie because it completely <UNK> any sense of <UNK> or tension of even the gross out effect because you can't see any one thing for long enough to react to it you're just watching these shots fly across the screen and wondering what the hell the director was thinking when he decided that it would be a good idea to put something like this in the movie br br i've seen a lot of people compare this movie to resident evil mostly claiming that it copies the premise of it and they're exactly right i appreciate that at least here as was not the case in resident evil it wasn't some man made virus that turned people into walking dead that were able to <UNK> other people changing them the way vampires turn others into vampires 28 days later was also clearly an inspiration for this movie it's just too bad that house of the dead didn't do a single original thing except for the somewhat moronic idea of putting in quick shots of the video game on which it is based just in case you forget i really think that this should have been a much better movie while obviously i can't say that i know much about the game it's based on just the title and the movie poster deserve a much better movie but unfortunately i think that's more often the case than not with horror movies it's really kind of sad when a movie comes out that is so obviously advertised as a no holds <UNK> horror film and the scariest thing in the entire movie is the closing shot which suggests the possibility of a sequel
<START> i have not seen many low budget films i must admit but this is the worst movie ever probably the main character the old man talked like he had a <UNK> and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds a 5 year old could act better the story had the most awful plot and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was and hoped it was leading onto the real movie i cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight i think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman i think the only thing ok with the budget was the make up but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit awful simply awful
<START> some fraud girl tries to compete in the big <UNK> of <UNK> by <UNK> places with her brother she gets to the top by lying and manipulation she should have been <UNK> the movie <UNK> lying and cheating to win also the idea of a 9 <UNK> old mechanic is absurd it takes many many years to get good go back to the <UNK> toys
<START> this starts off bad what with the three women acting like <UNK> junior high school <UNK> sitting around <UNK> with their <UNK> endless <UNK> and a <UNK> chocolate treat for the one who tells the best <UNK> story and then it gets worse spoiler alert what with <UNK> character falling for the young <UNK> player who used to be her student when he was 14 she's the <UNK> of an english school believe it or not only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch from hell <UNK> and then from there it's basically unwatchable <UNK> she <UNK> her <UNK> and has the <UNK> <UNK> love child and the 3 women end up as they started drinking more <UNK> and smoking more <UNK> blah blah blah <UNK> character throws the <UNK> <UNK> out in the street in a pathetic attempt to <UNK> growth have mercy
<START> personally i enjoyed cut <UNK> it was the first time i've seen a <UNK> release australian slasher flick a genre normally <UNK> to the mainstream hollywood films br br with all the usual <UNK> comedies and dramas coming out of australia i loved being able to see a <UNK> horror movie that wasn't a rip off of anything i didn't even think it was really a spoof of other movies it was a <UNK> theme horror like nightmare on elm street not scream or i know what you did last summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief i think it's about time australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres br br cut was original scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun i'd give it seven out of ten and wouldn't treat it as anything serious it did what i expected it to do entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying i enjoyed it
<START> this movie is hilarious the problem is that it's not a comedy one classic scene involves kurt thomas just happening to find a <UNK> horse in the middle of a village square which he uses to <UNK> the bad guys another is the trek into the village of <UNK> too bad this movie wasn't made to be a farce or it may have gotten better ratings
<START> i went to see evening because of the cast i'd gone to see <UNK> room for that reason that movie offering diane keaton <UNK> de <UNK> and also meryl streep and had loved every minute of it same for the <UNK> even though it was chick <UNK> <UNK> and my feeling was anything offering performances by vanessa redgrave meryl streep patrick wilson and glenn close would be at least as good instead i found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite simplistic and on one occasion truly offensive material br br now i had no problem with the way the film was structured i actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time to tell a story so long as one era <UNK> the other and <UNK> <UNK> but while <UNK> character being on her <UNK> and <UNK> a past event she felt was a mistake was riveting at times the part actually showing what that past mistake was does nothing to <UNK> the matter in fact it makes it seem meaningless in the <UNK> girl meets boy girl gets boy girl loses boy fashion and in the most unbelievable clichéd wrong headed way possible br br and from here be spoilers so bear that in mind should you continue reading br br first of all claire danes was brutally miscast not only does she not even begin to resemble vanessa redgrave as a young woman she has nowhere near the chops when it comes to acting don't get me wrong she can be good in the right role just not this one and patrick wilson was miscast though he has the acting chops to almost pull it off he'd have been better suited to the part hugh <UNK> played the rich confused <UNK> and not the object of sexual attraction to one and all he's a bit too <UNK> y for that hugh <UNK> one note i'm a tortured drunk and wait till you find out why and the why i'm a closet case in a sexually repressed world so i have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone i know was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died as you knew he would because that's the only thing that can happen to a <UNK> in the fifties so ludicrous wrong headed and <UNK> i nearly threw my candy at the screen br br as for the modern part between toni collette and her sister her fear of commitment her jealousy of her sister's perfect life her sister wondering if she's made the right choices her <UNK> and her too perfect boyfriend which actually might have been more interesting and meaningful if played by patrick wilson and <UNK> moss <UNK> might have been a more interesting harris given his dreamy eyes anyway all this was <UNK> over in the 70's and 80's and in much greater depth do we really have to present it again and all as if it was fresh and <UNK> br br and to top it off meryl streep doesn't even appear until the last ten minutes of the movie all in old lady makeup that hides many of her facial expressions she's still good but only because she's meryl and meryl can find a way to pull off even the <UNK> dialog under the <UNK> of makeup br br so to put it simply this movie has every cliché in the really meaningful message movie book and it adds a few that really had no business being <UNK> out again at two hours long and laced with lifetime movie of the week music that is guaranteed to rub you raw it's a complete failure in both the meaningful and <UNK> aspects i give it 3 only because of meryl and vanessa br br now if all you require from your films is <UNK> le then please set my comments about evening aside and have the time of your life but if you want a truly meaningful experience being served up by great actors and filmmakers who know what to do with a simple story about life and death and all the nonsense it brings rent <UNK> room and find out what truly great acting is
<START> ok i am blessed i have seen two very strong stage productions the one in new york with the original cast and another at the san diego <UNK> <UNK> reynolds and <UNK> <UNK> you rock compared to either of these the movie is almost unwatchable i've been plodding through the dvd for the past two <UNK> and am still not finished way too much <UNK> dialog and <UNK> too many added scenes and people yes the four major performances are quite good <UNK> ms <UNK> but comparing stage to film is definitely an example of less is more the <UNK> of the play to satisfy film <UNK> need for <UNK> variety and <UNK> was a poor choice please please please go find a stage production somewhere near you
<START> this film is <UNK> famous as one of the most horrible examples of propaganda ever produced the <UNK> <UNK> of jews with disease is simply br br <UNK> and even worse it almost becomes believable for brief seconds br br through its sheer <UNK> the fact that something this crude works even br br briefly is an object lesson in itself you have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this and i wouldn't recommend trying unless you have a good reason
<START> tv movie about an ancient egyptian curse brought to the us in the <UNK> during the filming of <UNK> first version of the 10 <UNK> and which is <UNK> when <UNK> sets are <UNK> in the desert br br one of the worst films i've seen in a long time br br the question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film if this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness if its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons you will laugh long and hard at this film probably more than many other hollywood comedies
<START> this is just a <UNK> of a wonderful story by <UNK> <UNK> this movie doesn't follow the storyline in the book and there are so many inconsistencies with the original movie that you have to wonder if the screenwriter had even seen the first movie br br al pacino the original and still the best carlito gets out of prison at the start of the original one here carlito <UNK> with his woman in paradise br br what happened to <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> in this installment she isn't mentioned and carlito <UNK> with and presumably will marry some other girl br br also where is <UNK> i think he was in the first book br br i also like how mr <UNK> plays a totally different character in this film he was <UNK> back in the pacino days now he is <UNK> <UNK> a killer from cuba i remember that <UNK> <UNK> had a much bigger role in the book br br it's been a while since i read the book but where did sean <UNK> character come from also i think this movie really <UNK> over the racial tensions in harlem that <UNK> was writing about and the mob doesn't get the treatment that they did in the book they are also wiped out in this movie but magically the pleasant <UNK> bunch is around for the second movie br br the book told a great story this movie could have told a great story this is just a huge disappointment read the book it's a better use of your time
<START> there is nothing cool hip or clever about this film liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema how can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean ugly people are serial killers if they have to <UNK> total strangers in order to be a family again then we don't want them to be a family what part of that did you have trouble <UNK> why applaud this filth br br this silly filth is what you do if you can't do art one's head life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow <UNK> as interesting this is a camera without a brain what really makes an artwork cool is <UNK> questioning the status <UNK> from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history or in this case a knowledge of anything would be <UNK> instead this is just randomly <UNK> up the <UNK> images available in a world in <UNK> thanks to just the sort of empty <UNK> <UNK> as cool cause it's so far out man these same violent events actually happen every day they are not just in the film they refer to actual soul less people who would do those same things to you do you want those things done to you a child could have thought this up it required zero imagination it is not <UNK> this lazy crap has no content is saying nothing it's just the worst of the evening news it is saying nothing new nothing we don't already know it's the <UNK> new clothes the director hoping there are enough <UNK> children proud of their streak of <UNK> for this sloppy filth to fly i can see director miike's demented fans now chain smoking teens and <UNK> <UNK> covered in <UNK> with metal hanging from holes <UNK> in their faces their knowledge base <UNK> <UNK> to their intelligence <UNK> of themselves br br there is no plot to this it is just sheer exploitation of shock value violence there is no hidden meaning anywhere in this poorly made film it is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are <UNK> artistic but you cannot <UNK> a hidden meaning if one is not there to do that you need to view review a real piece of cinema there are plenty out there directed by fellini bergman fassbinder <UNK> altman <UNK> kurosawa lynch <UNK> peter <UNK> tarantino <UNK> del toro richard <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> gus van <UNK> soderbergh <UNK> <UNK> why don't you view a real art film by the likes of these giants this wannabe director miike will never make a film equal to one of the geniuses i just listed because he just doesn't have the talent anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like visitor q teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon there's no message no meaning no plot nothing to it at all there are long lists of art films to learn from but this visitor q is not an art film in any respect it has no content to it it's just one banal horror <UNK> onto another and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things happen every single day somewhere in the world they are not okay because they are just in the film they refer to actual soul less people who would do those same things to you do you want those things done to you to others why because this world is already ugly enough thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this br br there are <UNK> many art films out there to use your mind to <UNK> but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap there is no deeper meaning there is nothing to analyze why keep trying i've spent nearly 40 years watching practically every film ever made and keeping up with all the new ones but i've never seen anything as <UNK> pointless as this it's not imaginative or even shocking because these types of events happen daily all over the world to make this film or even to <UNK> review it has caused over 50 young <UNK> who don't know any better to think it's cool they may grow up thinking that convincing others some of whom may end up doing these things convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way by being <UNK> to the horror of this gruesome <UNK> trust me on this i know cool and cool this piece of crap ain't visitor q has the feel of a genuine snuff film and i'm still not sure it isn't actually br br your actions have consequences son the world is awful enough already some violence like this could happen to you or to the socially irresponsible director who <UNK> out this fake art film believe me you won't be thinking it's cool when someone is <UNK> your skull in half
<START> i absolutely loved this movie it met all expectations and went beyond that i loved the humor and the way the movie wasn't just randomly silly it also had a message jim carrey makes me happy
<START> this is a cgi animated film based upon a french <UNK> animated series the series ran briefly on cartoon network but its run was so brief that its inclusion as one of the potential oscar <UNK> for best animated film for this year left most people i know going huh this is the story of <UNK> <UNK> the kind heart muscle and <UNK> the brains of the operation who along with hector their fire <UNK> dragon he's more like a dog travel the world offering up their services as dragon hunters but never getting paid into their lives comes <UNK> the fairy tale loving niece of a king who is going blind it seems the world is being <UNK> by a huge monster and all of the knights the king has sent out have never returned or if the do return they come back as <UNK> in desperation the king hires the dragon hunters to stop the world eater <UNK> of course <UNK> along br br what can i say other then why is this film hiding under a rock this is a really good little film that is completely off the radar except as unlikely oscar <UNK> its a beautifully designed fantastic looking film the world it takes place has floating lands and crazy creatures that constantly had me going wow at it the english voice cast with forrest <UNK> as <UNK> <UNK> one of the best vocal performances i've ever heard and rob <UNK> as <UNK> think steve <UNK> is first rate equally great is the script which doesn't talk down to its audience using some real expressions not normally heard in animated films not disney nor pixar its all really well done br br is it perfect no some of the bits go on too long but at the same time its is damn entertaining br br if you get the chance see this its one of the better animated films from 2008 and is going on my nice surprise list for 2009
<START> no spoilers br br i love horror movies but this has got to be the <UNK> attempt to make one ever calling it a movie is also a stretch this random clips of obviously fake and tacky violence and an ugly woman trying to act sexy edited poorly together is not worth watching br br watching this is about as interesting watching as some random family's holiday pictures and it has about the same quality you would expect when you send your ten year old son into the woods with your new <UNK> <UNK> and tell him to make a movie br br terrible
<START> ok so the fx are not high budget but this story is based on actual events not something thrown together to make a couple of rich actors even <UNK> as most movies that are based on books there are somethings that just don't fit only a couple of people have stated that this movie was based on real events not a knock off as most people believe it is this movie is in no way related too <UNK> other than both movies are about <UNK> br br for those of you who have problems with the science of the <UNK> and <UNK> in the movie there are a couple of things you need to remember the actual night of the <UNK> was june 3 1980 so this movie was released 16 years after the actual events try think how far storm research has advanced in that time it happened in a larger town grand island <UNK> is the third largest city in the state even though the movie calls the town something else and says it's a small town for the real story check out http www <UNK> com
<START> while the 3 d animation the highlight of the show did it's job well most other elements fell flat it was as though the filmmakers thought well it's gonna be 3 d so we don't have to work that hard on the plot or character development and the fact that it's a children's movie is absolutely no excuse the public is drawn to three dimensional characters shrek <UNK> dad just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics the only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional <UNK> who twists the plot from time to time with his <UNK> to eat everything in sight br br and the absolute <UNK> buzz <UNK> appearance at the very end after watching a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and half comes on the screen and ruins everyone's good time by calling the film's main characters <UNK> and <UNK> that the situation put forth on screen was actually an <UNK> br br did you just wanna tell the kids the <UNK> bunny and santa claus don't exist while you're at it
<START> four tales of terror regarding the events at a creepy old mansion are <UNK> to <UNK> scotland yard investigator <UNK> john bennett as he <UNK> the <UNK> of the latest <UNK> of the house that <UNK> blood br br one can only struggle to find the words to describe the true brilliance that is <UNK> house that <UNK> <UNK> this seventies horror anthology is quite remarkable in the way that such a visually innocent movie is capable of inducing horror in even the most <UNK> of viewers incredibly the number of depictions of violence on screen can be counted on one hand but the film is still able to portray brutality and succeeds in <UNK> up the most horrific images in the viewers own imagination all the while <UNK> from taking the obvious route of graphic violence in a rare feature of early seventies horror the <UNK> of the movie are virtually flawless from the <UNK> performances of the star <UNK> cast featuring the legendary peter cushing christopher lee and ingrid pitt all the way to the superb direction and story telling courtesy of peter <UNK> and master of the macabre writer robert <UNK> the author of the novel <UNK> the only real complaints that one may have with <UNK> house that <UNK> <UNK> are the somewhat <UNK> plot twists at the end of the first two segments and the predictable ending of the picture but even these minor details fail to detract from the overall viewing enjoyment br br the first segment entitled <UNK> for <UNK> tells the story of charles <UNK> <UNK> elliott a horror author who <UNK> the creepy house while he works on his latest novel while working on the novel <UNK> continues to start seeing the murderous character from his story in and around the house and soon begins to question the difference between fiction and reality <UNK> performance in this piece is truly exceptional and his character is given a surprising air of believability the key to this segment as with the others is the mystery surrounding the events that take place the viewer is made to question whether the sight of the murderous character of dominic is merely a <UNK> a <UNK> disorder or whether the character is actually there <UNK> direction succeeds in creating an unsettling atmosphere coupled with a slow <UNK> approach to <UNK> the tension and suspense required to make the segment greatly enthralling br br the following segment features peter cushing as the new <UNK> of the sinister house during a trip into town he comes across a wax museum of horrors and decides to venture in while there he discovers a wax model of a beautiful woman that seems all too familiar to him <UNK> character philip is then joined by his friend <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who also wishes to visit the museum much to the <UNK> of philip in this segment the viewer is given no more than very subtle clues as to the mystery of the wax woman but in general the viewer is left in the dark there is far less tension to this particular story yet the segment still succeeds in maintaining its air of mystery through a particularly harrowing dream sequence and the general ambiguity of the story <UNK> direction is once again exceptional and while this is quite possibly the weakest of the four stories there is no denying that through some creative direction and credible acting <UNK> is still a delightful entry into the film br br <UNK> is followed by what is in my opinion the greatest of the four segments  <UNK> to the <UNK> christopher lee stars as john reid the father to a young girl who to begin with has an inexplicable fear of fire which is soon <UNK> by caring <UNK> ann norton <UNK> dawn porter however john appears to be <UNK> a dark secret about the family <UNK> to the <UNK> is easily the most sober and intricate of the four stories and that is why the segment is undeniably compelling to the viewer throughout the segment small and subtle clues are released about the truth behind the family but it is not until the immensely horrific final scene that everything <UNK> neatly into place this is the best example of how <UNK> used dramatic tension and suspense to create the foreboding atmosphere that made the entire film great accompanied by a wonderfully arranged soundtrack <UNK> to the <UNK> is an exercise in <UNK> fear that grabs the viewer by the throat and refuses to let go until the <UNK> screams that end this piece finally <UNK> personally i believe that this short segment would have made an entertaining and haunting feature length movie and i would give this segment a rare 10 10 br br the film is ended with the story surrounding the missing performer that the investigator was originally interested in jon pertwee and ingrid pitt star as two performers who are currently working on a horror movie <UNK> character is disgusted with the amateurish production and props of the film and so he <UNK> his own vampire cloak from a strange shop of mysteries however strange things begin to happen when he wears the cloak and soon he begins to fear the worst this segment which places the inspector amongst the events is a nice way to wrap up a wonderful anthology although there is an <UNK> air of camp to the segment this is in a way what makes the story so enjoyable unfortunately there is little in this segment that could be <UNK> as frightening in any sense and the predictable ending could have been executed better but nonetheless the segment has its redeeming features horror buffs should definitely look out for <UNK> brief comment on bela <UNK> and christopher lee's portrayal of dracula this slightly comical and light hearted approach to the final segment is in essence an adequate and almost natural way of ending the picture even if it lets down the film when compared to the earlier examples of suspense driven horror br br to sum up <UNK> house that <UNK> <UNK> is one of the greatest horror <UNK> that features an incredible cast great stories and above par direction there are certainly worse ways to spend one hundred minutes of your life and while blood and guts fans will be highly disappointed fans of more tense horror efforts should enjoy this film immensely my rating for <UNK> house that <UNK> <UNK>  8 10
<START> without doubt the best of the novels of john le <UNK> <UNK> transformed into a classic film performances by peter <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the perfect spy <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> real name alexander <UNK> <UNK> czech intelligence <UNK> ray <UNK> <UNK> con man father and alan howard jack <UNK> <UNK> mentor believer and british <UNK> together with the rest of the characters are so perfect and natural the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award even the small parts such as major <UNK> are performed to perfection it says a lot for the power of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel that despite the <UNK> of <UNK> one cannot help but feel closer to <UNK> and <UNK> than to jack <UNK> and the slimy grant <UNK> of u s intelligence i have read the book at least a dozen times and watched the movie almost as many times and continue to be <UNK> by both if i had one book to take on a desert island a perfect spy would be the choice above all others
<START> and this is a great <UNK> movie in itself no matter how it evolved at point being a movie about disco it ended up as one of the ultimate movies in which kids want to rock out but the principal stands in their way think back to those <UNK> movies of the 50's in which the day is saved when alan freed comes to town with chuck <UNK> to prove that rock roll music is really cool and safe for the kids and <UNK> <UNK> gets a new <UNK> for the dance forward to the 1979 repeat the same plot but throw in da ramones whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century and then for the obligatory dj guest shot the real don steele throw in too all the elements of a roger corman produced comedy exploitation film except for the two day shooting schedule some of the familiar corman <UNK> players like clint howard mary <UNK> and dick miller there since bucket of blood and you've got one of the great <UNK> movies of the day one of the few films that uses deliberate cheesiness and gets away with it i showed the new dvd to a friend who could only remember seeing parts of it through a <UNK> induced <UNK> at the drive in and he agreed that this is one of the great movies to be watching drunk not the least for the lovely leading ladies and the great ramones footage
<START> hollywood's misguided obsession with sequels has resulted in more <UNK> than hits for every godfather ii there are dozens of more american <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and grease <UNK> while the original grease is not a great film the 1977 adaptation of the long running broadway hit does have songs <UNK> of the 1960's energetic choreography and an appealing cast when paramount began work on a follow up the producers came up nearly empty on every aspect that made the original a blockbuster br br fortunately for <UNK> michelle pfeiffer survived this experience and evidently learned to read scripts before <UNK> <UNK> her talent and beauty were already evident <UNK> and pfeiffer does seem to express embarrassment at the <UNK> dance routines and <UNK> songs that she is forced to perform <UNK> <UNK> however lacks even the skill to express embarrassment and his emotions run the gamut from <UNK> to <UNK> what romantic interest beyond <UNK> could the cool sassy pfeiffer have in the deadpan <UNK> that dull mystery will <UNK> long after the ludicrous <UNK> finale fades into a bad memory only cameos by veterans such as eve <UNK> connie stevens and sid <UNK> have any wit although <UNK> <UNK> does rise slightly above the lame material br br reviewers have complained that because grease 2 is always compared to the original the movie comes up lacking however even taken on its own terms the film is a <UNK> after a frenetic opening number which evidently exhausted the entire cast the energy <UNK> with few exceptions the original songs bear little resemblance to the early 1960's and the only nostalgia <UNK> is for our miss brooks and sid <UNK> comedy hour the jokes fall flat and the choreography in a film directed by choreographer patricia <UNK> is clumsy to be polite however worse films have been inflicted on audiences and inept sequels will be made as long as producers seek to milk a quick buck from <UNK> blockbusters unfortunately grease 2 is not even unintentionally funny instead the film holds the viewer's attention like a bad train wreck just when all the bodies seem to have been <UNK> the next scene <UNK> into even worse carnage
<START> what can i say this movie was so dumb stupid i thought it was a psychotic drag comedy they should <UNK> it <UNK> pregnant cat fight what a stupid waste of time if you want to see die die i want your baby drag queen jennifer <UNK> being her freaky self then just rent out one of the <UNK> movie oh ya the bride of <UNK> it's more fun watching the two ugly plastic dolls one of them jennifer <UNK> turned into the ugly female version of <UNK> having <UNK> plastic rubber sex then watching <UNK> hannah being pregnant dumb stupid jennifer <UNK> <UNK> up her <UNK> in a food <UNK> reminded me of my mother trying to do house work ok it's just bad
<START> the movie itself is not too bad many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script but it is watchable what really gives me the creeps though is that people like justin timberlake even get cast for movies and on top of that for movies like this one i have to admit i had never heard the man's name before watching this but the very instant he appeared i was just plain annoyed the voice is crap the face is a bad rip off of <UNK> the <UNK> is horrible and he cannot even properly <UNK> all three of them said to say i was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco because i was hoping from then on it would be morgan freeman and kevin spacey only too bad i was wrong these two and also ll cool j give a very decent performance and they are the main reason i give this a 4 br br i see many upcoming movies with the little timberlake cast and cannot believe it
<START> che part one was a fascinating experiment which did not only tell a very interesting story but it also tried to do something different with the biopic genre che part two is the excellent <UNK> of this experiment br br this movie offers all of the same attributes from the first one from the extraordinary performances specially from <UNK> del toro to steven <UNK> brilliant direction without forgetting its intention of breaking with the conventional rules from the <UNK> that is what i admire from <UNK> experiments they always try to do something different and unusual and they succeed most of the times br br the final message from this film is perfect and it includes everything we have been told about che <UNK> life the only fail i found on che part two is that a few parts felt a bit irrelevant br br in summary i give che part two a very enthusiastic recommendation because as the first one it is a brave and fascinating experiment which challenges the <UNK> and leaves us thinking
<START> i felt brain dead i'll tell you this is the worst film i have ever bought in my ignorance i thought this was the peter jackson film of the same name the performances are so terrible they are laughable the special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire the script <UNK> that kind of tv movie stare into the middle distance kind of acting the cast look as if they have been taking lessons from joey <UNK> they have one look each and stick to it plus i have never been confused by a movie until i sat down to watch this the is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes avoid like a plague
<START> i watched this movie when i was almost quite a kid and naturally was moved to tears by this story of a fox family the fantastic scenery at <UNK> the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare <UNK> with the protagonists i am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack to german viewers it might be useful to know that the <UNK> dubbing is the only one worth listening to i taped both <UNK> and br but i keep viewing the first one only
<START> <UNK> has some serious issues he has to come to grips with i get the feeling that he thinks he is pretty smart however this movie is almost <UNK> transparent and self righteous in addition there are a bunch of might makes right messages like when our local nazi <UNK> get beat up i mean who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of nazi <UNK> however he way <UNK> portrays the fight is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else there is another bad guy in reality a drunken frat boy who rapes one of the movie's protagonists in this instance i think that <UNK> actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved asks the frat boy to use a <UNK> and he either does not have one or does not want to use one in any event he does not <UNK> to her demands that he stop and he proceeds to have <UNK> despite her <UNK> i think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many <UNK> people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape well no means no this is a rape which probably occurs a lot in <UNK> across the country br br having established the rape how does <UNK> deal with it when the frat boy tries to call the woman her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a black bitch the <UNK> roommate appears to appeal to a <UNK> of ice cube et al who then proceed to physically <UNK> and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged apologies to roommate for his racist remarks however the apparently in <UNK> mind lesser crime of rape is not mentioned again no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy however <UNK> seems to be sending a <UNK> message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against <UNK> br br what is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but <UNK> while no doubt a talented director does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this <UNK>
<START> shame on julia roberts and john cusack they are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie the storyline was dumb and predictable the jokes were not funny the romance was not really romance i was all too happy when this movie ended
<START> this is an excellent film with an extraordinary cast and acting i was very disappointed with the academy awards when this didn't get the oscar for best film and for best actress <UNK> goldberg it certainly deserved it in any case take a look at it i am sure you will enjoy it very much
<START> witty quirky genuine surreal <UNK> wings one could ask what all of these words best describe and some those in <UNK> with the international film community may quickly say <UNK> but others may jump aboard the more american train and immediately yell the <UNK> effect strangely i would be one of those screaming for that sci fi <UNK> film mainly because none of those words that i initially mentioned at the start of this paragraph accurately depicts the <UNK> feature that i witnessed sure we all loved her in <UNK> and thought she was the daughter of jesus in the da <UNK> code but in this film first time director of a feature film at least <UNK> <UNK> doesn't give <UNK> the opportunity to shine sadly he gives nobody the opportunity to really demonstrate themselves because he is too <UNK> caught up in the moments of random chance to bring this film to anything but just a <UNK> never a true <UNK> <UNK> has ample and i use ample as a small word moments throughout this film where he could have built us a <UNK> story a genuinely whimsical fairy tale of love and coincidence but instead he fell face first into a mud bucket of chaotic <UNK> that overwhelmed us with inconsistent characters and a story that left us <UNK> for less br br <UNK> beautiful face <UNK> the cover of this box but do not be so taken immediately as i did in assuming that this was going to be another monumental journey into <UNK> french cinema <UNK> is in this film do not get me wrong but one could argue that she is not at the center of this story <UNK> job is to create a series of random events that eventually will lead to an audience friendly albeit confusing ending which <UNK> that meaning of refreshing melodrama he utterly utterly fails <UNK> fails by giving us the audience too many characters with too many characters he gives us too many random <UNK> and by the end you don't really care who is who or what is what or how is how your main focus happens to be centered solely on the ending credits and the time destination of their arrival <UNK> could have saved this film from the disaster it was if only <UNK> would have given her the center alas he did not but attempted to seemingly force a group of 12 through a <UNK> film hole about the size of a penny it just didn't work and we were left with a jam in which we were completely stuck br br <UNK> fails because he <UNK> so <UNK> on the minor details that for one of those rare film <UNK> he actually forgets the central focus i can say that there was no defined central focus to <UNK> in the beginning he attempts to create one with our two supposed main characters discovering that they share the same birthday and their <UNK> promises love by the <UNK> but we never go back to that throughout the film instead again we are <UNK> with new characters <UNK> scenes and meaningless drivel obviously chosen to direct us away from an actual story and more into a world full of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> i couldn't do it i couldn't believe this film writer <UNK> yes the same guy directing this garbage uses a technique so primitive in this film that i immediately felt like ending it immediately he must have been assuming that many of us were incapable of actually following the storyline or the scientific premise because he grabs the aid of a homeless person to actually fill in the respective <UNK> i didn't need this nor do i think <UNK> needed to <UNK> his audience in this matter while there were other elements that just didn't seem to work for me at all again felt like a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> paper this was the <UNK> on the cake i don't need my hand held through films br br i will give this film one star for credit this is a rather difficult genre to master successfully time travel films are especially hard because of the <UNK> amounts of possibilities that are never <UNK> for but with <UNK> it works because <UNK> semi explores the different <UNK> while i will counter with saying that he does not do it well it did make for at least five full minutes of enjoyment i liked where <UNK> was headed with this film he had a genuinely <UNK> story but the final execution just blew this film to <UNK> <UNK> could have saved this film if he would have <UNK> his characters while <UNK> up his premise and story i think my overall mood of this film would have changed if just these two simple directions were taken oh how i only wish i could time travel back to the production of this film to show <UNK> the errors of his ways br br overall for the first time and probably last this was a <UNK> film that i must say utterly disappointed me from the choppy opening to the <UNK> ending i just felt that <UNK> failed due to <UNK> <UNK> and horrid marketing marketing is something that i didn't mention before but why would anyone purchase this film thinking that it was an <UNK> 2 per the title released in hong kong and why would you place <UNK> <UNK> on the cover knowing full well that she wasn't carrying this film at all i believe that from the first minute that passed on my dvd player this film was in <UNK> while i will applaud his subject everything else was well below the level of mediocrity i cannot suggest this film to anyone br br grade out of
<START> i can't see the point in <UNK> a movie like this in <UNK> sarcasm when it is in no way intended to be anything more than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next line of <UNK> to beg <UNK> about br br this is a fun movie my children sat quietly through the entire thing and loved every minute of it granted the villain is a bit over the top with his silly costume and <UNK> <UNK> but this is a lot more easier to take than the dark gloomy and very morbid pokemon 3 br br my children have been watching pokemon since it started and they are soon getting to the ages where they will put off the childish things and move on to others i am glad that we got to enjoy this together
<START> what more can be said i have not been this fascinated with a young actress since <UNK> <UNK> burst upon the scene over ten years ago and although both <UNK> and blunt have played queens now seems to be the <UNK> for up and coming actresses the roles are complete polar <UNK> br br simply put if you are looking for high passion compelling drama and <UNK> intrigue this is not the movie for you this isn't to say that the script or direction was bad its just that the subject of the film did not lead too dramatic a life when compared to other notable <UNK> like elizabeth i anne <UNK> henry <UNK> henry v henry ii and <UNK> of <UNK> these are people whose lives were the stuff such as good soap operas are made of and whose <UNK> and decisions altered the course of british and in most cases world history victoria in contrast <UNK> the throne without incident she quasi <UNK> a nation that was fast becoming a global power due to <UNK> and the rise of the navy her state had a stable government led by competent and dynamic politicians and she married young had a <UNK> family life the facts of her life are not the <UNK> <UNK> drag such as powerful dramas are made of br br the heart of the film aside from the attempt to <UNK> her <UNK> upbringing and the <UNK> surrounding her throne is the story of the one thing that was truly shocking and surprising about her reign a love story marriage made for financial or political reasons is with reason not necessarily the place to look for world shaking passion yet victoria will always be remembered in history as being sort of a <UNK> saint marital <UNK> happiness and ideal family life thus central to the film is the budding love of victoria and her prince albert i was very taken with rupert friend's characterization of albert whom he portrayed as a kind patient somewhat earnest and maybe a touch naive young man looking to do good in the world and help in short he is a good man with a good heart not the most dynamic figure to base a drama around but as that is not the point of the story that does not matter the heart of the character shines through thanks to friend's understated yet earnest performance br br as for the queen well emily blunt is sublime her beauty cannot be denied but she is more than something pretty to look at her face is like <UNK> because of her <UNK> the slightest arch of the <UNK> glance of the eye or slight <UNK> smile delivers so much again this is not a <UNK> performance of heavy speeches and <UNK> <UNK> its not that kind of movie but what ms blunt does do with the role is show the simple humanity of the character with potent subtlety br br for example we see the <UNK> de <UNK> that has been kept in check by victoria's mother miranda richardson and her scheming <UNK> lover <UNK> expressed in the simple things like victoria trying to sketch her dog we see her delight and fascination upon first meeting albert by her eyes being continually drawn to him we see her nervous and overwhelmed when addressing <UNK> upon her <UNK> and my favorite scene of all in the film we see her nervous happy and hopeful as she <UNK> herself to do what really most women never have to do in their life ask the man she loves to marry her a <UNK> so ridiculous for those times and some would say now that victoria bursts out in nervous laughter before she can even say marry me again this is not a movie for over the top larger than life expressions but more a study in the subtleties of a character and making the little things say so much br br so overall i judge the film by what it is and what it tried to do and as such i give it a 7 i felt that some of the politics could be better explained and that some very fine actors were wasted with little do and little character development namely miranda richardson as the <UNK> of kent and the characters of <UNK> and lord <UNK> again the film need not have spent a large amount of time on those characters but a little more exposition would have helped to explain the political environment also i would have loved to have seen more of the <UNK> to married life between victoria and albert but that may be just my greed for more scenes between friend and blunt br br in summary don't view this film in terms of a historical drama but for what it really is a love story between two characters that happen to be historical figures i give this film a solid 7 for wonderful lead performances brilliant costumes and scenery and the magnificent victoria of emily blunt and anyone who has any shred of romance left in them you will be touched by the end of this movie god save the queen
<START> before <UNK> there was lucky the devil dog in 1978 on halloween night the movie devil dog the <UNK> of hell premiered a story of a family getting a new puppy from a farmer who just happen to be in the neighborhood selling <UNK> and <UNK> because their dog <UNK> was killed <UNK> everyone loves the new dog but there is something strange about him br br it isn't long until the father mike barry richard crenna first blood starts to notice his wife betty <UNK> <UNK> where the boys are jackson county jail <UNK> is different and his kids charlie and bonnie <UNK> <UNK> witch mountain and fantastic <UNK> and kim richards witch mountain <UNK> and the professor hello larry <UNK> <UNK> also have changed does the dog have something to do with it he's determined to find out and do whatever it takes to save his family br br this movie is great because it has <UNK> and kim playing a darker side of themselves than what we saw on those witch mountain movies this is one of the many 70's made for tv horror movies that was actually scary for a made for tv horror movie the music was creepy and even the ending which i won't tell made you think br br this movie also stars ken <UNK> cliff barnes of dallas and r g armstrong who couldn't stay away from devil movies remember race with the devil br br it's worth watching
<START> i've seen the blob several times and is one of the better low budget alien invasion movies from the 1950's br br a strange meteor lands just outside a small town and an elderly man goes to investigate this a strange <UNK> like substance then <UNK> itself to one of his arms and a young couple who saw the meteor land arrive in time and take him to the local doctor's where the old man then gets completely absorbed by the mass the doctor and his nurse are the next victims and the mass is getting bigger when these incidents are reported to the police they don't believe the young couple and <UNK> them of making all this up they finally believe them when the mass now huge turns up in the town's cinema and everybody runs into the streets screaming it then <UNK> itself on a diner with the young couple and some others inside the blob is stopped by <UNK> a load of fire <UNK> at it and it <UNK> which is its weakness it is then transported by plane to the frozen wastes of the <UNK> and <UNK> of there but it is only frozen not dead br br this movie has a typical setting for its period teenagers and a small town the blob has a good rock and roll style theme song at the beginning and the movie is atmospheric throughout br br the sequel beware the blob followed in 1972 and a remake came in 1988 but this is the best of the blob movies br br the cast is lead by steve mcqueen the great escape and is the movie that made him a star and <UNK> <UNK> plays his girlfriend i'm not familiar with any of the other stars br br the blob is a must see for all sci fi fans fantastic br br rating 4 stars out of 5

<START> we rented the dvd hoping for a good western the film was pretty and the scenes reasonable but the ideas were very bad here are my problems with the film br br in the first part why exactly did the bad guy kill the mine owner not really connected to the movie except to establish how bad he was and to have a <UNK> br br the bank employee gone bad just acts too poorly to convincingly decide to hire killers to off his <UNK> at least keep us guessing no character developed at all for the bank owners or the bank employee br br very long <UNK> in much of anything happening br br absurd premise that martin still needed to see the judge after the gang <UNK> to killing the in laws even more absurd that he <UNK> to judge and judge will not listen to the sheriff guy even more ridiculous that martin his hung and rope breaks then the sheriff takes him at <UNK> to finally head back to his town and save his wife from the bad bank employee wouldn't he just return after the quick <UNK> of the gang to save wife and arrest bad bank guy just send the judge a note that gang <UNK> before being killed on trail overall very sad acting and no point to movie
<START> quirky independent theatrical christian slater these are all <UNK> that made me look forward to spending an hour or so discovering a jewel of a film boy was i disappointed julian <UNK> never gets over itself the film is relentlessly self conscious i found myself unable to suspend disbelief for even a moment the overdone obviously theatrical sets the overdone obviously theatrical acting the overdone obviously theatrical directing well you get the idea br br <UNK> do not need to be delivered <UNK> hammer style and it's hard to feel much of anything for julian <UNK> because we never know much about him the ridiculous girlfriend the annoying <UNK> the idiotic <UNK> the <UNK> kids why would anyone particularly anyone with a life long ambition to get to the <UNK> <UNK> character decide to stay in such a dismal place
<START> another excellent arnold movie this futuristic movie has great action in it and is one of <UNK> best movies arnold is framed as a bad guy in this movie and plays a game of death this movie is excellent and a great sci fi action movie i've always liked this movie and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time 10 out of 10 perfection
<START> this movie consists of such great emotion especially with its outstanding soundtrack that <UNK> with the film tom cruise is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make films and to entertain this movie was not the best the first time i watched it but after about 3 more times i decided that this is one of the best films that i have ever seen it takes place in new york and progresses on through his lifestyle he discovers a <UNK> in his life with his girlfriend diaz he goes through a state of depression and then an <UNK> blend of imagination this film was beyond my expectations and is one of <UNK> best films ever
<START> iq is a cute romantic comedy featuring two great actors that seem to click well on screen plot is a typical guy wrong for girl guy gets girl format but makes the solid point that one must love with the heart and not the the mind addition of albert einstein and his band of geniuses provides excellent comic relief overall a good movie not great but good
<START> david h <UNK> 's script seemed initially having some real smart points that could've made good romantic comedy but but but oh dear what did ever happen in the way br br i'll tell you what happened originally it's animal house 1978 and <UNK> 1982 although that was long time ago but those are the <UNK> the <UNK> of the new genre the crude teen comedy then the 1990s came after important instances that became smash hits repulsive ones am i add such as problem child 1990 dumb and dumber 1994 the nutty professor 1996 and there's something about mary 1998 which i think <UNK> is affected by there was the top of the era and the prophet of the next era the one and only american pie 1999 <UNK> undoubtedly and <UNK> a <UNK> icon after that i think every comedy of that kind got to be that highly filthy <UNK> <UNK> nasty to be admired by the youth otherwise it might be out of fashion br br i believe that <UNK> had a smart plot first as a script then its makers got to add some real big amount of <UNK> <UNK> strangely shameless sex to be made at those days as easy as pie like they had to fill every scene with <UNK> elements such as masturbation <UNK> sex <UNK> etc just to look a <UNK> mode they're wholly unnecessary elements to the story but surely they are so necessary to make the <UNK> and to catch the latest <UNK> in making teen comedies the problem is in how all of that has replaced already any possible comedy in it br br some of its moments looked literally horrible and that as you see is the point it's all in jason <UNK> 's looks and performance <UNK> disgusting to the <UNK> so the ambition transformed from being that romantic comedy into making what wasn't done before of pure <UNK> images to be more like a horror where you're asking all the time what <UNK> would happen <UNK> <UNK> etc these are the <UNK> combination to create a comedy nowadays br br though even if you hated it you've got to love something mostly for being bold for me it was only gina <UNK> <UNK> scene anyhow they designed it as a whole to achieve being <UNK> for <UNK> like an <UNK> naughty dream though the majority of it was near to <UNK> nightmare br br what made me sad is that this one at its core was a real potential work and not another cheap another stupid comedy as it eventually managed to be remember well the details of stealing the <UNK> the first 2 minutes so the movie's main plot weirdo trying to reach a girl by <UNK> cool guys through the pattern of boy loves girl and girl loves another boy because save that it's nothing but a <UNK> schlock it dealt with its material the tacky way bunch of dirty college boys who got nothing to do but making <UNK> <UNK> out of anything would do it ended up as being and i'm sorry to say it a smiling sh t br br at its end it said something can you imagine about how it's the time and the place too for the <UNK> or the slack to win totally like this comedy itself it sounds good ending yet for totally another better movie which could assure my opinion about this one as smart one once and it doesn't need much to understand that this movie's makers were the real <UNK> maybe being stupid is a way to be smart in hollywood but even if the final result here wasn't at least witty by any sense of the word br br p s its scriptwriter david h <UNK> who wrote the story of american pie 2 as well has a main page at the imdb where you'll find under the additional details his usual plot <UNK> which are sex <UNK> crude humor they just forgot to write <UNK> while <UNK> or <UNK> 70 year old women
<START> this is a powerful documentary about domestic abuse in the <UNK> the sisters in law are female lawyers and judges who in 2004 successfully <UNK> husbands for abusive treatment of their <UNK> and won one woman a divorce she desperately wanted through a muslim <UNK> it is rather long about two hours but fascinating in terms both of the individual <UNK> and <UNK> and the lawyers who successfully represented them in court rooms <UNK> over by female judges it will leave you as it left me with many questions about exactly how this change occurred how and when did women come to <UNK> positions of authority in the <UNK> have the several cases featured in this film had a significant effect on the treatment of women generally by their <UNK> was the <UNK> of a divorce by a muslim court against the express wishes of the husband a one time event i'm not suggesting that the film makers could have answered these questions they made the movie two years ago not yesterday and the movie they made deserves a wide audience
<START> leslie <UNK> series of novels of the adventures of the slightly shady simon <UNK> the saint was brought to the screen in the late 1930s with the up and coming george sanders as <UNK> it was a careful choice sanders usually would play villains with occasional nice roles <UNK> in foreign <UNK> the title hero in the strange case of uncle harry the framed best friend of robert <UNK> in rage in heaven here his <UNK> to bend the rules and break a law briefly fit his heavy persona while his good looks and suave behavior made <UNK> a fit shady hero like <UNK> <UNK> boston <UNK> and to an extent peter <UNK> mr <UNK> br br the films are not the best series of movie mystery serials but they are <UNK> like <UNK> holmes series or <UNK> chan's series the show frequently had actors repeating roles or playing new ones the anti heroine in the film here was played by wendy <UNK> who would show up in a second film in the series this and slightly familiar movie sets make the series a comfortable experience for the viewers who hear the buzz of the dialog always showing <UNK> <UNK> in keeping one step ahead of the bad guys without noting the obvious <UNK> of the plot all these mysteries have <UNK> due to the fact that even the best writers of the genre can't avoid repeating old ideas again and again and again br br here the moment when that happened was when one of the cast admitted his affection for <UNK> which she was long aware of shortly after he tries to protect her from the police but as the film dealt with the identity of a criminal mastermind it became obvious that this person was made so slightly noble as to merit being the mysterious mastermind i e the script disguised him as the least likely suspect br br <UNK> is after the proof that her father who died in prison was framed by the real criminals in a robbery gang she has several people <UNK> her <UNK> like william <UNK> and she gets advice from the mastermind on planning embarrassing <UNK> that can't be <UNK> on her the d a who got her father convicted <UNK> <UNK> is determined to get <UNK> and her gang the only detective who seems to have a chance to solve the case is jonathan hale who is <UNK> sanders but reluctantly working with him br br the cast has some nice moments in the script hale currently on a special <UNK> is tempted to eat a rich <UNK> dinner made for sanders by willie best he gets a serious upset stomach as a result <UNK> sanders and <UNK> to flee <UNK> apartment best has to remind him when he feels better to head for a location that sanders told him to go to at a certain time br br there is also an interesting role for gilbert <UNK> usually playing decent people like the brow beaten husband in between two worlds he plays a socially prominent <UNK> here whose demise is reminiscent of that of a character in a bogart movie br br on the whole a well made film for the second half of a movie house billing in 1939 it will entertain you even if it does not remain in your memory

<START> this pile of sh t is tied in my book as the worst thing ever made i can't believe that someone actually <UNK> this crap let alone <UNK> made it horrible horrible horrible not even worth mentioning the damn story or any details about it that's how bad it actually is avoid it like <UNK>
<START> seldom do i ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that i must speak about it immediately this movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic i happened to see the dubbed version but i'm on my way right now to grab the dvd <UNK> with original chinese dialogue still the dubbing didn't get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour poison clan rocks the world br br the story telling stays true to chinese methods of intrigue suspense and inter personal relationships you can expect twists and turns as the identities of the 5 <UNK> are revealed and an expert pace br br the martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed it's like watching real animals fight each other but <UNK> from their own <UNK> martial arts forms such level of skill amongst the cast is <UNK> in modern day cinema br br the combination provides for a serious dose of old chinese culture and i recommend it solely on the basis of the film's genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the <UNK> of its execution of course if you just want to see people <UNK> each other along with crude forms of ancient chinese torture be my guest
<START> i love claire danes and kate beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role the movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some monastery working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial arts like discipline the acting and filmography and amazing colors of what is supposed to be thailand is eye catching but claire <UNK> steals the entire movie and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end in an act of amazing <UNK> <UNK> of and completely unexpected in the real world the flaws are minute and i recommend the film which seems buried sadly forever to rare tv <UNK> i for one want the film for my collection a collection of only 10 rated films watch it you will be very touched
<START> i couldn't wait to put this movie in my dvd player when i rented it then after i started it i couldn't wait to get it out of my dvd player actually i watched all of the movie my wife and i kept waiting and waiting for something funny to happen but nothing funny ever does the box read like the it would be really funny the premise of the movie sound good ben stiller is funny jack black is funny how could this movie miss well it does miss this is the <UNK> comedy i have ever watched nobody i have talked with thought it was even slightly funny it is just a really lame movie trust me <UNK> it <UNK> it
<START> i have seen many many productions of the <UNK> now perhaps i viewed this movie from the <UNK> point of view of a theatrical director but i was disappointed i'm sure people in the specific business of ballet choreography find this production impressive but from a purely theatrical perspective i found everything from design to choreography to be lackluster and <UNK> of a motion picture none of the <UNK> weird and impressive costumes looked like what they were supposed to be i e the <UNK> didn't look like <UNK> the rats didn't look like rats but rather like chocolate kisses the acting was weak perhaps toned down too much for the screen and the choreography just didn't do anything for me this makes the entire show very satisfactory at best as if it were intended to not set itself apart from any other production but remember again this is from the artistic perspective of a theatrical director not a dancer or a choreographer but a straight male theatrical director
<START> <UNK> was one of my favorite heroes as a kid i used to borrow the books from the school library every chance i got my favorite one was the red sea sharks so much action and humor br br this documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of <UNK> and his development of <UNK> the film <UNK> personal experience in <UNK> <UNK> and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the chan character was very moving br br a great documentary of a very talented and well loved artist a great example of someone who has become <UNK> <UNK> and has brought joy of millions of children and the young at heart all over the world
<START> this movie was by far the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life i'm not even kidding it was poorly made and the actors couldn't act it was a waste of my time and money it looked like a movie that my friends and i could have put together on our own the case the movie came in is definitely a disguise nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case it appears that the director or make up artist has just put black eye liner under <UNK> eyes an called them a zombie the credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie which watching the credits was the best part of the movie this was honestly an awful movie and i couldn't believe how badly it was put together scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like whats going on the audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of <UNK> joking around making a fake fight scene br br if you are considering renting or buying this movie i would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show's how awful it truly is i wish i would have watched it before i rented it
<START> i don't hand out ten star ratings easily a movie really has to impress me and the bourne ultimatum has gone far beyond that furthermore this trilogy has come together so nicely that i believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture <UNK> of our time though all three films could not be any more different from the <UNK> novels they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement the bourne ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete yet i could not even attempt to stop smiling for hours br br from the moment that the opening title appeared i knew we were in for a ride paul <UNK> has done it again everything we love from the previous bourne films is here once again the action the dialogue and of course the shaky camera however for me that last one was never a problem i think it adds to the suspense br br i will be back to see this film several times before it is released on dvd simply because it is genius it is a perfectly satisfying conclusion and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie and altogether an unforgettable trilogy
<START> ultimately too silly and pointless yes there is the <UNK> cage metaphor but probably most kids would miss that forgettable instantly br br animation is as we have come to expect super real the plot line could best be described as thin but <UNK> although the ending seemed <UNK> to me br br the <UNK> underworld is a suitably disgusting reflection of the world above and somehow wealth and money seem to count for a lot there too oh yes and there's a romantic interest with the female being the smarter more <UNK> and go getting of the pair this in itself is rapidly becoming a tiresome anti stereotype probably your kids will love it though
<START> this movie is entertaining enough due to an excellent performance by virginia madsen and the fact that lindsey <UNK> is lovely however the reason the movie is so predictable is that we've seen it all before i've haven't read the book a mother's gift but i hope for britney and <UNK> spears sake it is completely different than this movie unless you consider ending a movie with what is essentially a music video an original idea the entire movie brings to mind the word <UNK>
<START> i saw this movie being a jane austen addicted and always feeling <UNK> about cinematographic rendering of the complexity of her novels well this <UNK> is simply accurate intelligent delicate careful <UNK> <UNK> intense in a word perfect br br emma is one of <UNK> most delightful and funny novels thanks to overall irony <UNK> situations and characters the movie respected this subtle irony not <UNK> the comic element miss bates above all what engaged me in the novel and the movie <UNK> it clearly is the deep knowledge of human life shown by the english novelist and the modern look with which women men and their relation are handled and it is astounding if we think how a woman novelist of the 18th century who lived almost a secluded life could grasp such depth and truth about life as she did that most and still <UNK> me we can feel this <UNK> throughout the movie just replace costumes and use a more current language but the situations the feelings the ideas would be extremely modern i think of the morbid interest in other people's lives or that <UNK> envy which now as ever rule women's relations and still the difficulty in revealing and giving expression to one's feelings especially love every situation gets a universal and out of time value br br the cast is really talented and offer very good and extremely brilliant performances a young gwyneth paltrow is particularly suitable for this role nowadays she would be probably too mature for it toni <UNK> is simply great and how i <UNK> them for the wonderful dresses they could wear and then the breathtaking english countryside where every situation gets such a magic and dream like dimension a really enjoyable and deserving movie
<START> for what it is raising victor vargas is about as close to perfection as a film can get either sheer genius from a <UNK> auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything <UNK> probably some of each this simple little slice of urban life ethnic first love flick <UNK> out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds the film begins with a strong flavor of street but works its way into a latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the <UNK> of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another in my experience never has so much been done with so little cast of <UNK> <UNK> director etc praised by the critics but not for everyone raising victor vargas is recommended for indie lovers and <UNK> into simple tales rich in <UNK> a
<START> the film <UNK> was a first and a last for greta garbo it was her first american made film at mgm the only studio in the usa that she would ever work at it was also the last time that someone else was billed above her in the credits that being her leading man her <UNK> cortez br br <UNK> is based on the popular spanish writer's <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> work <UNK> <UNK> it concerns a pair of <UNK> lovers garbo and cortez who can't quite get together mostly due to the <UNK> of <UNK> mother <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> is a wicked woman who has some set ideas about who her son should be marrying remember this is spain and such arranged <UNK> were still even in those times quite proper <UNK> has <UNK> <UNK> in mind as a daughter in law she's the <UNK> of mack <UNK> a man grown rich in <UNK> raising <UNK> provides a few moments of comic relief with his tender concern for the <UNK> before they grow into big old <UNK> to be butchered br br <UNK> <UNK> had previous novels the four <UNK> of the apocalypse and blood and sand previously filmed with <UNK> <UNK> in the lead it might have been interesting if <UNK> had done this one with garbo but he might have been beyond film making when this was done in any event one of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> cortez fills in with the male lead br br one reason <UNK> might not have wanted this film is because clearly the lead character is <UNK> unlike the other two works previously mentioned when she gets done dirt by cortez who is doing what <UNK> and her <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> marshall tell her she leaves spain and goes to france where she becomes a great opera star and leads quite the <UNK> life there br br when she returns to spain and tries to <UNK> things <UNK> is even more <UNK> she has a political career in mind for her son cortez is now running for the spanish <UNK> which curiously enough is called the <UNK> br br the title refers to a <UNK> and a <UNK> breaking causing all kinds of havoc in the countryside cortez in fact <UNK> the <UNK> in a row boat trying to rescue garbo from <UNK> way when they do get together they have a brutally frank discussion the brutality coming from garbo br br the special effects here primitive though they seem now are quite remarkable for their time they look very similar to the shots used in 20th century <UNK> the <UNK> came that came out in 1939 and that won an oscar for special effects unfortunately for <UNK> it came out one year before oscar made his debut br br i'm not going to give any endings away so you'll have to see the film to find out if cortez and garbo get together in the end garbo rightly won rave reviews for her performance and in an age when exaggerated gestures was the norm in silent screen acting she was remarkably subtle in her role so she would be the rest of her career she had a remarkable face for closeups br br although greta garbo would go on to do far better work than <UNK> this film is still a fitting debut for her on the american big screen and holds up very well for today's audience
<START> i only saw it once this happened in <UNK> i was seven the movie 13 br br we were so young but i kept in mind forever the strong moments of <UNK> sacrifice br br i realized that time how much a people can be hardly <UNK> and used by a foreign nation under these historical circumstances in the movie the personal relation of friendship a kind of friendship that ignores itself the one raised between people who share daily life who see each other faces who knows each other names but belong to different worlds can only make appears then in the most critical moments a <UNK> question emerges whom are we in first supposed to be loyal which people family <UNK> the person you know close to you you do not have time to give a perfect answer urgency is there and it is for life or death gunga din gives his answer with sacrifice of himself somewhere in a confuse manner a problem remains <UNK> the emotion grows with the rhythm of the movie until somebody dies just one life nothing compared to so many other <UNK> or realities we can see today because this death this unique <UNK> life i lived it i shared with my child <UNK> friendship it was lived by the <UNK> i was that day i loose gunga din for ever as i left behind later my pretty childhood as i left from then so many worlds i lived in i left all that for good and these lines are today a short visit i didn't expect to do this morning when getting up
<START> few films have left me with such a feeling of <UNK> and this is not a compliment since i saw it in a theater how it ended there i can only wonder i was subjected to 90 <UNK> of hateful derivative garbage the main impression being a bit like this other sick o movie don't answer the phone but worse the <UNK> of it all rape and all is shown without any distance unlike strong stuff like last house on the left and utter contempt for the perfect victims and everybody involved leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic <UNK> at the end i felt like taking a shower no credits to the director
<START> surely no saturday morning tv kids' show was ever done this poorly after all those producers had to count on the audience coming back well in this awful offering they could at least count the money they saved on sets the script could have been a reject from some long forgotten space opera serial with a few smarmy lines added for cool dude <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> to <UNK> hayden no director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline so the action just <UNK> <UNK> along the spaceship props are absurd a <UNK> wall clock and <UNK> <UNK> for example but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history most are crude drawings and it's all <UNK> in an often <UNK> red light even <UNK> bare hairy chest is used as a prop and it's a bad one as <UNK> thin as the plot any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the martians and will probably agree completely
<START> <UNK> wig does not look good she is not cute and pretty enough to play annie annie sticks out in the movie as her outfits look like halloween costumes terrible acting and terrible plots this movie is such a change from the 1982 version i think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role ashley johnson portrays a very <UNK> annie not appealing at all at least the casting director got it right with daddy <UNK> ms <UNK> was also miscast <UNK> belle played molly alright warning this movie might insult your iq so you might just want to only show it to very young children 8 and younger some of the plots are too fictional and could hardly take place in the real world
<START> with the exception of the sound none of the above are really criticisms for this type of no budget truly independent horror film make up effects and gore are very good and the lead actor was effective the lead actress although attractive needs some <UNK> as she was particularly poor br br the major problem with <UNK> is it's length at <UNK> minutes its half an hour too long to be effective as a slasher movie plot wise only about ten minute of the first fifty are relevant br br in places it is visually engaging and sometimes the lack of lighting works in the films favour however when this is combined with the poor sound as is the case with most of the film large sections are difficult to watch br br this could certainly be an entertaining if unoriginal serial killer back from the dead movie with some <UNK> and ruthless editing in its current form it plays like an unfinished rough cut
<START> this is the best made for tv movie of all time am i saying this because i'm a huge <UNK> fan partially but even without her i'd still see it i'm a fan of serial killer genre films and believe this to be a great entry in that category also mary <UNK> easily ranks among <UNK> top five character creations totally memorable like she really exists i'd have her on my side too if there was a mystery to be solved she plays the character like she does with her real life with complete confidence in everything she does seems sweet honest nice just like she is in real life so is that acting yes indeed she's sort of a rebel once again this time she's not bad she's too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law but she doesn't do things the normal teenager would do instead she spends her time reading detective <UNK> and <UNK> crimes a cliche <UNK> she's sort of <UNK> her father's death in a different way than vigilante style at the time alicia seemed to be playing the same characters rebellious seductive without a parent a loner this happens here too but she's a bit nerdy this time around that doesn't matter she's still cool as a nerd check this out soon or else <UNK> will be investigating why you haven't
<START> what do you get when you have bad acting bad directing scenes that are excruciatingly long terrible lighting painful editing and awful effects you get jessica a ghost story seems its shot on <UNK> which is fine but the lighting has to compliment this medium in this case it does not there are a few <UNK> where the person's face is entirely in shadow one scene in particular is the scene at the <UNK> it's a joke if you ask me some of the scenes were so long that they could have easily been cut in half but i guess then they wouldn't have a film at feature length the main character is incredibly flat he's the lead male so he should have some hero elements to his character but he does not he <UNK> and is scared the entire film i could go on but i don't want to waste my time although the lighting was terrible i must say that they did have nice camera movement too bad the lighting didn't compliment it the cover of the dvd is nice and that's where it ends just terrible
<START> a long film about a very important character from south africa stephen biko he is one of these blacks who did not survive apartheid who actually died a long time before their normal time the already old film though does not show how important biko was what he really represented his life and his teaching is reduced to little at best a few witty remarks the film being from 1987 the objective was to push south africa over the brink that would lead her to <UNK> so the film aims at showing how irrational the south african supporters of apartheid are in 1987 to show this the film has to look beyond <UNK> death hence to center its <UNK> not on biko but on a white liberal journalist and his escaping the absurd system in which he is living his escape is made necessary because of the <UNK> he is the victim of along with his family and because he wants to <UNK> the first book on biko after his death and that can only happen in england the film shows a way to escape south africa while apartheid is still standing and killing so do not expect this way to be realistic and true it could not be but the film has tremendously aged because it does not show south africa with any historical <UNK> the very <UNK> that has taken place under nelson <UNK> <UNK> and that is called forgiveness provided those who want to be forgiven speak up and out the film is strong and emotional but that very historical limit makes it rather weak today especially since the film does not mention the third racial community the indians <UNK> books or films all have that <UNK> they are looking at the person they are supposed to portrait from only one point of view that explains why the film has aged so much seems to be coming from so long ago as if nothing had changed at all a remake is necessary br br dr jacques <UNK> university paris 1 <UNK> <UNK> university <UNK> saint quentin en <UNK> <UNK>
<START> anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it poorly i would refer them to roger <UNK> review of this movie he is one of the most respected critics in the industry and he gave it 3 1 2 stars br br this is a great movie it may not be perfect or spectacular but i enjoyed it a chorus line is not so much a story as it is a group of stories about the lives of broadway <UNK> i read reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between <UNK> and cassie that is an incorrect view it is another story along with all the other stories that are told about each of the broadway <UNK> what people fail to realize is that those who are dancers for broadway shows go through the same things that the common man goes through and that i think is really the point of the whole show it is to showcase not only the talent of these special dancers but to give us some poignant things to think about in regard to life in general this is a study of life as a broadway star anyone who has <UNK> of becoming a broadway star watches this movie with a great feeling of relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through br br this is a great musical it has its slow points and at times gets a little confused with the pacing of certain story lines but all in all i thoroughly enjoyed it take a closer look at the movie and then maybe you will understand what i am talking about
<START> i've noticed over the years that when a rock star makes his final album before his death that album if it's not his best is usually prolific in some way and worthy of a listen at least the album is usually good enough to <UNK> a legacy however when it comes to comedians especially mainstream comics who star in their own vehicles their final movie is usually god awful john belushi had neighbors john candy had <UNK> east chris <UNK> had almost heroes phil <UNK> had small soldiers and rodney <UNK> had this movie br br back by midnight although it may not have been <UNK> very last film is weak in every sense of the word it wrapped filming in 2002 according to this website and it's safe to say that it would have stayed on the shelves if <UNK> was still alive i have been a big fan of <UNK> since i was in my early teens and it pains me to see how rotten this film was br br what <UNK> me the most is that a number of other talented people took part in a movie with a very weak premise to begin with <UNK> a great comedian who usually played his comic persona on film is a prison warden who houses a close <UNK> group of inmates when the owner of the prison colonel tom parker meets sam <UNK> <UNK> eli <UNK> randy quaid cuts funding for the prison the warden sends a group of inmates to break out of prison rob <UNK> eponymous <UNK> stores of <UNK> goods and break back into prison with the <UNK> by taking what's in the <UNK> stores they are i guess taking what they believe <UNK> owes them br br with this flimsy premise the movie <UNK> and <UNK> frequently on top of that the jokes that you think would be this movie's salvation are not even close to funny not even from mr no respect himself that is incredibly disappointing too because you'd expect a movie with oscar nominated randy quaid <UNK> alley gilbert <UNK> ed <UNK> jr <UNK> smith and others to be at least a little bit funny instead quaid plays a character we've seen before in countless other comedies alley plays a british <UNK> with an awful british accent could this movie not afford an actual british person and every joke was poorly set up and poorly timed by virtually every member of this ensemble it was just not a good comedy in any sense of the word br br back by midnight was rated r mainly for language and one scene of nudity the irony in this fact is that many of the jokes are so audience insulting that even kids if you edit out the language would walk out of this film the physical gags are also incredibly predictable especially when <UNK> pet monkey <UNK> <UNK> character when the monkey grabs a pair of <UNK> and jumps on <UNK> couch who wouldn't know where that gag was going br br being a direct to video comedy of course i didn't expect any oscar winning material on here the truth is though <UNK> has made some great timeless comedies before easy money and back to school are hilarious still and were definitely not oscar worthy in the slightest however there's a difference between making a dumb comedy that's funny and making a dumb comedy with the latter kind of comedy it seems like the filmmakers don't even try which is precisely the case with this lame excuse for a wasted 90 minutes rest in peace rodney but add this film to your <UNK> of forgettable comedies like meet <UNK> sparks 1997 and the <UNK> 1999 this film dare i say it is not even worth seeing
<START> snow white which just came out in <UNK> where i had the chance to see it of course refers to the world famous fairy tale and it also refers to coke in the end real snow of the swiss <UNK> plays its part as well br br thus all three aspects of the title are addressed in this film there is a lot of <UNK> on scene and there is also a pale dark haired girl with a prince who has to go through all kind of trouble to come to her rescue br br but it's not a fairy tale it's supposed to be a realistic drama located in <UNK> switzerland according to the <UNK> br br technically the movie is close to perfect unfortunately a weak plot <UNK> dialogs a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed acting don't add up to create authenticity thus as a <UNK> i remained <UNK> br br and then there were the clichés which drove me crazy one by one snow white is a rich and spoiled upper class daughter of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them because they were so busy all the time her best girlfriend on the other hand has loving and caring parents they a <UNK> and a housewife live in a tiny flat poor and happy and ignorant of the desperate situation their daughter is in the good guy prince is a musician from the french speaking part of switzerland which is considered to be the <UNK> less successful but emotionally <UNK> <UNK> of the country he has problems with his parents they are <UNK> from spain who don't seem to accept his wild way of living until the father becomes seriously ill and <UNK> his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed br br and so it goes on naturally the drug dealer is brutal the <UNK> are heartless the club owner is a playboy and the photographer although a woman has only her career in mind when she exposes snow white in artsy pornographic pictures at a show br br this review doesn't need a spoiler in order to let you add these pieces to an obvious plot as i like other films by <UNK> e g forget <UNK> i was quite disappointed let's hope for the next one
<START> not since <UNK> <UNK> have i seen a greater cartoon on tv the colors are great the voices <UNK> be better the characters are so original great great cartoon hope <UNK> continues to develop this cartoon hope the season dvd comes out soon i love cartoons like this and i hope more people tune in to se this great cartoon it is very hard to find the season dvd so if somebody finds a store that is selling it please let me know the only <UNK> <UNK> available on nick shop is a great <UNK> shirt but very very very expensive if you love <UNK> and who <UNK> you'll love <UNK> too
<START> the thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy shaky camera work and the fast confusing cutting i am not against those kind of <UNK> devices if they are done right like oliver stone and steven soderbergh proof with most of their movies but in this case there was way too much it seems like the jump cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end for a movie that pretends to be violent ruthless and morally corrupt it is <UNK> that it's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development that is another disappointing aspect of the movie if i want to watch an over the top action flick i do not need any justification but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of denzel <UNK> character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances the first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb <UNK> and clichés are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens so the movie does not work either on the level of a believable drama thriller nor as a pure action movie of course the movie is not as bad as some <UNK> the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years but i absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool for a video clip it is way too long and for a movie it has too little substance
<START> the bourne ultimatum begins <UNK> mid chase and in pulse <UNK> fashion explodes from there as jason bourne matt damon absolutely superb tracks down the <UNK> behind the cia black <UNK> that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity a <UNK> icy david <UNK> as the man behind the curtain is added to the returning cast of <UNK> including joan allen excellent and julia stiles non existent br br like the second entry in the series i wished paul <UNK> shaky hand held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of <UNK> however that being said it's a perfect way to capture the tense claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand to hand combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across <UNK> with the occasional big car pile up part of the fun of the bourne series is the constant globe <UNK> and manipulation of technology and <UNK> that seem to defy the laws of physics and current <UNK> the bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper reality that is full of technological based magic it makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time but i'll be damned if it isn't a blast to watch them get there br br with the absence of the <UNK> and involving <UNK> <UNK> the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between damon and stiles but she is so blank faced an actress it never really leads to anything still this can be forgiven for unlike the identity and the supremacy this ultimatum reveals all and we finally learn the truth about <UNK> past it's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series and if they have any good sense and damon gets his wish this will be the perfect end to it
<START> i just got back from the film and i'm completely appalled this movie is an absolute mockery to all of mankind the theatre i was in maybe had 4 other people this movie was recommended to me and i couldn't believe that this person liked it i can't believe that any sane human would like it there was no plot no plot at all it was a joke how can you make a movie about nothing this movie only goes to show why hollywood is in such a <UNK> i can only just look at the spiral of the horror movie industry and giggle what a travesty to all <UNK> this is true of all the new teen horror flicks grudge boogeyman ring saw series it is all such trash don't support this kind of <UNK>
<START> if this book remained faithful to the book then we can only assume that the author was ignorant of history mark anthony never died of <UNK> <UNK> in battle as depicted he died a <UNK> death by committing suicide and even then he asked his slave to do it for him the slave chose to kill himself instead in the real story mark anthony was ashamed by the <UNK> great <UNK> and decided to copy him but even in death mark anthony was a drunken failure and failed at his own suicide attempt he cried out for <UNK> and was taken to her bleeding she <UNK> his <UNK> up on <UNK> and mark anthony died a while later if you want history don't watch this movie if you want romantic drivel then you will probably enjoy it
<START> i saw the movie with two grown children although it was not as clever as shrek i thought it was rather good in a movie theatre surrounded by children who were on spring break there was not a sound so i know the children all liked it there parents also seemed engaged the death and apparent death of characters brought about the appropriate <UNK> and comments hopefully people realize this movie was made for kids as such it was successful although i liked it too personally i liked the <UNK>
<START> i can't say how closely the film follows the novel never having read the book but since this <UNK> in at some six and a half hours it's a good bet that most of the base are covered or at least we can say with some <UNK> that this isn't a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> version br br the production values are high well up to the standards of other bbc classic series like inspector morse and sherlock holmes we can believe <UNK> london looked sounded and thought a lot like this there are some occasional minor <UNK> some <UNK> firing a pistol with a <UNK> cap in <UNK> or <UNK> or whenever this took place br br the acting too is to be <UNK> suzanne burden is the polite and honest heroine who quietly goes about doing good she's cute too in a mature way her beauty in her compassionate nature not in any <UNK> <UNK> elliott is her guardian and more than that as it turns out burden and elliott are two of the very few characters who are good in an <UNK> way another is a former sergeant forced to do evil by evil people another is a poor and helpless young boy br br i don't think anyone else could have written this it's got all the <UNK> of dickens poverty tragic deaths capitalism in the raw the generous rich guy in his <UNK> home hidden <UNK> shadowy motives and the <UNK> or outright <UNK> of the justice system well not the justice system as a whole but the <UNK> which was evidently a court that decided matters having to do with the distribution of property so i gather from <UNK> it became so <UNK> rigid and <UNK> that it was thoroughly <UNK> in england in 1973 twice <UNK> character describes it as a curse the most impressive scene involves a money <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a retired soldier in the <UNK> <UNK> during a <UNK> lesson the sergeant is more <UNK> in the traditional sense than any other male character i remember from dickens the <UNK> money <UNK> and <UNK> is screaming <UNK> from his seat and the sergeant turns towards him and does one delicate exercise with the <UNK> after another each <UNK> bringing him closer to his <UNK> while the scarlet faced old <UNK> <UNK> back into his seat br br a couple of things are missing often dickens will stick in at least one or two amusing lines of dialog <UNK> or the law is a ass not here bleak house is the right title second there are practically no <UNK> ideal types no mr <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> or <UNK> third the atmosphere the whole <UNK> is relentlessly dismal one <UNK> follows another usually having to do with money or some shameful <UNK> out of the past br br my god it's depressing it's as if the author were <UNK> his <UNK> on everything he hated in the world he knew poverty okay he knew poverty but one wonders what the <UNK> did to dickens to deserve this kind of treatment br br maybe i should add that i've just watched the first episode of the 2005 series and it's better in two ways there is more <UNK> in the direction so the pace is a little faster and the business of <UNK> vs <UNK> is explained <UNK> right up front instead of lurking about in the shadows as that mysterious curse so the plot is easier to follow
<START> hal hartley's henry fool was an independent film masterpiece and certainly his best work it has immense character depth subtle complicated dialogue and an excellent emotional ending which <UNK> i remember <UNK> it several times during my first viewing to <UNK> what i was seeing and feeling henry fool was a complete movie from start to finish and needed no sequel br br thus i was surprised when i heard about fay grim fay was not one of the main characters of the first film and seemed to exist more as the <UNK> <UNK> of real world vanity and ignorance for her brother simon to be forced to deal with as he <UNK> in her own movie fay <UNK> herself though her maturity takes a very different road simon went from near <UNK> isolation to a merely somewhat <UNK> genius fay starts her adult journey as an immature utterly normal spoiled child and responds to the <UNK> of ridiculous circumstances by becoming a mature utterly normal experienced adult who holds no <UNK> she deals with problems the way any human does with determination a little thought and weary disdain while simon learned to control his mind fay learns to control her emotion br br the movie contains several <UNK> remembered elements of its prequel but <UNK> vastly in tone for most of the film henry fool showed you a harsh boring ignorant world which <UNK> with simon's inner passion and creativity in fay grim the world is a lively crazy emotional place which shows the silliness of her young life and through contrast <UNK> the inner wise woman which had not been previously developed or <UNK> by her similarly weak mother br br the movie is in two parts the first dealing with the beginning of <UNK> struggle and subsequent <UNK> due to <UNK> <UNK> and the second dealing with her battle to <UNK> only just enough to regain henry at first fans of henry fool may find themselves wondering how the movie can even be considered a sequel and thinking it is <UNK> to follow such an intense film with spy game antics and physical comedy but this is where the subtlety of fay grim lies the sequel is about <UNK> journey and as i said before hers is one of finding the life giving sanity in chaos not the creative chaos in <UNK> order parker posey is an excellent actress who captures hal hartley's tongue in cheek humor perfectly <UNK> <UNK> perhaps <UNK> her in emotional commitment to the role allowing parker to play both straight man and comic against the lively stage like comedy happening around her br br with the entrance of henry into the picture the movie begins to take a <UNK> turn hal hartley's movies are all plays and every play must come full circle by the end you are shown <UNK> newly developed character and integrity are the <UNK> of her time with the <UNK> intense henry whose <UNK> honesty and unique passion lights a spark in anyone he meets br br fay grim is an excellent movie which does not <UNK> henry fool but shows through <UNK> range that the nuances of his art are the proof of his genius br br honestly i think anyone who <UNK> this movie not only missed the point by a mile and especially the subtlety in parker <UNK> acting but could not have been much interested the movie henry fool
<START> let me start by saying that i'd read a number of reviews before renting this film and kind of knew what to expect still i was surprised by just how bad it was br br i am a big werewolf fan and have grown <UNK> to <UNK> a great deal when watching one most of them have sub par effects poor acting and weak <UNK> at best <UNK> from earlier films so far with the possible exception of some of the later howling series films this is the worst of the lot br br first the story it's been <UNK> several times in reviews on this site so i won't go into <UNK> however it is very obvious that the writer s had absolutely no <UNK> for <UNK> monsters as so often happens when a horror film is given to a writer who considers themselves above such fare they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolf <UNK> that's fine but a non horror fan trying to do this generally has disregard for the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing down to them the plot feels like a parody of werewolf films and the events depicted just ring so false that i felt my intelligence was being seriously insulted tv news footage for example never pans away from the reporter to close up on someone in the crowd behind them give the characters and the viewers credit for being able to spot the bad guy in the scene without using a flashing <UNK> sign and that's just the tip of the iceberg br br as for effects i have never seen a less believable werewolf i'd have been happier with <UNK> <UNK> jr in <UNK> hair the beast they used look a great deal like well like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glued on and some truly awful <UNK> and i know that many people have already criticized the cg but my god it was awful one scene features a woman changing and starts with a completely cg version of the actress nude but for some reason without <UNK> my first thought was hey why is one of the characters from <UNK> turning into a silly looking werewolf br br anyway i like to look for <UNK> in any film and there were a few the cinematography was passable the film was shot all digital which is interesting and some of the performances were not terrible it was also interesting seeing <UNK> <UNK> as the world's most well made up homeless woman and kane <UNK> as the title bad guy also the yellow power ranger got all <UNK> up and well damn and if you're looking for skin there's some pretty tasty examples this ends the male pig segment of the review br br overall if you want a good werewolf film try an american werewolf in london the original the howling dog soldiers or even the <UNK> though that one's got more wolf than were if you're a <UNK> <UNK> then take a <UNK> otherwise give this one a miss
<START> the premise of this movie has been <UNK> my imagination for quite some time now we've all heard or read about it in some kind of con text what would you do if you were all alone in the world what would you do if the entire world suddenly disappeared in front of your eyes in fact the last part is actually what happens to dave and andrew two room mates living in a run down house in the middle of a <UNK> system andrew is a nervous wreck to say the least and dave is considered being one of the biggest losers of society that alone is the main reason to why these two guys get so well along because they simply only have each other to turn to when <UNK> is needed just until br br straight from the beginning of the film lots and lots of problems happen to them both of them get involved with crime andrew suffers from paranoia and simply doesn't dare going out of the house dave is <UNK> at his job and his colleagues don't treat him very well and with the respect he deserves the amount of problems they face keeps increasing until that one day where they may have to face the inevitable and deal with it this is just too much for them and they wish that everything would just go away and of course that is exactly what happens br br the rest of the story places dave and andrew in this world of <UNK> at first they are surprised and have problems understanding and dealing with the features of this crazy environment but later on they find out that they can do just about everything they want because it seems as if they are the only ones still left br br nothing features an incredibly small cast in fact besides the first couple of shots from the film we only see dave david <UNK> and andrew andrew miller in the entire film it is clear that in order to pull this off the cast has to be more than up for the task because in a world where nothing exists there is nothing that can distract the viewer in any way vincenzo has decided to use a reasonable amount of close up head shots to make it more interesting and it actually works quite well director of photography derek rogers also has a nice way of <UNK> the audience by <UNK> visual information especially at times where a character sees something and <UNK> to it but we don't see it right away br br obviously this can't be an event driven film and it's not much of the action happens outside their house when they move around in the void and that's where some of the most hilarious scenes take place especially in the case of when andrew discovers a candy bar br br now one could be thinking how does nothing look like well it looks like nothing indeed the entire world of nothing is white white no matter in what direction you look this is the weakness of this film after an hour or less it's getting extremely boring to look at and there has to be events to make sure it's more interesting to look at thank god there are some for example at times when the two <UNK> due to the <UNK> of nothing are able to jump really high as if nothing is made out of <UNK> as andrew claims it's fun to see how they are instantly able to use nothing to become gods of their own little society br br one of the best parts of the film is the set production designer <UNK> <UNK> has done a beautiful job in this film the house in which these two guys live is so <UNK> fun to look at still it seems right for these two to be living in a place like this all in all the production design is with no doubt one of the most powerful aspects of this film at it really makes the film worth watching br br however the very best part of the film is the acting both david <UNK> and andrew miller really look like the professional actors they both are the camera is on them for every second of the film and as previously said there are just about no props in the film they are really on a bare stage with plenty of character development and some decent one liners clever dialogue at times hilariously stupid it all works to that end and this really moves the movie away from the low budget area to well crafted <UNK> br br let's talk a little about the visual effects because they are definitely worth mentioning nothing features digital visual effects and <UNK> that equals any modern horror film there's a rather horrifying dream sequence in the film and although the <UNK> have <UNK> that scene completely it's still fun to watch one of the best visual effects in the film is at the end where andrew and dave suddenly discover their powers in this environment they have the abilities to wish everything away so what if they can do it the other way around and make things appear br br nothing is a bright and well lit movie it really helps promoting the idea of them probably being dead this is in fact one of their theories but nothing is a comedy and it slowly destroys its own theory we don't know where they are or what has happened to them we don't know if they will ever get out because the movie ends before we see anything like that the ending by the way is not as good as it could've been it's rather easy to predict what is going to happen still the writers have thought up a few incidents that help make it a little more interesting and in the end it's a reasonably satisfactory one br br take hollow man kill bill cube <UNK> and lots of other films and you have nothing it really is an <UNK> of different styles still there is no other film at least that i know of nothing is really like for the people remembering the original cube production commentary on its dvd may remember that vincenzo natali talked about how he came up with the story of cube he talks about him and <UNK> <UNK> having been room mates at a time and they both were in this extremely dull room with no hope of getting out nothing could very well be the screened version of the origin of the cube story and to that end it's almost like one of the cube <UNK> br br what can i say i enjoyed nothing it is a great movie and the different parts of the movie are extremely well made with tons of intelligent ideas still i feel the movie is missing something and i have problems finding out precisely what it is maybe if we have a nothing 2 i can answer that question nothing is a great film but not as good as i expected it to be br br final rating 7 5 10
<START> the progression of the plot is enough to rope one in and create curiosity about the outcome however ultimately the feeling that remains is that the producers of the movie forgot to end it if the intention was to create a <UNK> circle occasionally done in the twilight zone it was too sloppy to view as a positive effort
<START> i think hollow point is a funny film with some good moments i have never seen before in action movies well both <UNK> <UNK> and thomas ian griffith aren't so good in acting but <UNK> <UNK> is nice and good looking girl isn't it but donald sutherland is superb in his role so so mad gangster
<START> i <UNK> pictures that try something different many films just seem like re <UNK> of old ideas so that is the big reason i so strongly recommend <UNK> to <UNK> br br the movie is set just after ww2 and the post war <UNK> and <UNK> seem to be driving <UNK> <UNK> the film centers on a tiny neighborhood in london called <UNK> they too are sick of not being able to buy what they want but can see no way out of it that is until they accidentally stumble upon a hidden treasure and a <UNK> which officially named this neighborhood as a <UNK> nation many hundreds of years ago with this document they reason they can <UNK> all the <UNK> and <UNK> and live life just as they want since it turns out they really aren't british subjects where the movie goes from there and how the crisis is ultimately resolved is something you'll need to see for yourselves leave it up the brilliant minds of ealing studios to come up with this gem
<START> it was disgusting and painful what a waste of a cast i swear the audience 1 2 full laughed twice in 90 minutes this is not a lie do not even rent it br br zeta jones was just too mean to be believable br br cusack was ok just ok i felt sorry for him the actor in case people remember this mess br br roberts was the same as she always is charming and sweet but with no purpose the romance with john was completely unbelievable
<START> <UNK> japan is a really fun show and i really like it it was shown in our country just recently in hero tv and <UNK> <UNK> every 5 30 it is about <UNK> <UNK> who is trying to fulfill his dream to make japanese bread that will represent his country he is working in the southern <UNK> branch of <UNK> and he is also helping his friend <UNK> <UNK> along with other <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> to beat st pierre and take control of <UNK> they fight other <UNK> <UNK> from many other countries and not only learn to make different kinds of bread but also learn to cook other food it is a really funny and unique anime because they also <UNK> characters from other anime like <UNK> detective conan and one piece and famous people from real life it is one of the best works of takashi <UNK> and is really a must see for people of different ages
<START> <UNK> <UNK> is one of the best horror movies already made in the movie's industry i think it is very scary as very few movies actually are alison parker is a model with some fame she dates a lawyer called michael <UNK> and has as a best friend another model called jennifer everything was great in her life until she decides to live alone for some time and <UNK> a beautiful and old apartment br br the problem are her neighbors who are very very strange suddenly alison starts to have health problems and <UNK> with <UNK> she also remembers some painful facts about her past that makes her have nightmares or <UNK> but everything has a reason and it has to do with the new house she is living br br i personally find <UNK> <UNK> a very creepy movie and along with <UNK> <UNK> they are two of the scariest movies i already watched when we discover that <UNK> house is only occupied by the priest and herself my blood <UNK> it's also horrible to see that she needs to become blind in the end of the movie in order to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world
<START> first of all <UNK> is wonderful good comedy and mystery thriller at the same time nice combination of strange <UNK> style of telling the story together with good music and great actors but unfortunately there's no 'the <UNK> as for me it's <UNK> i was thinking how it will be possible to continue the story without <UNK> and <UNK> and i have some idea i think lars should make <UNK> iii a little bit different i'm sure that 3rd part without <UNK> wouldn't be the same so here's my suggestion <UNK> little bit stupid maybe not i know that lars likes to experiment so why not to make small experiment with <UNK> i think the only solution here is to create puppet driven animation like for example team america by <UNK> parker or even computer 3d animation i know it's not the same as real actors but in principle i believe it could work only this way it's possible to make actors alive again for <UNK> fans this shouldn't be so big difference if the animation will be done in good way average <UNK> will consider it normal just after first few shots of the movie the most important thing now is the story it's completely understandable that it's not possible to create <UNK> 3 with the actors nowadays so why not to play with animation and look for the possibilities that it gives to you even marketing one great director finishes his trilogy after 10 years using puppet animation just dreams br br i hope to see <UNK> 3 someday or even to see just the script i'm curious how the story ends and as i expect everybody here do br br <UNK> <UNK> br br ps i'm not talking about the kingdom hospital by stephen king
<START> this movie is a journey through the mind of a screenwriter caught in his own <UNK> philosophy he <UNK> the ever <UNK> question of <UNK> am <UNK> and <UNK> is i ' it's a courageous and thought provoking enterprise there is a <UNK> of beautiful images dream inspired <UNK> like <UNK> reminiscent of the hand drawing itself or rather <UNK> itself more and more we follow the writer in his agony over what to say and what to film we see him <UNK> with his wife who left for <UNK> leaving him to take care of their baby a task he performs with less and less attention until he's so absorbed in his <UNK> that he hardly looks at the child anymore his wife comes back and makes a scene destroys his notes and helping him go over the last <UNK> until he <UNK> him self interspersed with eye pleasing and i <UNK> images the story is mainly philosophical it's about the <UNK> of <UNK> the world of illusion the <UNK> of the movie however is that it needs a lot of talking and thinking to prove that thinking should stop during the more than two hours of provocative beauty and rapid <UNK> the movie made me long for silence or a shorter movie if that was the purpose of the maker he succeeded quite well
<START> i have to totally disagree with the other comment concerning this movie the visual effects <UNK> the supernatural themes of the movie and do not detract from the plot furthermore i loved how this move was unlike <UNK> tiger because this time the sword action had no strings attached and most of the time you can see the action up close br br i think western audiences will be very confused with 2 scenes one of which involves a monk trying to burn himself alive and the other concerning the villagers <UNK> that it is the end of the world the mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of <UNK> <UNK> text <UNK> <UNK> can be found in china korea and japan and the other scene deals with a <UNK> in the japanese <UNK> people back then really thought that the world would come to an end <UNK> has the action story and visuals to <UNK> any viewer i strongly believe that with some <UNK> editing it can be sold in the u s my one complaint is in the last fight scene i can't give anything away sorry
<START> does anyone know where or how i can get a copy of this film i've been searching for way too long someone help back in 1997 my girlfriends and i were extras on this long island based film and we actually never got to see it br br i was hoping i could find a copy somehow so i can finally check it out and share it with the girls is there anyone out there who knows where to get a copy of this so i can stop driving myself crazy also it doesn't matter if its in in vhs format i'm still in the ice age myself if you or anyone you know has a copy of this film please help i would be willing to pay for a good copy of it
<START> the <UNK> is a witty dark <UNK> and suspenseful melodrama that rises way above mediocrity thanks to two very engaging and earnest performances from pierce brosnan who has never ever been better than here and the always reliable greg kinnear who has his best role here since playing jack <UNK> gay neighbor in as good as it gets a big plus goes to the writing as well clever and occasionally very nasty dialog is delivered with gusto by brosnan and the slow building friendship between these two different individuals is completely convincing all the way the story takes a few unexpected turns and keeps the viewer constantly guessing where it's gonna go next br br nice artistic touches from the director such as good use of music clever editing and somewhat <UNK> cinematography at times set a nice tone for the film and for a long period of time you don't quite know how to label the film but that's also thanks to a very well written script which keeps the viewer me anyway on the edge of his seat
<START> this film was not only one of john ford's own personal favorites but also <UNK> directors <UNK> m <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> among its high profile <UNK> ironically i've just caught up with it myself via <UNK> recent 2 disc set after missing out on a couple of original language <UNK> of it on italian tv many years ago and again a few times on tv while in hollywood br br the film marked ford's first of nine <UNK> with henry fonda and is also a quintessential example of ford's <UNK> <UNK> vein a beautifully made and <UNK> quite poetic piece of work the courtroom sequences and eventual revelation in its second half still pack quite a <UNK> apart from giving <UNK> character actor donald meek a <UNK> <UNK> role as the <UNK> attorney br br fonda is of course perfectly cast as a <UNK> inexperienced but <UNK> and <UNK> lawyer who was destined to become president fonda would go on to portray other <UNK> politicians on film most notably in franklin j <UNK> the best man 1964 and sidney <UNK> fail safe 1964 and it's surprising now to learn that he was reluctant at the time about accepting the role of lincoln since in his view that was like playing god br br it is interesting to note here that ford had previously <UNK> abraham lincoln <UNK> in the prisoner of shark island 1936 a superb but perhaps little known gem which has luckily just been released as a special edition dvd by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> stand in <UNK> masters of cinema label besides i also have two more abraham lincoln films in my dvd collection which i've yet to watch and incidentally both were directed by d w griffith the birth of a nation <UNK> and abraham lincoln 1930 and had i not just received a bunch of films i've never watched before just now i would have gladly given them a spin based on my highly satisfying viewing experience with young mr lincoln
<START> this movie is about a fictional soap opera it is very fast and funny to say anything else would ruin the movie there are several plots and sub plots in the movie this movie has ensemble cast with today's <UNK> stars they all gives over the top performances this movie is favorite of mine from the year 1991 <UNK> is perfect for fans of either daytime soap opera or prime time soap opera if you watch soap go check this movie it's hilarious
<START> did anyone else notice whenever they are in the car each time the camera takes a new angle they switch roads like in one scene it is a one lane <UNK> with <UNK> next they are on a multiple lane highway with a <UNK> next a two lane country road with double yellow <UNK> i can understand a low budget but that was just sloppy film work br br i also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie i think that if you are a fan of paul reiser and his comedy then you may enjoy this movie if however you find his work not funny then i would recommend staying away from this one
<START> i recently found a copy for 5 at a video store and <UNK> it up eagerly while the music and obviously graphics aren't up to the standards of my favorite of the series beyond the <UNK> eye i am still <UNK> by one segment br br stanley and stella in breaking the ice the music is brilliant and the emotions feel real the clip on <UNK> website doesn't have the story nor the music unfortunately
<START> so angela has grown up and gotten therapy and an operation to turn her into a real life daughter rather than the son that she was born and now holds a job as wait for it a camp <UNK> how appropriate right i know i love it anyway the first sequel to the <UNK> camp franchise <UNK> all the rules of horror sequels more blood more imaginative killings which aren't imaginative but still more so than the original more nudity a more elaborate plot and generally worse than the original br br it is entertaining in the same way as the original was in that the characters and <UNK> are so goofy and so <UNK> 80's that you can't help getting a good laugh at one point a guy asks angela out and she says i'll call you and then quickly walks away the guy says to himself how is she gonna call me i don't have a phone and then he <UNK> his <UNK> wondering what turned her off it's the hair dude br br it is a well known fact that in 80s slasher movies the murdered teenagers were more often than not being <UNK> by their killer for some kind of bad behavior usually for being too <UNK> when i first started getting into horror movies and saw the friday the 13th movies for the first time in the mid 90s i didn't realize this i learned it in a film class a year or two later and was amazed that their was some method to the madness i was pretty impressed not only that the movies were passing on some kind of message albeit a morbid one but that there was actually some thought put into it br br but not in this movie at one point just before angela kills one of her victims she says let this be a lesson to you say no to drugs real subtle screen writing there guys then again the dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the movie angela who by the way went through all that therapy and those <UNK> and all that trouble to clean up her past and <UNK> herself as a normal and well developed person and then changed her name from angela to <UNK> angela says at one point i don't like being the wicked witch of the west but i know what happens when things get out of control people start getting killed by me ha br br then later she demands that one of the <UNK> <UNK> make an <UNK> to which the girl replies i'd rather die sorry <UNK> but you really walked into that one br br two years ago i was a camp <UNK> at a <UNK> camp similar to the one portrayed in this movie except the camp that i taught at had more than three kids to the 15 or 20 <UNK> and it also had rules which the one in the movie doesn't this made me notice the <UNK> of <UNK> in the movie from what camp life is really like br br that's okay though you can hardly make a movie like this with a lot of 9 year olds running around although there were some 10 or 11 year old kids killed in this movie i hadn't seen that kind of thing much before br br definitely bad taste even for a cheesy 80s slasher movie
<START> don't be <UNK> by the <UNK> this is a wonderfully spooky film this was a <UNK> project for the writer director <UNK> petty he did a great job of having me on the edge of my seat i never really knew what to expect and for a jaded horror movie goer this is <UNK> the film concerns an elderly man who lives in a isolated <UNK> cabin in the woods one day while searching for his cat in the woods he witnesses the murder of a child or does he he <UNK> about this the rest of the film what is most unusual about this film is that here is no dialogue until the last few scenes i found this to be intriguing the writer manages to get hold of your senses and gives them a relentless <UNK> give this film a go you won't be disappointed
<START> br br there is star trek <UNK> lots of it from <UNK> we know the history of the future advances in technology events places first contacts with new beings names dates etc br br enterprise pretty much <UNK> much of st <UNK> an unfortunate fact for long time serious fans as one i assumed that the producers would at least take a look at the first few episodes of <UNK> and retro back from there but no br br the phase <UNK> like much of the technology look much more modern than found in <UNK> an old style <UNK> laser gun a slow gold <UNK> <UNK> effect that's what i expected to see also i did not expect to hear pure <UNK> based sound effects similar to <UNK> but far apart from <UNK> sound effects br br in the earliest view of <UNK> the original pilot the cage we see a <UNK> with a more <UNK> military aspect a bit of old earth navy with enterprise we see a shocking disregard for rank there is more military code in the cartoon star <UNK> than in enterprise br br it is fine that captain archer is unsure about the needs of the universe quite unlike kirk who never lacked confidence in his <UNK> of human justice but inside enterprise everyone seems like an equal <UNK> unsure more distant from the feel of <UNK> military service than found in any st series and that says a lot br br the casual country music opening theme song <UNK> the <UNK> of a family rather than the adventures of an important large military <UNK> br br enterprise looks to show us a mostly fun warm fuzzy exploration of human relationships rather than take us on a historic bold gritty high rick exploration of space br br i would have selected adrian paul to play the captain and an older human to be the doctor still i liked the actors for the most part linda park an outstanding ballroom dancer from boston college is sure to develop nicely the characters making up the crew seem to be <UNK> created br br enterprise begins its run stronger than did the past three star trek series let's hope for a good future
<START> i was totally <UNK> in this film from the first to last minute it is brilliantly shot with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed the plot <UNK> a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike she hires an assistant at work with her true intention being to find love he's an ex con and she takes advantage of him to <UNK> revenge on those who have hurt her in return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off the film <UNK> into a dark film noir with a couple of truly excellent scenes and an even better finale the real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character's <UNK> the use of sound keeps the tension consistent and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood <UNK> that's for sure throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual <UNK> you've got the <UNK> of a great film it's the sort of film hollywood really wants to make but just can't
<START> this movie was probably the worst movie i have ever seen here are the things that immediately jump out at me 1 the woods were more like hills in los angeles with a couple trees and brush not scary whatsoever news flash if you are filming in the southern california area big bear is only an hour away they actually have trees there br br 2 the writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue i have ever experienced every possible line in the movie was unoriginal cliché or just plain stupid for instance the name of the camp is camp blood lame the name of the clown is the killer clown lame what is a clown doing in a forest anyway was that the only mask they could find 3 the last but certainly the least was the acting absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled a virtual <UNK> of <UNK> lines and poor acting worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph it's a really long scene and i guess she was supposed to be sexy but she was not also and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me was this tool who is supposed to be athletic for instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing <UNK> with them then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very girl like run that he is quite far from athletic oh and to the girl who played <UNK> good lord stop singing that song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself br br if for some reason you do see this movie i would at least recommend watching the special features the group of <UNK> who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story in fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending apparently she hangs out with special kids
<START> how do comments like the one that was the <UNK> by high school girls even make it on this site this was the stupidest movie i have ever seen it was ridiculous how can any moron sit there and say that just because a movie makes you jump it is a good movie that might be the most idiotic thing i have ever heard i could sneak up behind you and go boo and it would make you jump but that does not mean i am <UNK> to write or direct a movie not to mention they tied everything together at the end is not a good reason for a movie to be well received what kind of movie would it be if they didn't tie everything together i guess that would make it half a movie not a whole movie so basically this idiot girl is <UNK> them for finishing the movie well i love how the youth of today hold the media and production companies to such a high standard no wonder the political system of this country can get away with whatever they want we have idiots like that coming up in our country what would happen if this girl actually ends up leading something someday that is a scary thought get a life and go watch a real movie sometime try <UNK> redemption or on the <UNK> or something like that and don't comment that it was boring after you see it just use what little brain god gave you to analyze it a little
<START> this film has a lot of raw potential the script is sharp the dialogue is usually excellent though it could stand to lose the <UNK> voice overs the direction and cinematography is surprisingly quite good though some of the <UNK> just doesn't work the main problem here is david duchovny once a geek boy always a geek boy and the sad simple fact is that he's incapable of playing anything but fox <UNK> he <UNK> he tries to be slick he poses he tries to be macho in the end he just tries too hard he <UNK> his character he <UNK> his lines and he's just <UNK> in all ways by timothy <UNK> and angelina jolie who are each in a class above him in terms of acting skill timothy <UNK> was as always really good there was a <UNK> moment or two where he over <UNK> his role but you could tell he was having fun with it he looked the part and he became the character both physically and <UNK> angelina jolie was also really good she didn't have much of a role in fact i though she could have used a much stronger one her character wasn't nearly developed enough though she did remarkably well with what she had and the chemistry between her and <UNK> was apparent gee maybe that's why uma left him all in all it was rough around the edges but a solid effort by a good cast and great supporting roles if david duchovny hadn't ripped his role to pieces it would've been that much better 7 10
<START> this is the worst ripoff of home alone movies that i have ever seen watch part 1 and two but don't let anyone say that this is better than the first two i mean really you don't make a movie then make a sequel with the same characters and actors and then make another sequel with different characters and actors i mean it would have been ok if this <UNK> a home alone movie but they did make it a home alone movie culkin is too old now so you're suppose to stop making sequels goodness this movie makes me sick buy part 1 and 2
<START> anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the <UNK> everyone says star wars and star trek are the best science fiction films to begin at which is fine but the truth is the terminator and this movie soylent green are far better choices than those series soylent is probably science fiction 's best kept secret it remains one of the biggest yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day charlton heston <UNK> his role yet it works edward g robinson in his final role makes the most out of it in soylent green more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching br br it is manhattan in <UNK> the world is <UNK> and food is an unbelievable fortune a small jar of <UNK> jam costs 150 a big executive for the soylent company is murdered and police detective thorn is on the case br br the secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie soylent is enjoyable to watch but the whole screenplay is a joke it is just as cheap as the entire production the screenplay and the over <UNK> of the actors made the movie yet were completely hilarious everyone seems to be a moron and no one knows the rules specifically cop thorn who likes to just <UNK> into people 's apartments <UNK> around shamelessly and steal anything he wants the character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie but still you realize that soylent green sucks an enjoyable piece if you have the time but do not expect anything more
<START> in this movie the year <UNK> looks much like the seventies this is amusing at first but soon the viewer <UNK> how very different that <UNK> futuristic world is despite the appearances how many things that we take for granted could become <UNK> br br characters often interact in a peculiar way with no <UNK> or manners or respect i believe this is intentional not bad acting after all who witnessed the social changes in the 60s and 70s may well assume that by <UNK> an <UNK> city's inhabitants behave like that br br i didn't like most of the action scenes apart the death of the priest too cheap even for the seventies the plot isn't too polished but the great scenes and ideas like the death of <UNK> the way <UNK> and dead bodies are dealt with the furniture <UNK> the shortcomings of this film br br 8 out of 10
<START> what a disappointment especially in light of the budget provided the technical resources available and the talent assembled isn't the fundamental rule for science fiction drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief <UNK> 2001 creates a plausible beginning <UNK> us in but <UNK> mr burton forgets that his <UNK> have working brains the over the top <UNK> of helena bonham <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> the ease of their escape their extraordinary skills of <UNK> this is an astronaut and a group of human <UNK> suddenly riding full <UNK> the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable mark <UNK> never once projects any sense of real fear danger or <UNK> in this world turned upside down compare to the original in which chuck <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> captured his utter <UNK> and <UNK> at his turn of events the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> his modesty but also his apparent sense of management and control in an <UNK> wacky situation and we never really wonder about his well being unlike heston he seems never to be in real <UNK> tim burton should have used some of the f x budget for some competent <UNK> in fact after this inferior fiasco i wonder why hollywood's producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike <UNK> let them walk trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in planet of the apes 2001 i'll bet the repeat viewings of this effort will be nonexistent it could have been a new franchise and a wonderful new step for imagination another opportunity lost
<START> certainly any others i have seen pale in comparison the series gives balanced coverage to all theatres of operation no one country is given <UNK> credit for the allied victory laurence olivier brings great weight and dignity to his role as narrator
<START> if i had known this movie was filmed in the <UNK> and <UNK> inducing <UNK> 95 style i would never have rented it nevertheless i took a <UNK> for the <UNK> and gave it a shot i lasted a very very very long forty minutes before giving up it's just boring pretentious <UNK> br br the last french movie i saw was romance and it too was pretty dismal but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the <UNK> of the characters all the time i am <UNK> at the continuing popularity of <UNK> 95 overseas it'll catch on in america about the same time as the next big <UNK> of <UNK> it's called <UNK> 95 because that's the average number of times the actors are <UNK> in the eye by the camera br br
<START> in august 1980 the disappearance of baby <UNK> chamberlain and the <UNK> trial of her parents lindy and michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an <UNK> across what was then a very angry nation the media and the public had already tried and convicted the accused couple and were <UNK> for blood what followed was a gross <UNK> of justice br br michael and lindy chamberlain claimed that while camping near <UNK> rock central australia that a <UNK> had taken their ten week old daughter from their <UNK> as they were preparing to eat in the <UNK> area no one believed them lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and michael as an <UNK> after the fact the whole country was <UNK> with <UNK> of a ritual killing the <UNK> trial was over before it began br br lindy never proved her innocence so she was found guilty there was never enough evidence to convict her yet the jury was <UNK> by public and media pressure how could we as a nation even sit in judgement from where we are how could we possibly presume to know unless there was absolute proof and no reasonable doubt whatsoever the <UNK> should have been <UNK> br br fred <UNK> film <UNK> and whole <UNK> supports the argument of john <UNK> novel that the <UNK> were completely innocent of the charges laid against them that in fact a <UNK> did take baby <UNK> on that <UNK> night at <UNK> rock br br <UNK> has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood <UNK> nation hell bent on 'the <UNK> being brought to light he shows australia in a rather <UNK> light as a people who were totally obsessed with seeing the <UNK> pay his screenplay co written with robert <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the emotions and will most certainly find the audience <UNK> and <UNK> at the travesty of justice which occurred br br the outstanding meryl streep gives an incredible performance as the woman accused of the most dreadful of acts she brings to life most convincingly the tough little aussie who was ready to stand up to the <UNK> and set the world straight even her accent is almost but not quite spot on a very good effort by the master of that trade sam <UNK> is every bit as good as streep as the at first faithful but then <UNK> michael who cannot comprehend why their world is falling apart and he starts to question his christianity his as was <UNK> is a showing of great emotional strength that will move you profoundly the entire support cast are also excellent with some of <UNK> finest actors and actresses playing a part br br technically the film is brilliant too with director of photography ian baker capturing this great land with <UNK> especially the rock editor jill <UNK> keeps the whole movie tense and very emotionally charged while bruce <UNK> provides a telling score br br for all <UNK> this is a must see a shocking look in the mirror if you will at what we as a country did to a family who just wanted justice to be served and the truth to be known as michael chamberlain said i don't think anybody really understands what innocence means to innocent people br br saturday may 20 1995 video br br even on return viewings fred <UNK> account of the travesty of justice that <UNK> the <UNK> who lost baby <UNK> at <UNK> rock in 1980 is still emotionally powerful and honestly moving br br <UNK> and robert <UNK> have expertly transferred john <UNK> novel to the screen telling with simplicity the horrifying story of a vacation gone terribly wrong for michael and lindy chamberlain whose new born daughter <UNK> was taken form the family <UNK> by a <UNK> just moments after being put down br br amid media <UNK> and vicious public <UNK> lindy was charged with the murder of her baby and michael was charged as an <UNK> after the fact what followed was little more than trial by media and with the australian people determined she be put away lindy was found guilty and sentenced to life <UNK> with hard <UNK> even though the <UNK> could present no motive and little other than <UNK> evidence br br meryl streep is in top form as the accused woman who battles australia head on to prove her innocence she is truly awesome and the only thing that fails her is a true blue aussie accent though she does her level best to sound <UNK> you might wonder why a top australian actress wasn't cast in the role but star power is probably the answer alongside meryl is an equally impressive sam <UNK> outstanding as the husband who sees his world falling apart before his eyes while he feels <UNK> to do anything about it a strong aussie cast lend compelling support br br editing from jill <UNK> is very <UNK> ian <UNK> cinematography of the rock and other rugged locations is visually brilliant and bruce <UNK> music is perfect for the part truly a must for all <UNK> <UNK> br br sunday june 15 1996 video

<START> <UNK> is the kind of worthless flick which just hangs out among the cable channels taking up space like a cheesy dime novel in the public library a worthless bit of tripe and first effort for mediocre director <UNK> the film is <UNK> with bad acting bad sound bad camera work and poor quality in all aspects of the film many better films never make it to market and why junk flicks like this one do and never seem to go away is one of life's great mysteries d
<START> i couldn't have been more thrilled just eight years old back in 1983 i was going to see a star wars movie at the theater the best day of my life was about to happen to that time my only star wars experience had been a few hbo <UNK> of star wars i hadn't even seen the empire strikes back yet br br and boy did that day deliver for my less critical eyes <UNK> big rebel <UNK> the <UNK> a green <UNK> <UNK> wow since that magical day i must have watched this movie hundreds of times i can't even form an accurate <UNK> at this point with those multiple viewings i have of course observed that this movie the real episode iii does have its flaws br br of course in the context of a star wars movie those flaws are more like quirks br br millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980 in may of 1983 i had mine and this was my star wars movie
<START> yes this movie is a real thief it stole some shiny oscars from <UNK> just because politicians wanted another war hero movie to boost the acceptance support for the wars u s is still fighting today i do not really want to go here into politics but come on this is more clear than the summer sky hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding no real plot at all i really feel myself in the 50's of <UNK> when the party told the people what to like and what not to like the same propaganda movies were produced that time only with the exception that those were black and white even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the u s wars are cool genre you surely have much better movies to choose from
<START> i saw this film at the 2005 toronto international film festival based on a <UNK> by science fiction author brian <UNK> this film attempts to tell the story of tom and barry <UNK> <UNK> twins who are <UNK> from their family by an <UNK> in order to form a rock band br br almost deliberately <UNK> the film is also too clever by half if you'll <UNK> the pun by mixing genres styles and <UNK> the directors whose previous film was the excellent documentary lost in la <UNK> lose their way pretty quickly i was never sure whether i was meant to take it all seriously or not flashbacks dream sequences it was all just a bit much plus the promised rock and roll just didn't move me i was reminded a bit too much at times of <UNK> and the angry inch a film i found original and moving but in this case the songs just weren't as good nor were the main characters sympathetic a more <UNK> comparison would be the similarly disappointing <UNK> <UNK>
<START> a heartwarming film the usual superb acting by john <UNK> who passed over recently a man who was always so <UNK> he was one of <UNK> top 10 actors certainly of my time br br he can be remembered for his famous role of inspector morse as jack <UNK> in the 1970's hit tv series 'the <UNK> and as a <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> a must see for all the family and a great dvd for my collection the filming will bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime britain and certainly those who were <UNK> out of london to escape the german <UNK> the interaction between the two main characters tom and the boy william was really well acted and true to the book by michelle <UNK>
<START> godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one and probably the strongest kind that could be made about ralph bakshi's take on <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the lord of the rings has actually been made by peter jackson the recent trilogy to me aren't even total masterpieces but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good sweeping <UNK> br br but as one who has not read the books i end up now looking upon the two versions live action albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way and animated albeit partly done with actual live action as the <UNK> in relation to just the basic story not even complete <UNK> to the books and with bakshi's version it's almost not fair in a way as what we do see is really not the complete vision not what jackson really had probably final cut robbed of return of the king's big climactic rush of the story and with the other two parts becoming rushed i ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations though as such those same limitations make it disappointing br br what's interesting too after seeing the jackson films first which i also slightly regret being that i <UNK> <UNK> to this differently when i was younger and prior to five years ago is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with everything that is really needed to tell the <UNK> of the ring story is actually pretty much intact and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in <UNK> book is given some clarity in this section the actors playing the parts of the <UNK> and the other heroes are more or less adequate for the parts with a few parts standing out john hurt as <UNK> and william <UNK> as <UNK> br br the lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little face value for those who've not even seen the other films or read the books and can't put them into context but there is some level of interest always with the characters and here there's a more old fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more this is not a garden variety disney adaptation <UNK> and all this is a bakshi film with his underground animation roots <UNK> with the mythical world of middle earth br br and what bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen in all its <UNK> form its hit or miss appeal along with being not totally complete as a film or as stories the form of the film is an experiment to see if something can be entirely <UNK> the results end up bringing what seems now to be retro but at the time of course was something that was a rough crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation in some parts yeah it does become a little noticeable as was also the case in bakshi's american pop that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky like some kind of comic book form done in a different way still there's much i admired in what was done br br the <UNK> for example i found to be really amazing in they're surreal surroundings they're maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live action especially during parts where there isn't battle footage that's really the real hit or miss section as there isn't continuity from the good and bad <UNK> and the <UNK> comes through with big <UNK> on top of <UNK> it's creepy in a good way and the backgrounds while also very rough and sometimes too <UNK> are beautiful with the <UNK> and <UNK> of colors together it's almost something for art film buffs as much as for the ring nuts br br so how would i recommend this animated take on the lord of the rings i don't know to tell the truth it's certainly a good notch above the other <UNK> animated film i've seen the <UNK> and i've yet to see the animated <UNK> and there is some real artistry going on there's also some stilted dialog an all too rushed two towers segment with the most intriguing character <UNK> being reduced to maybe two scenes in all and seeing something as <UNK> like this ends up only <UNK> the <UNK> of the more recent films br br if you're a fan of the books <UNK> checking this out i would say it's worth a chance even if it's one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not as for it fitting into bakshi's other films i've seen it's an impressive ambitious and <UNK> achievement where as with lynch's <UNK> it's bound to draw a dark <UNK> like line in the sand between those who hate it <UNK> and those who don't i don't
<START> absolutely one of the worst movies of the year the plot is ridiculous the characters poorly developed and the premise <UNK> stupid it all begins when michael keaton fresh off of doing nothing noteworthy since batman loses his beautiful author wife anna to a car accident possibly caused by her driving one of those <UNK> <UNK> bugs even though she's supposed to be rich in his grief batman moves to a new apartment and takes up a <UNK> recording nothing and then watching it he learned this from a really fat pathetic guy who got murdered by three tall shadowy <UNK> who lived in his tv pretty soon he starts to see dead people thanks to <UNK> or electronic voice phenomenon which is evidently this deal <UNK> dead people can send messages to living people through tape <UNK> video cameras dead cell phones anna cell calling but she's dead must be ghosts <UNK> no other possible explanation i'd better start messing around with this <UNK> etc why they can't just write something down on a piece of paper or knock over some stuff to form creative <UNK> is never explained anyway eventually batman discovers that he's actually seeing the future and he decides to go help this woman he doesn't know he gets out of his house just in the nick of time because the tall dark guys enter just after he leaves d <UNK> it can travel between the living and dead using <UNK> but i'll be d <UNK> if we can be on time am i right guys they nod in <UNK> <UNK> he tracks this lady to a warehouse and finds out that this character from the first ten minutes of the movie look hard or you'll miss him is actually a serial killer working for three tall shadowy demons who in <UNK> of the lost <UNK> style <UNK> down and kill him looking like the cartoons that they are just then some detectives show up and save the lady after <UNK> funeral he decides to send a message from beyond the grave <UNK> to his son for being an idiot evidently feeling that the best way to protect his kid from the horrors of <UNK> is to expose him to it the little kid just smiles nothing <UNK> that dude not even when his dad batman of course starts talking to tv's the high point of the movie was when someone's phone <UNK> and some guy <UNK> out it's anna
<START> this movie is outrageous funny <UNK> sophisticated hits the <UNK> where 99 of hollywood movies don't even make the target paul <UNK> should be recognized as one of the great directors of this or any era he's the american <UNK> <UNK> combined glad i have the <UNK>
<START> saturday june 3 6 <UNK> the <UNK> br br monday june 5 4 <UNK> the <UNK> br br few <UNK> of ethnic and cultural identity succeed as <UNK> as carlos <UNK> brilliant interpretation of <UNK> <UNK> masterpiece <UNK> <UNK> at the approach of its <UNK> <UNK> drew together an <UNK> wealth of talent from the spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their <UNK> the twelve impressions of the <UNK> are presented without narrative in stark surroundings allowing the power of each performance to explode before <UNK> camera creative use of large <UNK> and mirrors moved throughout the set combined with screens shadows fire rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied <UNK> of song dance and <UNK> performance photographs of <UNK> <UNK> throughout the program connecting the passion of the music to its great creator <UNK> <UNK> all <UNK> on his stage from the beautiful <UNK> of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children <UNK> dancing with their <UNK>
<START> <UNK> <UNK> film purple <UNK> <UNK> a secret organization purple <UNK> against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai <UNK> <UNK> zhang <UNK> and her ex lover <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting br br i agree with the reviewer from paris the film <UNK> a convoluted semi historical conflict for a plot without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes the sudden time shifting doesn't help matters as it appears completely <UNK> and pointless normally i don't mind dark movies but the absence of light the bone <UNK> shaky camera footage and the generally bad film making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography but i don't think that helps the movie the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th century and i don't believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a michael bay film the overly melodramatic moments don't add to its <UNK> br br the actors are all suitably melancholy zhang <UNK> once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films brooding and looking generally annoyed however at least she adds some variety to this role by <UNK> and engaging in the worst love making scene since michael <UNK> and linda hamilton in the terminator br br all in all a very disappointing film especially seeing as how it comes from the director of <UNK> he 2 10
<START> this movie is now appearing on digital tv at least once a month i've watched it a dozen or more times and it never <UNK> to delight me if it was on tomorrow i'd watch it again such is the artistry that peter ustinov and maggie smith two great <UNK> of the acting profession can create helped in no small way by the superb supporting trio of karl malden bob <UNK> and robert <UNK> not forgetting others in minor roles br br it is a simple tale simply told of an ex con a lovable <UNK> battling and <UNK> with the then new age technology i e computers and finding affection in the process even if it is a tad tongue in cheek implausible even unbelievable the characters are not there is no violence no sex no bad language and best of all no awful method acting which is so prevalent today a real lesson to modern movie makers on how to make a great show from and with virtually nothing except outstanding talent
<START> don't look for an <UNK> <UNK> here just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this one a gallery of stars pop up as the classic cartoon character's villains in this live action comedy which features incredible makeup and set design not to mention <UNK> performances from beatty madonna and pacino great fun for kids and adults alike br br out of
<START> i only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title it now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films it is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the <UNK> discovered but everything in it works wonderfully it has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are <UNK> on a very private world i fell in love with this film and with the characters in it it is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric <UNK> a true <UNK> family it has a <UNK> atmosphere and i found myself wishing i could be there away from it all cooking my corn on the <UNK> at my <UNK> table it has an air of sadness that <UNK> throughout a fall from greatness for this once <UNK> family the money had gone but their <UNK> and <UNK> remained as well as their beauty it drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished i found myself wondering about their fate wondering that if i took a walk along east <UNK> beach i might still hear old <UNK> voice in the night and see the <UNK> of little edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging <UNK> unforgettable
<START> if you ask me the first one was really better one look at sarah m g she is real mean cruel girl look at amy adams she is just little fool hanging around she is nothing people don't adore her second sebastian was cute and hot in first movie now he is baby face story is not that good and i do not understand why didn't they make this one first it is the beginning <UNK> actors nothing with story this is not cruel this is playing first one has better actors better story and its mean i think that the music is better in cruel intentions 1 and the music is better in cruel intentions 3 it is not the worst movie i saw but in <UNK> with first one its one big big big nothing
<START> anyone witness to our justice system or lack thereof will find this film truly satisfying there weren't too many shades of gray with regard to characters or plot virtually every character in this film <UNK> what is best and worst about our society the popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have had to deal with <UNK> along with the <UNK> <UNK> lily <UNK> <UNK> mouthed <UNK> that <UNK> them in the name of political correctness br br the performances across the board were compelling i <UNK> with the rape victim while at the same found it <UNK> to see her wipe the smug vicious arrogance off the faces of her former <UNK> in particular i found the dyke one of the <UNK> characters in all of the films i've seen so it was nice to see her former victim shut her mouth for good the lead rapist and psychopath was equally ugly so it was only fitting that dirty harry himself <UNK> him in a loud grotesque fashion in the end this was the only sequel in the dirty harry saga that <UNK> the first
<START> this is the first film of the <UNK> i have watched and after im almost thinking i don't need to see any of the others i was told its a thinking mans horror movie and have to say that if this was supposed to make me think i <UNK> to think what the splatter gore films in the collection will be like don't get me wrong not even the gore in this film is worth sitting through br br the plot is very washed out with way too much art for arts sake the camera effects and music are out of place most of the time and the characters are banal to say the least several characters and scenes seem worthless in the end when they start to reveal some of the <UNK> of the <UNK> i figured out who <UNK> was about half hour in when i figured out the movie i was so visually under <UNK> and confused by the <UNK> reveal that i completely felt ripped off i expected what i got but they could have gone so much further in fact all the gore falls completely flat with movies out there like hostel and saw you need to come a little better for a film that is considered to graphic or too disturbing for general audiences
<START> this movie just goes to show that you dont need big explosions <UNK> billion dollar computer graphics or highly over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie all you need is a excellent story line and plot which the master of all japanese films <UNK> kurosawa pulls off brilliantly i recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece and for those that enjoy <UNK> earlier works 10 10
<START> bugs life is a good film but to me it doesn't really compare to movies like toy story and stuff don't get me wrong i liked this movie but it wasn't as good as toy story the film has the visuals the laughs and others that toy story had but the film didn't feel quite as i don't know but i thought it was still a pretty good film br br a bugs life i don't want to say this is a film that i don't remember i saw it years ago of course i haven't seen toy story in years but i still remember it i shouldn't have reviewed this film but i am i am giving it a thumbs up though it's not exactly the best work pixar has done br br a bug's life
<START> the good news is a movie was made drawing on a supposed aztec myth and featuring an unusually aztec american is such a word exists cast the bad news is it was dead at birth br br if ed wood had come out of retirement and <UNK> george <UNK> through his classic <UNK> of the living dead ' this is what we might have come up with 'the legend of <UNK> is clearly fodder for any future <UNK> of <UNK> science theatre 3000 ' br br i don't think one can even call this a <UNK> movie the production values are so abysmal that i kept getting the feeling i was watching either a lengthy skit from a variety show or a backyard 8 <UNK> film shot by a group of school kids br br some spoilers br br the basic plot line sounded interesting enough to lure me into renting it a rural california sheriff finds a box containing an aztec demon and accidentally <UNK> it on the unsuspecting community his daughters one hot and one <UNK> team with a <UNK> fbi man and a priest to try to re cage the demon br br meanwhile every zombie scene one has ever seen in previous undead movies is re <UNK> poorly these zombies walk more like an army of nutty <UNK> than the undead the supposed <UNK> scenes from the <UNK> viewpoint are nothing special  and he she it sure seems to back up a lot as opposed to turning around the moving forward and the scene where the priest <UNK> the demon out of the cave in fast motion is ludicrous it really really appears to be done for comic effect although i know it wasn't i kept expecting the benny hill theme music to start playing for the whole gang of zombies to start chasing the priest all over the beach br br of course the darth vader field of dreams voice calling the fbi agent becomes downright comical then again so was most of this cheese ball robert <UNK> director and writer of the screenplay should win something for this effort how about a lifetime <UNK> like the <UNK> 10 ' this one i now see is rated 1 5 on a 10 scale i fear this might be a tad generous br br is there anything good about this movie well lindsey <UNK> looks pretty hot as the younger daughter of the dead sheriff this is probably why her <UNK> older sister <UNK> <UNK> really ran away from home fred <UNK> is reasonably decent as the fbi agent i wonder if mario <UNK> who played father rodriguez is the same mario <UNK> who pitched for the <UNK> <UNK> if so he should have stuck to baseball in fact they couldn't have done any worse if they had gone with a baseball theme and called it <UNK> in the <UNK> ' br br if i find out this was actually a project for a community college cinema class i will issue apologies it might be good enough for a b or even b as long as the gang got the <UNK> camcorder back to campus in one piece 'the blair witch <UNK> proved that a cool campy movie could be made on a <UNK> 'the legend of <UNK> ' though didn't appear to have a <UNK> or shoes to work from it was low budget low talent low everything the very final scene and i mean about the final 10 seconds of the film is the only mildly creative or interesting moment br br i paid 3 45 to rent this i could have better spent it on a <UNK>
<START> when an actor has to play the role of an actor fictional or factual the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role in a double life ronald coleman <UNK> himself as anthony john the tortured double personality he put into that character all his talent and sincerity the facial expressions mannerisms <UNK> and stance spoke <UNK> of what anthony john was going through while playing othello on stage coleman also did extremely well as a shakespearean actor in those short scenes as othello that were part of this gem of a movie <UNK> of <UNK> face as othello tortured by doubts about the <UNK> of <UNK> were in themselves scenes worth watching add to that his character's off stage desperation and only someone with <UNK> depth of acting perception can achieve it was like watching <UNK> tracy as dr <UNK> and mr hyde except this double role was much more profound and poignant <UNK> winters looked so sweet vulnerable and gorgeous at the same time and added her talent to the movie it is believed that ronald coleman liked his role in this film above all others he played and went on to win the oscar for best actor in <UNK> i would see this movie repeatedly and never feel bored
<START> i'm giving it only 9 out of 10 because i need to view it again in a more current mind frame to have a fresh perspective what i remember is an amazing psychological thriller that <UNK> my brain and my eyes when i watched it i would watch it every time it came on hbo back in the day probably 1990 or so i might have even recorded it but that recording is long gone i'm sure br br i wrote to <UNK> to try and get this title in they currently don't carry it i hope i can find it at a local video store br br i would highly recommend giving it a try if you find it somewhere it's interesting at the very least if you enjoyed movies such as edward <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> or anything sort of strange and along those lines try this one out
<START> this is one of those rare movies it's lovely and compelling <UNK> and quirky a true gift i consider it a <UNK> for any trip to italy or any vacation at all because it reminds you to open yourself up to a <UNK> experience <UNK> find the magic i especially loved <UNK> lawrence as <UNK> <UNK> but every lead and supporting actor is flawless in this film further the costumes if you're drawn to fashion and costumes are extraordinarily well done i just wish they'd release it on dvd because i'm wearing my tape version out br br absolutely well worth your time just make sure to settle in to watch it without any <UNK>
<START> this movie is one for the ages first i have to say after seeing this once it became one of my all time favorite movies why simple ben <UNK> writer director has put together a true piece of art where 99 9 of movies these days are purely entertainment director ben <UNK> gives us truth gives us reality gives us a learning tool to know why this happened the mainstream media <UNK> and <UNK> but ben <UNK> looks school shootings right in the face able to go where no other form of media has ever gone before into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates while it surely is graphic and horrifying how couldn't it be the <UNK> come off the lies and the sugar <UNK> of our media masters is <UNK> aside and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened sometimes it isn't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think no sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper are more human we are shown that these boys are us and we them society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real br br respect and love your fellow man a lesson we all should learn thank you so much for making this film mr <UNK> i hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film making career
<START> <UNK> falls right into that category of films that <UNK> to make some great point while being uplifting yet falls completely flat i don't hate the film but it is missing key elements such as suspense there have been other attempts to make an engaging film about computers such as <UNK> and the net they all fall short the improbable ending of both the net and <UNK> seem to be nearly identical these movie endings suffer from one huge error in perception people in the pc business having this over indulgent self ego that assumes the general population lives it's life waiting to hear the latest news about <UNK> and <UNK> i have worked for many companies and <UNK> and they all seem to suffer from an expanded view of their own self importance as does this film br br the way they introduced plot lines was pathetic showing milo who is <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> <UNK> almost <UNK> one from a restaurant <UNK> crossed the line of stupidity only his <UNK> prevented him from sure death this makes one wonder how milo could have survived as long as he did <UNK> the <UNK> of big mac <UNK> and <UNK> seed <UNK> as they cloak themselves as well <UNK> seed <UNK> and big mac <UNK> br br <UNK> also doesn't provide much suspense the <UNK> and predictable plot twists are easily figured out long before they are revealed come on was anyone really stunned when <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was killed thereby destroying any real shock value and here again we have yet another film story where at the end the bad guys are chasing the good guys to <UNK> the <UNK> we need to have a <UNK> on this simple simon plot line for about 20 years still i pressed on maybe the ending would be the payoff but no the completely ridiculous ending where we have the head of company security another supposed evil guy turn around and be the good guy that <UNK> milo to bring down n u r v <UNK> gary winston was laughable and of course the news coverage of the arrest of gary winston is more <UNK> than when <UNK> or <UNK> was brought into custody gary winston played by tim robbins is a cardboard <UNK> of the same character robbins played in <UNK> road but that fits perfectly here in <UNK> which should be called <UNK> or <UNK> <UNK> br br in the years to come this film will likely be <UNK> to be shown only on your local third rate <UNK> channel
<START> surviving christmas 2004 ben affleck james gandolfini christina <UNK> catherine <UNK> <UNK> josh <UNK> bill macy jennifer <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> d mike mitchell dumped by his girlfriend a <UNK> <UNK> doesn't want to be left alone on christmas so he decides to return to his <UNK> home <UNK> on the dysfunctional family that now lives there and <UNK> them to pose as his family an obnoxious and one dimensional performance by affleck who mainly acts with a flashy smile makes his character come off as a mentally <UNK> creep but gandolfini and <UNK> <UNK> breathe some life into this mess even for farce its silliness is <UNK> not much makes sense from scene to scene and its sentimental messages are as phony as <UNK> grin <UNK> min rated pg 13 <UNK>
<START> first someone mentioned here that because this was released in limited <UNK> it means that it should be bad that is exactly what the big five hollywood studios would like everyone to think so they can pass or ignore features that are not <UNK> without <UNK> face or imagine by <UNK> them directly to the point this production has been released limited because is considered <UNK> by certain individuals br br now i absolutely loved this feature i find it way better then charlie <UNK> war even if it is a fictional account of something that never happens but is always so obvious this goes to anyone and everyone interested or affected by present american foreign <UNK> home or aboard the <UNK> country and the <UNK> city are definitely trying to resemble iraq and <UNK> just as much as the corporation <UNK> goes for <UNK> with the vice president dan <UNK> playing dick <UNK> lol there are quiet a moments actually where the movie is dead serious not even sarcastic anymore main example would be as how john cusack character deals with his depression but not only br br i found that all the characters can be related to something someone or specific stereotypes now word of advise if you are not politically active especially towards the aspects of <UNK> you will likely not enjoy this feature much since most of its content and inside jokes are <UNK> certain personalities that are not <UNK> to the general public on daily <UNK> main exception would be <UNK> duff that plays the well known <UNK> pop star need i say name s at its core the feature is an anti <UNK> gig period the message is <UNK> delivered with comic vengeance joan has a line at one point that goes like this and here we have a book written by you know who about how i <UNK> the world and resolved the issues with my dad priceless br br the sister and brother <UNK> play good together as always same as in <UNK> <UNK> i would say a bit more mature marisa <UNK> does not show her butt and breasts to impress us like she did recently in before the devil knows you're dead but instead she has a very serious role and manages to pull it off quiet well br br many critics don't get it can not do so or do not want to this is not a regular movie but more of a comic documentary this feature stands to deliver a message and not to get oscars or have visuals sort of getting the viewer into buying the latest <UNK> experience tv sets i have noticed even in my local papers that this movie gets bad re views because is not artistic while pro iraq war movies get good thumbs up for being balanced apparently and engaging makes one wonders how much all the world mainstream media is concentrated in the hands of a bunch of guys br br i bet this feature will prove a hit overseas as much more then it will in north america as i mentioned before it is all a satire about american foreign policy and how it has been <UNK> by special interests groups having the regular american soldier wearing the <UNK> corporate <UNK> on its combat dress is pretty insulting but effective in showing reality as it is or will be soon the way things go so far br br some priceless shots upon <UNK> the country gets <UNK> commercial <UNK> a hilarious scene about how future <UNK> will likely gather news anything is got to be better then this x box <UNK> soldiers dealing with their frustration br br overall i do not recommend this to <UNK> or hard core <UNK> of some kind or another this feature is not made to reach to the minds of souls of the people as mainstream propaganda and commercial interests always try to do so instead it contains a message well defined for <UNK> and towards some <UNK> goals apparently always short of realizing
<START> i have always said that some plays by their very nature just can't be translated to film and this one is a prime example br br as a play this is a very funny <UNK> satire of the catholic church with a razor wit and a central character who is so shockingly unreal we have to root for her even when she starts murdering her <UNK> one of whom made the fatal mistake of <UNK> he had not <UNK> since his last confession so she feels she is sending him straight to heaven br br that's just one example of how far outside of reality the play goes and in the make believe world of the theater it works however that kind of <UNK> reality rarely works on film and it certainly doesn't here br br director marshall <UNK> has assembled a fine cast who do great work but by presenting all this absurdity in a realistic fashion the comedy becomes tragedy and you are left with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach br br seek out a production of the stage play instead you won't be disappointed
<START> this is without a doubt the single worst movie ever created there's no arguing here this is it end of story the story is juvenile and sub moronic looking like it was created by a three year old fascinated with dinosaurs the entire concept is just plain dumb it's <UNK> how someone could possibly come up with something so stupid and think it was entertaining the jokes are also completely lame if you haven't seen this movie yet consider yourself lucky if your <UNK> curious as to how bad this movie is please don't make me describe it words can't express how completely awful this movie is this isn't just bad as in being a bad movie even those have <UNK> if not entertainment value this this is ugh think of the worst story ever told and <UNK> its badness level by 5 000 and you still haven't come close to how awful this movie is after giving pokemon the movie one point giving this movie one point seems like nothing short of charity that's how bad it is did the producers and directors even take film classes because this is a perfect example of how not to make a film it looks like some amateur high on paint thinner made this film if you rented this please take it back and ask for a <UNK> and don't even think about renting it again
<START> how did this become a blockbuster dear god i don't know where to start why this movie sucked too much the movie was predictable there was no originality the only thing i can admire is the acting of some characters the movie was too bright they should have done something with the lighting <UNK> making the environment more darker the make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick this is 2006 people don't get scared by other people wearing heavy make up most of the horror scenes we're taken from other hollywood or asian horror movies total rip off this is why i don't watch <UNK> movies the only reason why so many people screamed while watching this movie is because of <UNK> how many times do we have to copy scenes from the ring and <UNK> it that instead of the girl coming out of the tv its now coming from the window next door no matter how you put it its still a rip off if you want a good horror movie go watch the 50 best horror movie listed on this website
<START> this is a great movie it has a captivating story an awesome main character very good acting and killer action this takes place mostly in the year <UNK> but shows scenes that take place in past years to explain the story br br the story is very well done and there are no holes kurt russell is a <UNK> named todd who is trained from birth to kill and like all of the other soldiers have never had normal lives eventually the military introduces newer younger faster and stronger soldiers jason scott lee being one of them as a result they don't have any need for the old soldiers like todd they test out the new soldiers by having them fight some of the old soldiers in the battle russell is injured and assumed to be dead the military <UNK> his body as well as a fewer others assuming they are all dead but what they don't realize is that russell is alive br br todd finds a camp filled with civilization on this planet that the military dumped him on for a while he lives there but can't <UNK> to normal life he rarely says a word and he is at times very aggressive towards the other people when they feel he is a danger to them they send him off to the desert br br just as <UNK> leaving the planet is attacked by the new soldiers what the military forgot was to train the soldiers to be smart like todd and the other old soldiers so while these new soldiers are faster and stronger than todd todd easily <UNK> them the military starts realizing this and todd kills all of their men but one that one is jason scott lee and in the end you see a classic fight scene between russell and scott lee russell obviously comes out on top br br this is one of the best action films i've ever seen and i've seen a lot this has everything you could ask for in a film including some great lines the writer also didn't forget that russell had never seen a woman before as he calls even women sir there are no holes in this film every minute has a purpose and it's very entertaining br br an awesome one man army action film for fans of rambo <UNK> and missing in action this is highly recommended for all kurt russell fans and action sci fi fans
<START> yes it can be done john de <UNK> and <UNK> dillon <UNK> out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic horror <UNK> fi musical if there is any acting it is terrible or way over the top special effects take your pick very low budget or <UNK> every cheap cliché thought of is used no doubt a fun movie to watch worth a cold six pack or two point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a <UNK> truck and begin attacking mankind san diego is a good place as any to start scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace this cult favorite features david miller eric christmas al <UNK> tom coleman sharon taylor and john <UNK>
<START> in over 70 years of watching movies this has to be one of the very worst comedies ever made mel brooks mike meyers a few other have made some very bad comedies this however is the absolute bottom of the barrel br br it is unfunny from the very opening to the tacked on scene during the credits br br diane keaton who i normally like must have needed her paycheck badly she desperately needs to re learn her craft br br <UNK> shepard i do not know who he is needs a better director to show him how to act br br <UNK> tyler is also not up to her role br br mike white needs to find another character he has done this same type person a few times too many br br ken howard who started out years back as a first rate actor also not as good as he used to be br br there is nothing decent i can say on this attempt at movie comedy br br ratings out of 4 points 25 out of 100 imdb 1 out of 10
<START> there is an interesting discussion in this movie is being a moral person good enough or do you need something more br br the movie <UNK> that without the <UNK> of god being a morally good person is not enough there is a line early in the movie you and i can look at a person who is morally good but both know he is going to go to hell br br while i am not a christian the discussions about this throughout the course of the movie were fascinating but not in the way the movie intended i left the movie with a stronger feeling that being morally good is enough the arguments and discussions presented were heavily biased so much so that they crush themselves in the weight of their own ignorance <UNK> can be a powerful thing especially when <UNK> in the minds of the ignorant and <UNK> as george <UNK> character in dogma said hook em while they're young br br the basic premise is a very interesting one also a bible <UNK> from the <UNK> is attempting to <UNK> a book that says that morality without god is ok as long as the morality is meaningful do you only tell a child not to steal or do you tell him not to steal because god tells you not to not bothering bringing up that telling the child not to steal because well how would he feel if it was his <UNK> that were stolen br br the author <UNK> wants the recommendation of his school to help sell the book to spread the world however it needs <UNK> <UNK> and one of the <UNK> <UNK> it he brings up in a very interesting discussion early in the film about the morality for <UNK> sake vs god's words argument to prove his point he produces a time machine put in the movie solely to make the plot work which i'm fine with and sends <UNK> to the year 2002 to see where teaching morality without god will lead us br br as should be obvious he has his opinion and is changed by what he sees and has <UNK> himself by the time of his return for he does return that's not really a spoiler this is a bible movie after all br br as for the movie as a movie itself it's pretty slow and pretty poorly acted something that was not needed in this movie is that it produces two bad guys who want to try to figure out who <UNK> is even tho he hasn't hurt anyone committed a crime or anything what's wrong with the movie just showing <UNK> opinion showing his view of this <UNK> world and returning him with a new viewpoint br br also there a few points in the movie which <UNK> to me that i'm happy i'm not a christian or at least someone who says it's god or nothing three near the end of the movie rather disturbed me first when the two bad guys corner <UNK> right before he jumps <UNK> does his only truly despicable act he <UNK> like his time jump is the coming of jesus and makes it so the bad guys who are also christians btw oddly enough think they just missed the rapture br br secondly after <UNK> returns he finds a boy in which he <UNK> at the beginning of the movie about not stealing but not mentioning god kid kept the <UNK> and ran away and tells him this time that stealing is wrong because god <UNK> it like the <UNK> quote above <UNK> kids into religion is a faux <UNK> in my book br br and lastly the <UNK> another scare <UNK> <UNK> asks the <UNK> how far into the future they could go and he says he doesn't know the <UNK> shows him trying to <UNK> a bible into the distant future starts at <UNK> and it fails he keeps <UNK> the years by 10 and trying again and by the fade out he's at like <UNK> or so throughout the movie <UNK> mentions that he felt the end of the world coming because the world was <UNK> with sin and the loss of the name of god scare tactics have been in use for thousands of years you would think in these <UNK> times the church would have <UNK> as well br br i'm glad i saw this movie while i was fairly certain before that being morally good was enough now i know it for a fact worth watching if you are not a christian to <UNK> how happy you are to not be as ignorant as the folks in this movie
<START> i've seen the first of the dwarf movies and sometimes i had little fun watching it there are many famous tv <UNK> appearing in the first part and presented in fantasy costumes typical little episodes of their stand up program and exactly that is the problem the second movie has to struggle with everything was already there nothing new to obtain you're familiar with most of the often boring and dumb jokes and you always feel like their goal was to put in every <UNK> of the last decade who wants to get back on stage there's nothing important about the story typical fairy tale story of <UNK> without any importance i expected something like that but that's nothing i could complain about i'm actually complaining about the lazy story writers who had an entire background story their only business was to get many jokes and parodies inside but they didn't get it anyway this crap is except the great appearance of <UNK> schneider a total waste of time and money if you don't like him then remove 2 points of my <UNK> if you like to save your money and get bad jokes then watch the crap that's broad casted every friday evening on <UNK> or <UNK> for free i'm sure you will recognize some <UNK> i saw last night in cinema
<START> i see a lot of really negative <UNK> by people who wrote in august though the movie was not released in the us at least until the middle of september maybe these are unhappy <UNK> living in s korea who saw it early i am in the us and just saw it today i thought the special effects were excellent better than the trailer the story was non western but i think we are all used to this from many other movies it wasn't at all hard to follow the acting by the leads was weak but other people were quite good there was humor throughout too i rated it at 8 because i had a good time watching it which is what i went for
<START> i can't believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as <UNK> of course brooks has not made a comedy about real homeless people no mention of drugs prostitution or violence on these streets the people we meet in this movie are homeless in fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they don't eat quite as often <UNK> movies have become worse and worse over the years this is just another nail in the coffin
<START> cannon pulled off a real visual beauty of a medieval epic that appears fascinating except for the dragon prop now just how did the long gone studio known for chuck norris movies ever come up with a complete lack of knowledge in the first place case in point the amateurish acting and horrible plot is a sign that <UNK> the medieval legend is no cure for some lousy execution they actually went on and made another cheap <UNK> featuring hundreds of <UNK> <UNK> just to make this look even better for the two barbarian brothers they sure know how to make weird noises than becoming brave warriors so strong and bold enough to save their native land this is the single greatest waste of potential i've seen from an expensive low budget movie and worse enough to let an axe strike through the gorgeous print without mercy all of this followed an advertising campaign that sold t shirts based on the <UNK> the movie alone makes a great <UNK>
<START> the <UNK> tomb starts with a review of the events in the <UNK> hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the united states of america where the current high priest and the mummy <UNK> set out to <UNK> havoc and take revenge on those who <UNK> the tomb in the past br br while i absolutely loved the mummy with boris karloff as the mummy <UNK> and quite liked the <UNK> hand with tom tyler as <UNK> which is the direct prequel to this film i was not as taken with the <UNK> tomb br br it is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting <UNK> <UNK> jr is okay as <UNK> but doesn't really stand out and i guess that's my main criticism of this movie that nothing really stands out there's nothing really terrible here but nothing really outstanding either so the viewer is left with a rather bland <UNK> tale
<START> first i <UNK> this movie on vhs than i just had to buy it on dvd it is on of my favorite movies of all time i have read the book but i really think the movie is much better i loved gwyneth paltrow as emma and jeremy northam as mr knightley was an excellent chose he was brilliant br br it's a 10 10 movie br br
<START> reed diamond plays a man suffering from <UNK> who's been in a mental asylum for over a decade after he was found wondering the back roads with blood on his hands the doctors want to test out an experimental new drug that'll return his lost memories if it works but when the drugs give him hallucinations of a demon he chooses to escape instead while outside he befriends a young boy whose <UNK> greg <UNK> <UNK> his mother won't let her near the <UNK> in his basement acts suspicious in general br br while the general <UNK> of the film is a tad easy to identify way before it's revealed i found mr <UNK> acting to be enthralling enough to keep my attention throughout in the interest of full <UNK> i've been a huge fan of his since homicide and his brief but extremely pivotal role in the shield up through <UNK> <UNK> not a great film nor a good one but <UNK> enough although i did like it better than the previous films that i've seen from director writer michael <UNK> room 6 <UNK> 4 <UNK> br br eye candy one fleeting pair of boobs in a <UNK> br br my grade c
<START> a famous show master enters the elevator with his girlfriend suddenly she kills him and runs away while an old lady gets a heart attack the name of the female assassin is <UNK> she is still going to school and works for an vicious criminal <UNK> who is sleeping with her one day <UNK> finds out he killed her parents br br br br even the biggest anime fans will have to admit that this vicious action thriller is an disappointing gore fest <UNK> has style but it is still trash the weird plot about a teenage girl that kills people as an assassin tried to be scary and touching at the same time only causing the story to fall flat on it's face one of the highlights is an action sequence in which the good bad heroine <UNK> is falling together with a bodyguard from a building yet the dramatic structure isn't nearly as good <UNK> and the director <UNK> <UNK> weird and grotesque animation of the character's faces is awful not only that the <UNK> sequences are just simply creepy br br grade 3 10
<START> i can't believe the positive reviews of this movie i thought it was one of the worst most poorly executed and poorly acted movies i have ever seen and the plot was completely ludicrous <UNK> she starts making out with him while he's tied to the chair <UNK> <UNK> the worst part was that it wasn't even bad in a good laughable way just plain terrible i couldn't figure out why they even bothered to show it on hbo i thought belushi was ridiculously silly very unbelievable as an eccentric hit man <UNK> i could go on again i am shocked by the positive reviews the only thing that kept me watching it is that it's fascinating to see how a movie can go wrong and what makes it bad and the ending didn't disappoint in its silliness either live by the sword die by the sword ridiculous
<START> it is nice to see the likes of oliver stone brian <UNK> al pacino and even michelle <UNK> make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage it is nice to see people so rich and <UNK> wasting their time on one of the most forgettable trite and pathetic pieces of film making of all time this movie represents the worst of hollywood br br what is this is it based on a true story well they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off usa today but then the movie <UNK> to some fantasy world and a <UNK> <UNK> going to make it in the american drug <UNK> kind of like rocky on cocaine is it a movie about cuba or <UNK> for the life of me i don't believe there is a single cuban in this movie the accents are totally fake and scene with <UNK> mother looks like a poster for <UNK> american values the whole scene looks like something out of the dick van dyke show is this movie about miami it looks more like l a <UNK> in florida <UNK> a palm tree is a palm tree is this a romance novel the relationship between pacino and pfeiffer is so obvious from the <UNK> and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other is this a drug movie well no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned the behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water admittedly the acting is terrible br br let's get to the rest the music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a lawrence <UNK> show i think i heard a <UNK> the camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more <UNK> than could ever be effective clearly the photography budget was excessive the sound is <UNK> in a number of spots and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse the writing is appalling this is one of those movies were the script writes itself you are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next each pushing the plot like a sack of <UNK> br br so i am going to ask is this even a movie it could be a drama series <UNK> together for two and a half hours but at least a drama series has some kind of focus maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together whatever it is movie or not it is a piece of crap
<START> the movie was much better than the other reviewer stated it's a nice family movie it has a fun fantasy aspect of some time travel the story revolves around a 14 year old girl who accidentally finds a way to travel back in time in the old elevator of her apartment building of course no one believes her when she tries to explain her <UNK> she finds and makes friends with a girl about her age and is able to help the girl's family in many ways she is also able to help her own relationship with her father in the long run it reminds me of a hallmark movie so give it a chance and decide for yourself it seemed to be aimed more towards children about 6 12 years maybe a bit older and it's pretty much pg or g rated i'm an adult who can appreciate a nice family movie i guess the other reviewer isn't
<START> well one has to give the director credit for how <UNK> he was <UNK> would be the right term not only did he use a total cast of five people no extras at all but he also decided to use sub par special effects with a confusing and boring plot he also and i am not kidding put a warning at the beginning of the movie that you might die of fright however they do promise a <UNK> <UNK> to have a creepy <UNK> <UNK> is always a good move <UNK> unique <UNK> br br if you watch mystery science theater 3000 you <UNK> seen this they like to showcase horrible movies just to let you know br br a good gift for someone you hate
<START> i have to say that higher learning is one of the top 3 movies i have ever watched it has a brilliant cast and an equally brilliant director <UNK> shows how life in university can be there are 3 main story lines the <UNK> the african americans and the <UNK> i was intrigued by all of the stories but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about <UNK> battling her feelings towards another girl the end was great after seeing the movie 25 times plus i still cry i would have given this movie an 11 but i have to <UNK> 10 10
<START> most definitely the worst columbo ever <UNK> up no murder and the <UNK> of the tried and tested formula makes this a real drag falk looks bored throughout and so will you be if you waste anytime watching this
<START> my goodness is this movie bad i was totally <UNK> by my local movie review because this is <UNK> garbage yeah yeah good guys wear white bad guys wear black and the good guys always win now go home and hug your kids and feel how good hollywood has made you feel <UNK> i can't believe this brain dead movie was made by wes craven i'm guessing he needed a little money to pay the <UNK> so he made this piece of dung it is the sort of production that makes anyone who watches movies regularly believe they could do as good or better than such an experienced director br br ya see a bad guy wants a sweet girl who loves her daddy to do a <UNK> <UNK> bad thing or he's gonna hurt her daddy but being ms all american girl next door we know she's gonna save the day and beat the bad guys the end girl power rocks br br c'mon now only an idiot would find this entertaining a roller coaster ride let alone something fresh or new all those super <UNK> reviews you see on this site are from industry <UNK> who are either making money off this flick paying back a favor or they have sold their souls to the devil br br <UNK> mcadams is beautiful <UNK> that's it not a good performance not a horrible one she's just cute she would have had to show a whole lot of skin to save this movie she isn't tough enough to be a good female action lead br br cillian murphy was at least passable in 28 days but here he plays a dumb villain pretending to be a smart one he gets his ass kicked to and <UNK> by the <UNK> mcadams because after all she was a <UNK> and a field hockey player and i'm sure she owns all the <UNK> bo tapes so she should be able to kick the crap out of an international terrorist for hire i wouldn't trust him to steal a pack of <UNK> from 7 11 br br ya see this movie was done before except before they did it well go re rent any of the die hard movies you have loved ones in danger international terrorists except the characters are more likable and believable and the bad guys are way more competent and interesting i simply don't understand how hollywood can continue to make such crap as if they were oblivious to the proper models they can readily copy no wonder movie <UNK> are down br br throw your 6 down the toilet and save yourself 2 hours of your life you'll never get back br br <UNK> <UNK>
<START> this film sold for one dollar at wal mart on a dvd and so i do not feel like i lost anything for watching this film except my time enjoyed the acting of tom hanks <UNK> <UNK> who was very young looking and gave an outstanding performance considering it was a horrible script the story is about college students who decided to play the game <UNK> monsters only in a very realistic setting <UNK> <UNK> has had problems in the past playing this game at other <UNK> and is advised by his parents to leave the game alone and get good <UNK> <UNK> meets a very nice gal and has a romantic <UNK> with her and once he starts playing the game he stops making love to her and acts like a monk there are some scenes in the film which are taken running around the former world trade center and also in the observation floor and roof area it is rather sad viewing this part of the film where so many human beings died because of evil in the world this is not a very good film except for tom hanks trying to keep the film above the sinking level of entertainment
<START> the movie has only one flaw unfortunately this flaw <UNK> all credibility of the piece br br it starts with the <UNK> of the israeli <UNK> of <UNK> <UNK> it fails to address the reason <UNK> are there egypt <UNK> iraq and jordan attacked israel this is why israel <UNK> their land because those countries lost it in a war they started br br the film also claims that israel has <UNK> the u n by not <UNK> with resolution <UNK> problem is <UNK> was rejected immediately upon it's <UNK> by the <UNK> making it void br br many films are put together well and can really show footage that changes minds but remember when watching anything believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see br br all participants in this film are known critics of israel and some have made many <UNK> public comments <UNK> any possible credibility to their words br br all participants are in dire need of a actual history lesson taught <UNK> not by some palestinian <UNK>
<START> i loved this movie it was one of the years best <UNK> i remember watching it on <UNK> or some god damn thing but it was great i only saw like half of it and i taped it and all i can say is i loved every minute of what i saw i didnt sleep for weeks after i saw this movie although i was very tired
<START> let me count the ways br br 1 a title only <UNK> that pulls out every cliché in the slasher <UNK> br br 2 a plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic br br 3 a completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills br br 4 a pg 13 rating that <UNK> no gore violence or sex br br 5 a villain that is not frightening or even mysterious br br 6 a cast of characters that are so <UNK> written and stereotyped that we couldn't possibly care about them br br 7 a lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere much unlike the original prom night br br 8 a script of dialog that's beyond poor it's mind numbing br br 9 a series of cardboard performances not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that br br 10 a completely inept teen targeted slasher remake that's not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination or even to show a <UNK> of blood br br it's a no <UNK> horror fans save your money br br bomb out of
<START> this film's kind of like conan the <UNK> but with more sex rape and murder there is a plot somewhere underneath all this <UNK> but the filmmakers don't do a good job showing it which is a shame because it <UNK> be a decent story richard hill gives a solid performance in the lead role as does the villain who sadly didn't appear in anything else of note the fight scenes aren't too bad either i love the way deathstalker lets his sword <UNK> the blood of his victims and there's plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of <UNK> throughout br br all in all not good but not necessarily that bad either
<START> 1st watched 8 <UNK> 2009 7 out of 10 <UNK> sidney franklin well told account of <UNK> in china and their rise to <UNK> and struggles with what mother nature throws at them this movie is based on an award winning novel and chronicles a family starting with the son's arranged marriage to a slave girl the movie does a good job of keeping your interest despite a somewhat hammy performance by the lead played by paul muni it chronicles wong long the character played by muni and how he works the land buys more land eventually becomes very rich but then returns to the land where he originally started the relationship between him and his wife played by <UNK> rainer is the main thread of the story besides the land itself and despite the obvious non chinese actors it does a pretty good job of displaying the country and it's people it's obvious that mgm used it's money to create a really good epic with this one in an era where they could probably afford it the scene with the <UNK> is done exceedingly well and the rest of <UNK> movie really looks good <UNK> the best cinematography award at the oscars in that year the definitive definition of an epic is what this story is and it's pulled off pretty well
<START> one of b and c movie producer roger <UNK> greatest cult classics was the ramones vehicle originally <UNK> for cheap trick rock <UNK> roll high school it's just a simple technically dated story but would serve up extra doses of nostalgia humor considering these were the kind of things that made <UNK> dynamite characters funny see <UNK> van about teenagers who love rock <UNK> roll br br students at vince <UNK> high school are met with resistance by the evil principal miss evelyn <UNK> played by cult classic favorite mary <UNK> who fears that rock <UNK> roll turns kids into <UNK> amoral <UNK> and <UNK> to make a rock <UNK> roll free zone actually she <UNK> to wipe out rock <UNK> roll for all students regardless of whether its at school and she has the <UNK> of most of the adults who might make the plan successful br br but not if riff <UNK> <UNK> soles can help it a ramones fanatic she has written some songs including rock <UNK> roll high school that she wants to give to the ramones and in trying to do so is <UNK> by miss <UNK> who does all she can to keep her from going to see the ramones play in town it <UNK> into an ultimate revolt between the <UNK> fun hating adults and the teenagers in an ending that is reminiscent of over the edge somewhat after the years of punk when the fame of garage <UNK> the ramones and others would mark another shift in music evolution it was great to see a movie that celebrated the fun of it all and in such a humorous exaggerated way br br it is mostly mild comedy but a great feel good comedy nonetheless when you're in the mood for something more laid back to entertain you with jerry <UNK> of airplane fame and joe <UNK> of <UNK> fame both taking part in some of the directing you can get the idea for what kind of humor you're in for and not to mention expect to see dick miller even if only for a few minutes in the film's finale the story must've later inspired and was consequently updated by the mid 90s comedy detroit rock city which some minor character changes in the vehicle for aged <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> br br i would recommend passing on the corey <UNK> vehicle rock <UNK> roll high school forever released nearly a decade later the original is still the best
<START> first of all i just want to say that i love this show but this episode this episode makes a mockery of the entire show br br i don't know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire series br br there is no story line everything is chaotic and the jokes are crap br br the way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game for example how do the <UNK> look like by creating that stupid previously on is simply embarrassing br br its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad
<START> kalifornia is a great film that makes us look at ourselves the film has a great cast brad pitt johnny <UNK> a river runs through it and the legends of the fall as early <UNK> david duchovny the x files as brian <UNK> michelle forbes star trek the next generation homicide life on the street and escape from l a as carrie <UNK> <UNK> girlfriend and juliette lewis natural born killers cape fear and what's eating gilbert <UNK> as adele <UNK> <UNK> girlfriend br br brian <UNK> is a writer who is a liberal is getting ready to write a book about serial killers brian and his girlfriend carrie decide they want to move to california so brian places an ad at the college for some who wants to go to california to share <UNK> on the trip br br early <UNK> is an ex con and <UNK> on <UNK> who recently lost his job at the mirror factory in town is in debt owes his <UNK> money <UNK> <UNK> officer stops to visit him and tells him about a job early goes to the college and sees the ad he later tells adele his girlfriend about leaving to go to california early and adele meet brian and carrie at the bus stop and leave town brian and carrie do not know that he is a killer who just killed his <UNK> for a little while brian and carrie thought of early and adele different but got to know them and become sort of friends carrie and adele become real good friends br br their journey is a very learning one though brain and carrie not knowing early is a killer till later on in the movie the question brian asks in this film about the difference between killers and us is a very good question early <UNK> is a <UNK> who doesn't see the error of his ways goes down hill later on and pays the price br br this film is a great movie i give it 10 10 stars and 2 thumbs up i love the songs in the movie especially at the end of the film the song look up to the sky by the indians
<START> what a terrible terrible film one of the worst movies i have seen in my life i usually love movies like this the whole a guy meets an eccentric woman who he likes but he happens to already be involved with someone who not right for him i expected something predictable and i didn't mind the movies are always entertaining mixing the right amount of romance with comedy but not this one every single joke falls flat and the romance makes me want to vomit the title character is one of the most please kill me characters that i have ever witnessed on my television the eccentric woman isn't very eccentric more like quirky and annoying the other someone is the most reasonable mature person in this film but also happens to be just as annoying this films flat out sucks there's no way around it don't waste your time
<START> this early role for barbara shelley in fact her first in britain after working in italy was made when she was 24 years old and it's certainly safe to say that she made a stunning debut in <UNK> cat girl while <UNK> and <UNK> get most of the attention i'll always <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> the lovely <UNK> haired actress with the deep voice always <UNK> intelligence as well as vulnerability one such example being 1960's village of the damned in which her screen time was much less than her character's husband george sanders she is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of cat people and is seen to great advantage throughout it's difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase her character apparently sleeps in the nude and we are exposed to her <UNK> bare back when she is <UNK> also exposed 8 years later in <UNK> <UNK> the mad monk the ravishing <UNK> she wears during most of the film is a stunning <UNK> wonder i don't see what held that dress up but i'd sure like to all in all proof positive that barbara shelley in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable a real test of star power which she would find soon enough at <UNK> studios in <UNK> for the duration of the 1960's
<START> <UNK> are going to have to do a lot better than this little <UNK> of a film if they're going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves br br this film is set in <UNK> although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a scottish accent the premise about people who's lives are going nowhere who all meet up in the same <UNK> in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs could have made for a really funny insightful quirky <UNK> film instead we have a group of self obsessed <UNK> and a plot which has been so done to bits i'm <UNK> it hasn't been banned x and y are friends x is sleeping with z y sleeps with z as well oh you figure it out br br a total waste of time painful dialogue it sounded like something that a group of 16 year olds would have written for a <UNK> drama project the female character was completely superfluous just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be <UNK> into seeing it br br if you're the sort of <UNK> <UNK> who laughs at beer <UNK> and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on saturday nights in <UNK> town <UNK> then you will love this film and find it a right <UNK> everyone else run don't walk away from this sorry little <UNK> br br and one question when the group left the boring <UNK> town <UNK> incidentally although they changed the name on the film to go back to <UNK> why did they do it via the <UNK> <UNK> services at <UNK> which is in england
<START> i first saw this movie as a pre teen about the age when kids start to think through their identity i was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children who he raises as his own the <UNK> boy has been <UNK> that his mother is a prostitute and none of his siblings have the same <UNK> father which kurosawa makes obvious by having children who look nothing like each other the man still <UNK> tho boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts the man is acclaimed to be father by all of the children but one who still prefers her brother br br each of the vignettes are likewise compelling for their own stories and conclusions br br it's a great film even if it is not the greatest kurosawa film
<START> one of the other <UNK> mentioned that they almost walked out if i hadn't been with my wife who wanted to stay i would have left it's a shame too because i think it could have been a good movie but this is easily one of the worst adapted screenplays i've ever seen it starts out nowhere and it goes nowhere i would say it goes nowhere fast but it really goes nowhere slow painfully slow from time to time there are hints that something interesting might happen or that there is potentially some depth underneath one of the characters but that's all we get hints there is not a single payoff or revelation in the entire movie not that i need a slick plot to be entertained i love a good meandering character study as much as the next indie buff but these characters add up to nothing for the entire duration of the film you don't care what happens to a single one of them as a matter of fact you almost start hoping they die because at least a death might be more interesting than watching their inexplicable behavior which is so strange and unpredictable that you'd think it in itself would be compelling but it's not instead of quirky noir esquire characters acting in hard boiled fashion you simply recognize it immediately for what it is a bunch of talented but miscast actors brooding and raising their <UNK> while reading bizarre dialogue without a hint of relevant context all this for two plodding painfully slow hours awful
<START> this movie was worth five punches on my <UNK> card i saw this while <UNK> in virginia in the mid <UNK> i saw it alone so i was not distracted while i watched it it sucked it was the most ridiculous total waste of celluloid i've ever seen br br i know that others who have reviewed this movie have thought that it was awesome i offer you this if it was so awesome what was it's box office take end of discussion
<START> after seeing the previews i felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast furious series so i already expected it to have a lacking storyline but at least this time it won't be loaded with a bunch of <UNK> <UNK> with fart <UNK> unfortunately i was wrong if you could only imagine a fast furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you br br this is the absolute worst movie i had ever seen i'm being nice no i would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said not only was the storyline non existent but the action was crap too i guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie for an example there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the <UNK> button and his <UNK> takes off in the air and flies over a <UNK> <UNK> to win and after the bit where eddy <UNK> got in a fight with one of his girls an <UNK> comment would work in this case the girl asks to pull over and get out of the plane and of course they do in the middle of the desert after this wonderful scene i couldn't take it anymore so i only got to see half of this monstrosity this is the first movie i had ever walked out on afterwards i had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my <UNK> brain cells br br i gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option you're better off going to the local car show and stopping at a strip joint on the way home i will keep all viewers in my <UNK>
<START> as a writer i find films this bad making it into production a complete slap in the face talk about insulting i was writing better stories than this in <UNK> grade bad acting bad writing bad directing and when added all together the result is complete and total failure br br the only thing this movie manages to accomplish is <UNK> the unsuspecting <UNK> into wasting their time who would green light something so poorly written it's not artistic clever smart suspenseful mysterious scary dramatic nothing br br the characters are flat and boring with no development the plot is as recycled as an <UNK> can they somehow managed to cast a few very familiar actors who all must be pretty desperate for work or hoping one of these low budget independent movies will turn out to be the next pulp fiction this script should have been used to line a bird cage not a movie br br oh and last but not least a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> woman of course has the strength to kill men and women twice her size without a struggle and in a single blow br br avoid this bomb like it will <UNK> you with an <UNK>
<START> spoilers <UNK> this is an absolutely awful film first of all it has that guy from medium i guess he's made a career out of playing super <UNK> <UNK> it was ok the first time he tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monster but then 10 minutes later they <UNK> did it again and so it goes this film moves in excruciating real time at one point i started <UNK> it was days later until i was reminded that the story line was only at the next day in the early afternoon still i'm not really sure who this couple is supposed to be in real life first of all they are presented as sort of a manhattan <UNK> couple who grew up and had a kid but they drive an old blue <UNK> those types stopped driving <UNK> decades ago today they drive <UNK> but in 2002 i'm sure they still weren't driving <UNK> br br ok then there's wendigo a mysterious indian man gives the boy a little magic wendigo statue and tells him of its powerful magic c'mon are we still doing ancient indian mysteries just to drive it home they pan across every indian statue in their tourist trap <UNK> new york town american indians are portrayed in a manner not seen for decades in this film oh and about wendigo he is not actually the cause of the horror he doesn't kill the kid's dad which is the most horrible thing in the film he's just killed by an ordinary <UNK> with a grudge and a high powered rifle the wendigo only comes out late in the film to avenge the guy who killed the dad oh but wait it seemed earlier that wendigo was kind of mad at the dad maybe because he killed a deer so then wendigo must have been happy that the dad was killed but br br and so it goes insulting boring and nonsensical there is no reason to watch this film at all
<START> this may be a bit on the <UNK> side i would like to start by saying i did not watch the entire movie nor could i because it was evident from the first hour that i was going to be incredibly disappointed that of course is the problem with taking what many believe to be an amazing book and turning it into a disney made for tv movie br br a <UNK> in time should have been made into an amazing movie a long time ago it's got a great storyline that could hook children and adults plus it's got built in quality sequels but disney <UNK> was not the way to go the problem with the movie is that all the things they changed to turn it into a visual story <UNK> down what was so great about the book it is a complicated and emotional story for kids there was no reason to make charles wallace purely psychic because that was the <UNK> way of explaining it there was no reason to write a fight between the three mrs <UNK> as added tension there is enough tension in the story without that there was no reason to remove <UNK> glasses that <UNK> us of what could've been a very sweet scene between <UNK> and meg that happens in the book br br i could <UNK> for days about little things but i also think larger things like the art direction was a off take for instance the way they made <UNK> look with its strangely <UNK> <UNK> the creepiness that comes across in the book is that <UNK> could be earth it looks like earth it has people on it that look like humans the <UNK> are blue the grass is green and there are children playing but something is a little bit off the directors chose to make <UNK> a complete other instead of taking the lesson in the book and <UNK> it to the overall direction of the movie the lesson of course is that <UNK> could very well be earth that is if we forget how to love it would've been much <UNK> to have a beautiful afternoon as they're walking down the street with the kids <UNK> the balls in the same rhythm br br i unfortunately did not watch the end maybe someone can tell me how disney messed up the end as well br br overall an artistic disappointment br br
<START> why <UNK> why did i pick this one up well i needed a no <UNK> in the summer heat and the cover looked cool br br of course i should've known better this is a really really bad movie and it gets <UNK> when the makers know it's bad and try cover it up by adding some sexy beautiful women and some sex scenes to it well folks it <UNK> cut it does it br br if you would like a cool movie about a big <UNK> that is actually very very good well played and funny go rent lake <UNK> that is an order
<START> <UNK> from its original japanese name of laputa for being an offensive phrase something which director <UNK> miyazaki was oblivious to at the time castle in the sky is the master <UNK> third film and it's one of his most beloved of all time initially a box office disappointment in its 1986 release it has since been <UNK> by critics and audiences around the world inspired by jonathan <UNK> <UNK> travels castle in the sky is a <UNK> themed action adventure tale about two young <UNK> young <UNK> <UNK> and mysterious girl <UNK> who wears a magic crystal around her neck who team up to find the long lost island of laputa which is <UNK> to have great <UNK> and gems they are aided by a band of bumbling yet sympathetic air pirates led by the <UNK> <UNK> who at first chase them yet turn out to be true allies and pursued by the government headed by its villainous <UNK> secret agent <UNK> who wants the power of laputa for his own benefit br br for anyone looking for an exciting way to spend two hours this film is an excellent choice featuring just the right amount of humor exploration wonder and mystery to keep one interested the artwork although not as spectacular as in some of miyazaki's later movies is fantastic and gorgeous enough to watch with imaginative characters and locations incredibly exciting action scenes and breathtaking flight sequences that will make one feel <UNK> and while the characters that <UNK> this tale are less complex than miyazaki's other works each has a memorable endearing personality that stays with the viewer long after the film is over <UNK> in particular makes for a terrific comic character shouting orders to her <UNK> sons one moment and being protective of <UNK> the next <UNK> is one of the few miyazaki creations to ever come across as an <UNK> villain but like <UNK> he <UNK> every scene he's in with a sinister charisma that is both <UNK> and <UNK> br br anime fans have often compared this movie to <UNK> sci fi adventure series <UNK> the secret of blue water after all both works share similar story and character elements not to mention that they were both created by miyazaki himself where both <UNK> is in their execution <UNK> although charming for the most part suffered from taking a wrong turn at its <UNK> point <UNK> into cartoonish nonsense which all but distracted from the main plot even though it did have a strong ending castle in the sky on the other hand remains consistently entertaining and focused for its two hour running time and is all the better for it while the film's epic tone is sometimes broken up by some cartoonish moments like a <UNK> between <UNK> boss and one of <UNK> sons it's never to the point that it <UNK> from the film br br about eleven years ago disney released an english version featuring a cast of big names such as james van der <UNK> anna <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> mark <UNK> mandy <UNK> as well as some cameo appearances by veterans such as <UNK> <UNK> and jim <UNK> it also features an ambitious <UNK> of joe <UNK> gorgeous musical score for a performance by the seattle music orchestra interestingly the man behind this <UNK> is none other than the composer himself as much as <UNK> have cried <UNK> over this version for its occasional extra dialogue and the aforementioned <UNK> miyazaki had no such problems in fact he is said to have <UNK> the <UNK> and for good reason because the newly <UNK> music is truly the star of the new dub while there are some instances where filling in some <UNK> silent scenes from the original japanese is a bit jarring notably the journey through a dragon <UNK> storm cloud the overall <UNK> is fantastic and in many ways <UNK> on the original particularly in scenes such as when a robot attacks a <UNK> and the climactic moments toward the end here <UNK> displays his musical <UNK> and genius for matching music to visuals br br as far as the performances in the dub go the leads are probably at the short end of the stick james van der <UNK> <UNK> sounds significantly more mature than his character while anna <UNK> <UNK> speaks with an odd accent that <UNK> at times a problem which actually works in favor of the character that said both do good jobs overall and provide a fairly believable chemistry throughout it's the lively supporting cast however that really make this dub so much fun particularly <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and mark <UNK> <UNK> both are perfectly cast and steal every scene they're in as with the <UNK> these two really warrant a listen to the disney dub the script adaptation borders on the loose side at times there's quite a bit of extra lines and or commentary some of which are <UNK> funny and others somewhat overdone but aside from at least one <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> speech in the climactic showdown the world cannot live without love as opposed to the original you can't survive apart from mother earth the overall characters story and spirit remain fairly faithful to the original on the whole there is little point comparing the disney version to the original language track each puts their own <UNK> on this legendary masterpiece and i like them both they're also better than <UNK> <UNK> more literal but <UNK> robotic lifeless <UNK> acted and poorly written older dub from the late 1980's don't believe anybody who says this version is superior to <UNK> trust me the opposite is true br br either way though you can't go wrong with castle in the sky it's one of miyazaki's all time greatest and i highly recommend it
<START> <UNK> is a great film the four young actresses jodie foster <UNK> <UNK> marilyn <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are wonderful the song on the radio by donna summer is lovely a great film
<START> in the fan robert de niro plays <UNK> <UNK> or is it travis <UNK> or rupert <UNK> or max <UNK> you see the problem with this type of role is that de niro has played very very similar characters in taxi driver the king of comedy and cape fear and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts i found it slightly difficult to believe that <UNK> would have started out as a frustrated obsessive sports fan into being an out and out psycho br br the character arc isn't the only problem with this script it also lacks a character focus a problem i had with the <UNK> where de niro should have been superb but ended up slightly flat for several stretches of the movie i kept thinking that bobby <UNK> was the main character then the story switches back to <UNK> it also seems to have disappointed a lot of sports fans who seem to think this should have concentrated a bit more on baseball i'm not sure if this was meant to appeal to baseball fans originally but again there are elements which hint it might have if the producers had made up their minds has to who and what the story should focus upon br br i will admit i was entertained by the fan especially by the soundtrack but it is a very flawed film and it should be remembered that by the mid 1990s characters being stalked by <UNK> as in single white female <UNK> entry etc had run out of steam a long time ago
<START> along with <UNK> duck this is unfairly cancelled disney has been in decline since tarzan and we need a show like this to get disney back on track ed gilbert and jim <UNK> were perfect for the voices of louis and <UNK> sounds familiar the theme theme tune is also catchy out of all the villains which are all great on their own merits tony jay stands out as <UNK> <UNK> louis and <UNK> actually sound very similar to the voice overs in the jungle book which isn't a bad thing at all as a matter of fact it's quite inspirational the animation was spot on and the script had plenty of wit that has been severely lacking in animations for years please bring this show back 9 10 <UNK> cox
<START> for anyone that loves predictable movies with an awful soundtrack lack of dialogue clichés up the <UNK> and also stereotypes that just happens to be typical of an american film look no <UNK> <UNK> whether wanted to save money on <UNK> voice talent or really wanted to create an animated episode of national <UNK> either way they succeeded in delivering a rather bland and boring movie spirit <UNK> of the <UNK> is a bore fest that sends mixed <UNK> to kids and adults and also fails to entertain despite the oh so <UNK> theme of animals <UNK> over humans after looking past the wonderful animations what you have remaining is nothing but a big mess br br spirit is about a <UNK> that from the beginning of the film looks like quite a handful as he is a horse that cannot be <UNK> <UNK> nor controlled because of this he rises and becomes the leader of his group of high spirited horses which includes his mom but his life of freedom and running around comes to an abrupt halt as he is captured by a group of americans in the process of connecting the wild west with the rest of the country during this spirit never actually named that throughout the entire film almost befriends a courageous native american and a fellow female horse and also has a lot of run ins with the cynical and cruel army folks that apparently don't believe in giving up br br why must movies mix computer animation with traditional it comes off looking rather <UNK> something spirited away suffered from as well best example is when a train is chasing after spirit you see the hand drawn spirit running from a computer animated train it would look much better if it were one or the other but not both unless you can really pull off some nice effects beauty and the <UNK> famous dance sequence uses computer animation but it is nowhere near as obvious as the train or the snow in this movie the opening sequence was the best looking part of the film kind of sad to see the rest of the movie slide a bit downhill in terms of quality a little scene has multiple i mean multiple similar shots of just a <UNK> face quite repetitive and annoying in my opinion br br the kids might enjoy this flick but with lack of dialog song and motivation it might be a perfect technique in making hyper children fall asleep while disney becomes criticized for its animated musicals they wind up becoming much more entertaining than a more realistic approach to telling a story like this one bryan adams has no place in this movie and why does hans <UNK> stay away from using a western theme in this movie when it is a story taking place in the old west soundtrack sounds a bit off if you ask me at least they are using realistic noises of horses two points for that yet if you are going to <UNK> from making horses talk why even have a narrator <UNK> every so often which just so happens to be the main character himself br br native americans are nice and the western folks are evil native killing horse torturing <UNK> <UNK> monsters that must be destroyed more or less this is what spirit is showing us it reaches a point in which they are trying so hard for the viewers to hate the <UNK> of the wild west they even had a scene of several horses pulling a huge train up a hill and another scene of them destroying an entire village of natives now the person spirit <UNK> happened to <UNK> him on more than one occasion yet that is forgivable apparently because he is not a soldier that or because he has the sassy female horse br br spirit isn't exactly a victim we should feel sorry for the viewer is supposed to sympathize with spirit despite him putting his entire group of horses at risk <UNK> havoc and even perhaps resulting in some off screen deaths that are quickly shoved aside because oh no spirit is in trouble this film gets quite <UNK> as we see in multiple instances spirit escaping from chains kicking people around destroying property <UNK> horses and then getting captured again all in this same order too the writers also seem to have an obsession with <UNK> because they are <UNK> all over the movie for an old west film they certainly have very little room to <UNK> br br bottom line this is most certainly no disney movie as a matter of fact that is a bad thing even though it was what they were aiming for so instead of the typical musical we get a boring film that becomes predictable dull and slow in multiple instances even the decent animation becomes inconsistent when the computer work gets thrown in everything about this movie was just wrong from the ideals that back then americans that were not native were evil <UNK> to the soundtrack and musical score that just seemed so far off kill bill <UNK> 2 which pretty much has nothing to do with the old west has more of a western feel than this movie do yourselves a favor and totally skip this by all means necessary thank you
<START> i have copy of this on vhs i think they the television networks should play this every year for the next twenty years so that we don't forget what was and that we remember not to do the same mistakes again like putting some people in the director's chair where they don't belong this movie <UNK> is like a <UNK> musical for those who can't sing or act this movie is as much fun as trying to teach the <UNK> to drive a city bus br br john hood <UNK> has just got out of prison and he's headed back to the old neighborhood in serving time for an all to nice crime of necessity of course john heads back onto the old street and is <UNK> by kids dogs old ladies and his <UNK> <UNK> as they dance and sing all along the way br br i would recommend this if i was sentimental or if in truth someone was smoking <UNK> pot <UNK> by a doctor for <UNK> either way this is a poorly directed scripted acted and even produced i never thought i'd sat that satire of ghetto life with the <UNK> although i think the redeeming part of the story through the wannabe gang fight sequences and the dance numbers his friends care about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from being torn down and <UNK> up br br forget sonny <UNK> mario could have won an oscar for that in comparison to this rap oh well if you find yourself wanting to laugh yourself silly and three quarters embarrassed be sure to drink first br br and please watch <UNK> no stars better luck next time
<START> i saw this movie in my childhood and after 10 years i did not remember anything about this movie but i found out it i also don't know how i was able to find out this movie its my life my all times favorite movie my words will fall short of true meaning what i have inside for this movie i follow this movie it's a brilliant mix of fantasy comedy romance horror erotic scary and martial arts the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm it's a masterpiece of hong kong cinema br br <UNK> <UNK> is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film written by <UNK> <UNK> and directed by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a chinese ghost story has it all <UNK> <UNK> sin played by leslie cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for <UNK> deep in the woods a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near the trek alone is <UNK> with wolves and a crazy <UNK> monk lives at the temple br br <UNK> <UNK> sin meets <UNK> a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple she is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress but when she meets innocent <UNK> <UNK> sin they fall in love br br <UNK> <UNK> sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place while <UNK> tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods there's great martial arts even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual <UNK> sword forms the movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films <UNK> with magic and flying through the air <UNK> from tree to tree with elegant long <UNK> and <UNK> but the movie genuinely flows and everything is effective br br <UNK> is to be married to a evil tree monster which cant be good and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice br br in the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue and go with <UNK> deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls and bring <UNK> <UNK> back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation br br a beautiful story that truly pays attention to details one is touched in many ways by this movie you'll laugh cry and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography and though at the end <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting <UNK> we never know if <UNK> was <UNK> a reincarnation but we do know her
<START> overlong drama that isn't capable of making any real point so she became an actress so what she learned to love big deal there is a certain <UNK> among the characters and in the dialog and situations but the kind which is bad for the movie causing it to often seem absurd br br summer phoenix playing the lead talks and behaves like a semi retarded person so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater which was clearly not the intended point we are told early on in that barry <UNK> like narration that she learned to hide her emotions which certainly explains her <UNK> stone face but the movie suffers for it she basically walks around like a zombie and her success as an actress isn't quite credible given her lack of emotions occasionally the movie had that dull sleepy feel of a dogma 95 movie is it one i wouldn't be at all surprised br br summer phoenix is sister of <UNK> phoenix and the late river phoenix <UNK> rarely works br br if you'd like to see my hollywood <UNK> list with over <UNK> pictures entries contact me by e mail
<START> this is a very grim hard hitting even brutal film about a death row break that goes awry it's black and white photography keeps it from being dated mickey rooney is excellent as the twisted yet strangely sympathetic lead one of the first movies to portray the psychological <UNK> of death row it is also quite poignant
<START> this documentary is incredibly thought provoking bringing you in to the lives of two long time lovers who are in the final stages of aids the past footage of their twenty some odd years together really brings their final moments home br br if this movie doesn't make you feel the pain and agony of these two fascinating people you don't have a heart
<START> as i am from <UNK> i have heard many people saying better and better things about <UNK> so far but actually i don't understand the reason of all the fuss br br i liked many points of the movie some of the quotes really <UNK> me up but the stereotyped characters are present again like in every hungarian film and the story is also pretty dull i liked the first half but then i started to get bored and then i found the whole film just boring br br <UNK> <UNK> is good as always <UNK> is brilliant also but the others are just there doing nothing br br how many years still have to pass for a good hungarian film
<START> a very <UNK> series i had not seen an exact combination among drama action suspense and sci fi never before i am impressed every chapter the screenplay is very intelligent i don't know how the creators <UNK> all this amazing stories every character have a strange past troubles <UNK> relationships it gives to the show the human sense needed for creating intimate characters br br the most incredible is the fact that all the characters are related among them the numbers they have met before without knowing it and so on the others enigmatic security system and the <UNK> <UNK> are elements that don't let us lose a chapter br br mr <UNK> <UNK> what did you think to create this amazing story
<START> this documentary is a <UNK> of the last few years of betty <UNK> <UNK> richards career the <UNK> <UNK> was the most recognizable pin up queen in history her most memorable work came in the 1950's and was fetish photos bondage and cat fight <UNK> flicks irving <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> at his movie star news <UNK> betty on what to do in front of the camera there was no nudity in the famous photos or <UNK> films but nonetheless <UNK> was charged with <UNK> obscene <UNK> and was ordered to destroy them to avoid <UNK> it is no surprise that betty had a cult following at the height of her career the girl next door with jet black hair blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would <UNK> for decades after all it has been said that she was photographed more than marilyn monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world elvis <UNK> betty page would disappear and <UNK> her last years to religion this movie actually could have been a lot better but good enough to hold interest br br miss richards is stunning in her own right <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> belt and <UNK> do not hurt her image in the least also in the cast <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> strain emily marilyn and julie <UNK> be advised this movie can change your heart rate
<START> unless you are an <UNK> christian then make like an egyptian and avoid like the biblical plague br br awful why oh why does imdb list the most <UNK> reviews at the top of the list it was due to one of these that i have just wasted the end of what started out as good evening on this <UNK> br br the plot premise started out strong enough i was drawn into the film and was interested right up to the point where the bible <UNK> took over what a waste br br this film has so <UNK> me that i have <UNK> with imdb for the first time just to complain about it i hope at least that by doing so i save someone else's evening br br <UNK> what a christian act on my part
<START> they sell it as a horror movie it's supposed to be a thriller but i found it pretty funny comedy don't think so i laughed the whole movie i think it was because of the ridiculous acting and plot i don't blame the actors i think they were not very good but o k i think cillian is a very good bad guy i loved his acting in batman <UNK> and rachel mcadams <UNK> she's a beauty and a good actress as well but let's try to be a little objective here the story <UNK> <UNK> the direction <UNK> <UNK> it lacks a lot of good suspense in fact is a really boring movie but there's one good thing tho it's a short movie only 1 hour and 30 minutes for me it was like 10 minutes under the water br br i just don't know why this movie is rated so high and in rotten tomatoes even higher what's wrong with good rational and objective criticism
<START> average viewers looking for any sense of internal <UNK> in a film should probably give this one a pass it <UNK> the same feeling as staring at a curious array of individual images that seem to have some relationship one to another but never <UNK> into a <UNK> br br while this <UNK> approach to creating a kind of cinematic montage may appeal to a few students or critics <UNK> in the inside language of contemporary filmmaking it is <UNK> irritating and condescending to us <UNK> who just fell off the <UNK> an overt <UNK> of <UNK> may be the intentional hallmark of <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK> wong and tarantino but to me it comes across as andy <UNK> <UNK> over the only redeeming characteristic i find is in the production values and them there just ain't going to cut it all by <UNK> br br this is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait <UNK> and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes sorry the <UNK> credits unexpectedly begin to roll just as your interest begins to stir i get the same big yawn and let down reading what i guess are very <UNK> and <UNK> comments about this film that never lead to anything truly <UNK> ideas and images without some <UNK> context are not my idea of fun br br call me a <UNK> <UNK> the streets of hong kong looking for a bowl of chop <UNK> br br
<START> a few summer space <UNK> actually were <UNK> sent into space by a robot and the <UNK> in ship was running short they had to sent someone to a space station to get the gas tanks etc etc br br first of all this movie's plot is not possible in real life but it gives a warm feelings of anything is possible if you set your heart in br br it is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years i saw this movie for the first time in the year of 2000 it was filmed in 1986 there are quite a few people in that movie who are still working in hollywood br br the view was great from outer space it does not look unreal it is about 2 hours long it runs so fast that you won't even notice you know that it is not real but you just get sucked into it until the end br br overall it is a good family movie br br
<START> <UNK> has its moments but they are few and far between br br essentially this is a grade b blend of pop <UNK> thriller ghost story and horror drew barrymore plays a young woman who is haunted by the demons of her past most of her family has been murdered and she was in at least one case the prime suspect or does she just have a really bad case of multiple personality disorder george <UNK> is her new room mate and most of the action centers on him br br <UNK> character is pretty sympathetic and both he and barrymore do decent work though not exactly good the mediocre to at times totally horrendous script and the unimpressive directing seem to have combined to sink the rest of the performances into oblivion leslie <UNK> character is memorable but so irritating that you will want to forget her br br the plot eventually <UNK> into a <UNK> one story arc is psychological realism the other is supernatural horror outlandish climax which is so badly conceived acted and photographed that it effectively <UNK> most of what value the film had achieved previously br br overall the film has the feel of what might expect to be the result of m knight <UNK> first <UNK> film class the acting and script for the two leads are just good enough to make you care a little about them at least until the film <UNK> utterly and completely br br my recommendation send your <UNK> but avoid a first person encounter
<START> what can you say about the film white fire amazing fantastic disturbing hilarious these words are not big enough to describe the event which is white fire from <UNK> <UNK> beginning to profound end this movie will entertain throughout br br our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world a family is hiding from <UNK> soldiers in costume shop uniforms when the father <UNK> from the mother and their <UNK> you get a real sense of what kind of movie you're about to watch father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit and is polite as he gets people's attention before he shoots them but alas dad is burned alive in what looks like a very <UNK> <UNK> stunt meanwhile mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier <UNK> about 5 feet behind them he too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre halt and then promptly wastes the mother this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and <UNK> br br so now we fast forward about 20 years 30 if you're honest about the hero's age to beautiful turkey where bo and <UNK> have settled as professional thieves or diamond <UNK> or something <UNK> works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods while bo masterfully played by the dynamic robert <UNK> drives around the desert in his <UNK> outfits bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship they don't seem to have any friends other than each other and they spend all of their time together that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as <UNK> in lines such as you know its a shame you're my sister he says to her while she's stark naked make for a very dynamic duo bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed as he wanders the <UNK> of turkey with his <UNK> pink grief <UNK> a <UNK> of hope occurs when bo finds a girl who looks like ingrid and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong bo is a real fan of <UNK> grey areas and he is <UNK> with his new love br br so anyway there's a lot of fun action scenes ridiculous violence great acting impossible to follow plot lines fred the hammer <UNK> for some reason and a big <UNK> of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond which later explodes all of these things are great but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special really special so i <UNK> encourage everyone to behold the <UNK> that is white fire you may be glad you did or not
<START> what exactly was going on during world war 11 in new zealand when american forces were there br br this awful story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to view can you imagine casting joan fontaine as the older sister to sandra dee fontaine looked more like her mother even funnier was that fontaine becomes pregnant in the film br br <UNK> laurie and paul newman who showed such great on screen chemistry 4 years later in the hustler have no scenes together in this film laurie plays another sister who goes off to <UNK> to tramp around there despite the fact that she is married <UNK> to her when her husband comes back from the war br br jean simmons is widowed and finds romance with a much subdued paul newman there is even romance for the young miss dee here br br the picture has little to no meaning are they trying to say that all is fair in love and war if they are they did a poor job in selling this br br the conflict of interest with newman and simmons is quickly <UNK> of that is what should have been quickly done to this terribly disappointing film of 1957
<START> this was among the stupidest and <UNK> of the anti <UNK> films out of the 1980s br br the idea that a kid and a basketball star could change the world is pretty far fetched given how many children's peace <UNK> and celebrity <UNK> there were and are br br but the idea that the soviet union would agree to a total nuclear <UNK> because some <UNK> kids learned of a silent protest in the west is ludicrous br br what ended the cold war america's tough dare i say <UNK> stance and the internal failures of <UNK> it was not the peace <UNK> the die ins or films like amazing grace chuck miracle mile or testament
<START> well executed old and very dark house horror good set up which includes the character of poe himself <UNK> to the story in a london pub although from here it is pretty much the one guy who has taken the dare to visit the house on a particular night running from room to room either looking for or avoiding people it is still most enjoyable plus we have the delightful and enigmatic barbara steele there is some wooden dialogue and some unexplained bits and <UNK> but it is the super creepy atmosphere that is <UNK> throughout that and the super musical score that keep this one moving nicely along dvd <UNK> from us and has a few extras
<START> i will never forget when i saw this title in the video store way back when i was always a big weird al fan and when i saw this video i rented and watched it i was too young to appreciate all of <UNK> subtle humor and satire at the time but i remember it much later when i was old enough to understand what i was watching if you are an al fan especially of his earlier work you will thoroughly enjoy this film it is done in the mtv <UNK> <UNK> style and tells a true but sometimes exaggerated tale of how al got to be where he was in 1985 you will love it if you like his brand of humor and more importantly his music
<START> the acting is pretty cheesy but for the people in this area up in the 80s and are now detroit area <UNK> <UNK> this is a great movie i even work with a japanese <UNK> so that makes this movie even more funny br br jay leno was showing his age last night on the tonight show he looks pretty young here 17 years ago the opening scene with the drag race on what appears to be <UNK> <UNK> was great br br leno also owns some bad a cars now it would e great to see a remake of this with his modern collection i'm sure the blown <UNK> in the opening scene was his own car br br typical 80s movie watch it and enjoy no computer generated crap
<START> interesting to read comments by viewers regarding <UNK> code many of the <UNK> positive comments were lifted almost word for word from <UNK> <UNK> the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video to be <UNK> besides the three part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the 70s dont remember it you wont remember this one either in a year or two this is the first movie i have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls very shameful this just goes to show that if you are a <UNK> son you too can play high roller hollywood producer with <UNK> <UNK> ladies <UNK> money
<START> standard rise to fame tale that has a few high points number one <UNK> <UNK> as sister who gives a stunning star making performance the fact that she never became a huge sensation after this is beyond me sadly she is a supporting character and we are forced to focus on <UNK> <UNK> bland character <UNK> whose rise to fame is easy boring and unconvincing however whenever the girls go on stage and perform the movie comes back to life the original music by <UNK> <UNK> must be praised the copy i saw was a very old vhs tape the picture quality was pretty low as well as the production values i'm guessing all in all its worth a <UNK>
<START> for those looking for a sequel for the fine south african miniseries of the 1980s this isn't it nor is it a historical drama rather it is a dreary little fantasy which has nothing to do with the historical <UNK> but merely uses his name to give a certain <UNK> to <UNK> idiotic story about an african superhero who is a combination of jesus lincoln superman and nelson <UNK> br br on the other hand there are a few laugh out loud moments as when <UNK> breaks the cross to which he is <UNK> and kicks some serious <UNK> butt you know like jesus would have done if he hadn't been such a <UNK> br br true i saw only the 98 minute version but i can't imagine that twice as much of this crap would have been better br br and what kind of a name is <UNK>
<START> this is <UNK> one of the best stand up shows <UNK> ever eddie is so off the wall that i've been watching this damn show for nearly five years now and it still rocks every single time just everything from his big broad physical comedy down to the little off the top of the head side remarks it's a <UNK> you need look no further than this line the word <UNK> you say <UNK> and we say <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a f ing h in it brilliant
<START> the film was made in 1942 and with world war 11 around the movie industry decided to capitalize on the fact that spies were around br br the film is fun to watch due to the fabulous dancing of <UNK> powell the late miss powell was certainly a great <UNK> in every sense of the word she is again paired with a very young looking red <UNK> here the two of them also starred in i <UNK> it br br <UNK> olsen who 3 years later was superb as the <UNK> police officer in mildred pierce again appears as an officer asking powell to deliver an item trouble is that olsen and his <UNK> are really the japanese spies br br bert <UNK> is his usual brilliant self here and he gets ample support from virginia o'brien
<START> from everything i'd read about the movie i was excited to support a film with a christian theme everything about the movie was very <UNK> done especially the writing without good writing a movie doesn't have a chance the writer director said in an interview that he didn't want to give away how the title relates to the story believe me it was no big surprise i kept waiting for the teenage young adult back story to unfold but it never did as someone who has gone through a divorce i was very disappointed this movie would have been no comfort to me when i first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a christian
<START> i was just a bit young for this one but i had to see it there's some excellent music which many folks have mentioned but no one seems to notice a very rare appearance by angel a now mostly ignored but once quite popular musical outfit wearing their trademark white outfits they <UNK> through 20th century <UNK> and apparently all try to <UNK> into the <UNK> field of vision <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> remains the bands highlight and has apparently never gotten much of a <UNK> ever <UNK> <UNK> ex <UNK> singer begins a brief but notable acting career here and is quite memorable alongside jodie foster and the rest her topless 3 d scenes in <UNK> and her <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> kept us all watching her for a time br br it's not a masterpiece but it <UNK> a <UNK> of its period for all to <UNK> upon and wonder
<START> <UNK> is an example of one of bollywood worst overrated movies ever directed by anil <UNK> who prefers making period related movie gives a rubbish movie the songs were boring and ain't the kind of song you want to listen to in your car full volume sunny <UNK> is famous for making <UNK> movies where he beats up a 100 bad guys on his own he even kicks a metal jail door indian and kicks a moving car far away <UNK> <UNK> i can give another 50 examples of <UNK> action by sunny <UNK> but i'm sure most people know this already sunny gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same type of role a guy claiming to be fighting for his countries piece by using violence <UNK> <UNK> is hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that i would love to bone but even she couldn't save the film from being a disaster instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does in this movie she doesn't maybe <UNK> she was playing a muslim but she doesn't act like one in the movie overall this is a poor show all the way i'm sure it will appeal to some people who love seeing the bollywood actor beat up 100 guys give me a break
<START> to make it short and not to spoil everything this film is about <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> a car thief who <UNK> up a big delivery of stolen cars 50 in total he is then threatened to be killed by the man who gave him the <UNK> the objective now is to get 50 cars stolen in 3 days with the help of randall nicolas cage a <UNK> <UNK> and also <UNK> brother and a couple of old friends of <UNK> as you can see this is the same old big <UNK> needs to get <UNK> <UNK> out of trouble routine and of course randall is the best thief there ever was of course as in all other movies there are also a few <UNK> and surprises you never would have thought of but at times it is predictable too so there is nothing fancy about the story br br you are by now probably wondering why this is about <UNK> times the hot stuff since there are only 50 beautiful fast cool and expensive cars to be stolen well the other hot item in this film is <UNK> angelina jolie who will be a big star trust me she is not only very convincing in the role as a car <UNK> but she is pretty hot too ok not hot as in pretty but hot as in damn cool and sexy she was very believable in this role probably because she is some kind of a wild woman in real life too don't believe me read her biography and for the sexy part well just see for yourself man i only know that she plays the kind of girl i like in this film because she is not too mainstream a bit alternative look and she even comes with a <UNK> br br ok the only <UNK> i felt while watching this movie was that there is not very much action there is one totally unrealistic scene the story is only ok and that there are not much jokes hey but after seeing the whole film i must say who cares why must i say that well because it was still entertaining had a couple of cool car chases good music some bruckheimer scenes where the combination of music and the lines of actors make your eyes go wet good actors who all did their jobs pretty cars one cool wild sexy lady yes i mean mrs jolie and last but not least very nice and cool tools to boost the cars with so some <UNK> here but still a pretty good and entertaining movie all in all the best way to describe this film is that it is an overall ok movie with a cool  <UNK> ending br br as for nicolas cage <UNK> he is actually one of my most favourite actors in the action genre nowadays after such good films as the rock con air face off snake eyes and finally this one plus what actor has had so many good action <UNK> in the last years and such successful ones well no one maybe jackie chan but he is one of my favourites too one thing that is true though about mr <UNK> bruckheimer films is that they keep getting worse the rock was a clear 9 con air was a nice 8 and this well this clearly is a 7 not that that mark is bad does it not show that his films under bruckheimer keep getting worse and that maybe cage has to think longer before he accepts a role in a movie and probably he should make a few less movies no it doesn't show us that because almost all of <UNK> films were successful in the last few years except for <UNK> and bringing out the dead <UNK> was not great i admit that but that was never <UNK> fault and the story seemed good to me about the latter film i can not say anything <UNK> i have not seen it yet one thing though i know for sure if bruckheimer would have asked me for those three films i would have said yes to all of them i would have said yes to the rock because the story was great and because you would get to play with sean connery and ed harris i would have said yes to con air because there would be a lot of action in it because the story was good and because you got to act with john <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> in this one i would have starred because i would have gotten a big <UNK> i would have been able to ride some cool and fast cars and because i would have been able to kiss angelina jolie can't wait to see her in that lara <UNK> outfit this one was a good choice of mr cage and it certainly was worth a look at in the theatre br br 7 out of 10
<START> the danes character finally let's buddy have the awful truth leave me alone kiss men if you want to she screams self <UNK> in front of everyone thus destroying the man who has been in love with her for so long nice girl this might be the place to <UNK> all of the <UNK> charm that danes <UNK> into this character great reason to feel sympathy for her lying in bed and dying but hey remember there are no mistakes except maybe seeing this film br br wait a minute this irony is intended this is actually a masterpiece of ironic wit yes but somehow i doubt that's what the creators of this film had in mind sadly maybe there are a few mistakes after all
<START> an ok movie about downs syndrome a mother has twins one is very sick the other is good but he has downs the mother does not think she can raise him so she gives him to some people who have 15 kids 11 have downs the mom does not like this she thinks he should be with his family i agree too so they take it to court the family gets broken up the grandparents lose it never really says if the mom daughter makeup i think this movie's good but the plot is familiar it's still good has a few unintentional laughs
<START> how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long it's terrible it makes me want to shoot someone it's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci fi movie i'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense i remember watching it when it first came out i thought hey this could be interesting then i found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table br br please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they're the trash that is <UNK> the networks and <UNK> quality programming that requires some thought to create
<START> br br human body wow br br there are about 27 000 <UNK> in human life br br hardly one thousand <UNK> will be watched by 90 of humans on this planet br br our days are limited br br excellent movie for all women makers of human body br br thanks and regards br br
<START> the dirty harry series began with very gritty cop action and was almost immediately <UNK> up for <UNK> force by the time that the <UNK> rolled around dirty harry was little more than a television cop show saved only by <UNK> <UNK> after a break of seven years dirty harry has finally gone back to his roots maybe he's been gone for too long this time br br clint eastwood makes the first well directed harry film since don <UNK> made the first which helps considerably harry is a darker character once again not the nice cop he had become he can once again say things like go ahead make my day and really mean it sudden impact is a true dirty harry sequel the <UNK> should never have been made br br 7 2 out of 10
<START> the premise is a bit better than the execution but that doesn't mean the film is worth a look splendid supporting cast makes this a fun mystery to unravel raines is great as the <UNK> woman determined to solve this <UNK> i always enjoy thomas <UNK>
<START> this is one of the best animated movies i've ever seen in my life this isn't just a fun movie or a well made movie this is a landmark in the art of animation and even if it weren't just the technical skill that went into making it would grant it a place in the history of animation br br <UNK> <UNK> created a stop motion movie about the secret life of <UNK> he imagined a coherent world of insects with jobs houses <UNK> movie houses even little props like posters and <UNK> and paintings br br in this movie he tells a simple tale of <UNK> and revenge mr beetle has an affair with a dancing <UNK> much to the <UNK> of a <UNK> but he's a cameraman and decides to shoot the <UNK> mr beetle returns home and finds mrs beetle having her own affair mr beetle chases the lover away but <UNK> his wife the two make up and go out to the movies and the movie they watch is mr beetle and the <UNK> described thus it sounds banal but once seen it becomes a gripping work of cinema along with <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> pretty much invented everything that future animators would use in their work for that reason he must not remain forgotten
<START> this movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made i've seen this movie for the first time a week ago since then every day i see the opening and every time i feel as thrilled as i felt the first time i heard david niven <UNK> the immortal words from sir walter <UNK> the <UNK> br br give me my <UNK> shell of quiet my staff of faith to walk upon my <UNK> of joy immortal <UNK> my bottle of salvation my <UNK> of glory <UNK> true gage and thus i'll take my <UNK>  br br do you know why it would be a <UNK> to say michael <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> lives are thoroughly justified for having crafted such a wonderful opening because they had been already admitted in the paradise of <UNK> long before they made this movie br br i imagine both of them facing trial during <UNK> and saying <UNK> to an <UNK> god i beg your <UNK> sir so do you want to know what have we done during our lifetime well well you'll see we've written directed and produced i know where i'm going colonel <UNK> red <UNK> do you think that enough sir it is rather obvious that these two great artists had already <UNK> their duty with god nature the <UNK> or whatever you may call it when they shot a matter of life and death the fact that other people's lives would be justified for their deeds could be not apparent to everybody notwithstanding i feel my life would have a meaning had i never done anything else that to see this movie br br of course old <UNK> will be tempted to say they don't do movies like this one any more they'll be partially mistaken they didn't make movies like this in the past times either br br i've have already <UNK> <UNK> here but i'll repeat his words a thing of beauty is a joy forever
<START> like my sassy girl this movie is based on a true story posted from the internet but that's where the similarities end the story is generally about this rebellious guy named <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sang woo who is still trying to finish high school whose parents hire a <UNK> named <UNK> wan kim ha <UNK> a woman who comes from a poor background but happens to be the same age as him add to that some obstacles martial arts thugs are always after <UNK> <UNK> for revenge a <UNK> <UNK> love sick girl who is after him his <UNK> for <UNK> the lessons and you generally can guess the whole story did i mention it's a romantic comedy this movie has some good fight scenes great visual humor and a lot of <UNK> thanks to the good chemistry between kim ha <UNK> and <UNK> sang woo that bring a lot of energy to the story the romantic elements also work because of that reason and i must say i'd want a girlfriend more like kim ha <UNK> than that girl from my sassy girl personality wise at least she has some <UNK> but it's more on the cute sweet good hearted way characters are already mostly likable so one might say it had less of a hill to climb than my sassy girl an <UNK> that worked for that movie to its credit and the movie is quite clever and interesting most of the way the story kind of <UNK> though about 2 3 of the way where it sort of <UNK> on familiar standard fare where nothing really interesting happens but near the end it picks up a bit again overall a fun cute movie 8 10
<START> the photography of this <UNK> budget production is surprisingly bad colors are <UNK> and <UNK> and the photography has very <UNK> look to it direction and editing are often quite uninspired and tv movie like too and at first the movie only seems to want to torture its viewers with lurid images of sex and violence hans <UNK> score is also a typically simple and bland work of this overrated <UNK> composer br br but if you are willing to watch the movie further you are rewarded with a very moving family story a sort of european version of <UNK> <UNK> family <UNK> giant while at first you wonder why clara married this idiotic man even his character gets more depth and more background one can judge him by clara delivers the movie's spiritual lesson a great and moving statement set against the terrible happenings in her country her daughter whose lover is a young antonio <UNK> at the beginning of his international career understands that lesson and ultimately tries to live by it the way the plot was constructed with the ending <UNK> the beginning was great the actors all do a great job too i was wondering who is the actress playing <UNK> all the time but of course it was a really young <UNK> <UNK> br br all in all this movie really made me want to read the book
<START> this show is awesome i have been a fan since it premiered and it only keeps me watching i've seen some terrible things here that i wish i hadn't but it really shows you how addiction affects all involved not just the addict you can see all kinds of different <UNK> from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict or the eating disorder addict and actually it's really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through also we've seen accomplished musicians an <UNK> player and even young people who really need the help and since they have started showing a few follow ups that's been awesome too now you can see how they are a long while after their <UNK> aired if you haven't checked this one out please do it's on a e and it's awesome the new <UNK> are sunday nights at <UNK> <UNK> if i remember correctly so set your <UNK>
<START> richard <UNK> is an animation god he was <UNK> in directing this film by the producer the final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story but some amazing moments of animation like <UNK> <UNK> greedy joe <UNK> repetitive music doesn't help either it was made in wide screen so the vhs doesn't show it in all it's glory let's hope for a <UNK> dvd someday still it's worth watching for some eye popping animation
<START> i absolutely love all of tom robbins books so i was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of his books i knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of <UNK> magic but after seeing the movie it made me never want to read the book again the movie even <UNK> get the blues doesn't include an <UNK> of the content in the book and it seems to focus more on the love connection between bonanza <UNK> and sissy than anything else along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie i think that better actors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters the only actors in the movie that i thought played their roles fit to <UNK> <UNK> in the book were <UNK> friends in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie but as a huge tom robbins fan this movie was nothing but a disappointment
<START> i saw that movie few days ago this movie is so great that it makes me feel that if you want something really bad that you have always <UNK> about it you can have it this shows a big wish come true <UNK> happiness and sadness hopeless and failure but if you are strong enough and your heart really belongs to something that you love you can make things different and be happy
<START> can you say all shock no plot there were so many <UNK> directions in this movie there was no history about the room other than the deaths why was it evil what made it that way why an hour <UNK> then there were the <UNK> things hinted at for example we saw a camera in the air <UNK> which he mentioned but when he <UNK> up said <UNK> there was no camera br br how about the fact that all the ghosts looked digital and things <UNK> out before hitting the ground making a static noise hmmm when you put all of those things together it makes room <UNK> look like a high tech <UNK> house except that there was no follow up on that br br oh by the way <UNK> don't work in <UNK> well except for the tv the cell phone has no <UNK> but <UNK> internet works fine how many <UNK> can you possibly add i'm sorry but this film was nothing but shock after shock it's all been done before <UNK> in the mirror things just out of site changing paintings bleeding walls the oh it was all just a dream no it wasn't and if the room was evil why make our main character come to terms with his daughter's death if it was going to keep him trapped there forever anyway it just didn't make sense br br additionally there was no background information about the first book that he wrote just some vague information about the dad was a jerk and so forth speaking of <UNK> what was with the bit about his father you'll be in my place br br overall a truly horrible movie it was 100 <UNK> shock factor without any new or innovative effects and certainly no back story character development etc br br my overall impression is that the entire movie was made on the cheap pretty much using one set and a couple of location shots and was nothing but an effects film of recycled cheesy seen that before effects
<START> the man in the moon is a beautifully realistic look at life through the eyes of an adolescent director robert <UNK> magically re creates screenwriter jenny <UNK> autobiography of her childhood with gorgeous cinematography and a haunting lyrical musical score this film hits home as one of the most powerful and emotionally affecting films in recent times br br this film is incredible all the acting first rate especially sam <UNK> and an astonishing performance by reese <UNK> in her film debut you will feel every emotion as this life changing summer in 1957 on the <UNK> family farm comes to a conclusion br br the man in the moon was a limited release in 1991 and you will love the fact that most of you're family and friends will probably have never heard of it buy this dvd and enjoy 100 minutes of pure poetic art this film is <UNK> the essence of <UNK> at its finest
<START> ok so mr <UNK> company which is involved in some dubious business with former italian <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> produced a horrendous <UNK> mash by a mr carl <UNK> br br what is this horrendous <UNK> mash i'm talking about well <UNK> took three entirely unrelated japanese sci fi animated series namely <UNK> southern cross and <UNK> added tons of dialogue believing firmly that the american audience is too dumb to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence edited the whole lot heavily for violent content added some <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> dubbed it using some of the worst voice actors this side of acting hell <UNK> <UNK> singing was and still is unbearable and a total outrage especially compared to mrs <UNK> <UNK> and the result was an 85 episode series with hundreds of continuity problems and plot holes br br of course the <UNK> were cool to look at especially those in the <UNK> saga and the plot parts that remained <UNK> were good but whatever was good about <UNK> was not the result of <UNK> work or the voice talents he <UNK> it was because of the <UNK> and efforts of the uncredited why would i be too bold to <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> here japanese creators those of us who eventually got wind of the real deal and compared the originals to <UNK> now wish we had never been exposed to <UNK> the originals are so much better naturally and make a lot more sense br br <UNK> however did something worthwhile it <UNK> legendary anime creator <UNK> <UNK> to start a campaign for the protection of japanese anime <UNK> intellectual property from such <UNK> and <UNK> for <UNK> that talentless people like carl <UNK> produce
<START> once i watched the tenant and interpreted it as a horror movie it uses many of the <UNK> of the genre the sinister apartment suspicious neighbors <UNK> mysteries hallucinations the life of the hero <UNK> seemed surrounded by evil secret forces trying to drive him mad br br last time i watched it i challenged this initial interpretation if this movie is a horror movie it's only horror in the sense that a <UNK> novel is horror in fact this movie can be understood on a literal level as a lonely man slowly becoming crazy without any <UNK> influence br br polanski made in his career three movies dealing with madness <UNK> which i don't particularly like because the development of madness in the heroine never convinced me rosemary's baby in which the heroine is driven mad by evil forces and the tenant which might be the best study of paranoia ever made in cinema br br <UNK> is a young man who <UNK> an apartment in which a woman killed herself he becomes obsessed with her and slowly starts becoming her he wears her clothes puts on makeup talks like her but is he being possessed by a spirit or is he just letting his wild imagination get the best of him it's this <UNK> between what is real and imaginary and which polanski never <UNK> that makes this such a fascinating movie many events in the movie can be attributed to the supernatural as easily as they can be to normal causes and it's up to the viewer to decide what to believe in br br although this is not my favorite polanski movie it is nevertheless a good example of his ability to create suspense and portray madness in very convincing terms and technically speaking it's a marvel too suffice to say he <UNK> with film composer <UNK> <UNK> and legendary director of photography <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> in the making of this movie a slow pacing and sometimes uninteresting segments may make this movie difficult to enjoy but it's an experience nevertheless
<START> talk about a blast opening <UNK> <UNK> has the coolest opening credits ever guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary friday the 13th theme <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> ha ha ha the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant <UNK> promising intro of a totally obscure mexican slasher backwoods survival thriller and it only becomes <UNK> with every minute that passes two extremely <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar according to a newspaper article there's a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it the challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be <UNK> the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls upon arrival however it quickly becomes obvious they're not up against a bear but a <UNK> and utterly <UNK> war veteran with quite an <UNK> of weapons in his <UNK> and numerous combat tricks up his <UNK> after a whole decade of tame and derivative american slashers this early 90's mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid the formula is simplistic but efficient the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the <UNK> with the <UNK> killer is reasonably suspenseful the maniac must have been a fan of freddy krueger and michael myers as he also uses a self made <UNK> with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face the murders are <UNK> nasty and <UNK> which i was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood the <UNK> setting and particularly the <UNK> <UNK> traps are <UNK> spectacular <UNK> internal is a mexican slasher survival sleeper hit that comes <UNK> recommended to the fans of the genre
<START> i got this one a few weeks ago and love it it's modern light but filled with true <UNK> of life it questions and answers just like other <UNK> fox movies this is my favorite along with <UNK> jagger this pictures a lot more universally than only the <UNK> we may live in you don't need to be jewish or homosexual to enjoy this i'm not but the movie goes directly to my top ten movies at first it seems like pure entertainment but it does make you think further relationships we have to live with are superficial meaningful deep fatal you name it you don't know what's coming and you definitely don't know where this story is heading as you watch it the first time it is worth seeing several times fox movies include great bonus material here a great music video and the making of including explanation of the title <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> who plays himself in the movie and <UNK> with doubts about the israeli life styles
<START> the film is exceptional in it's gay <UNK> and <UNK> this beyond the <UNK> to the music and cast throughout the whole film exists a <UNK> wonder as seen through the eyes of the main character her lighthearted take on the world around us is comical and beautiful in a way it's a <UNK> movie for girls watch this is you fancy a relaxing entertaining mid night movie buy this if you like <UNK> takes on the world of media and love combined
<START> i've seen my share of woody allen's movies and while they're not always great you can usually be sure you're going to be entertained probably the last really good ones were bullets over broadway <UNK> and mighty <UNK> <UNK> since then the ones i've seen have been <UNK> but watchable and so when i was invited to see the new woody allen movie melinda and melinda which i wasn't even aware had been released yet i went along happily i hadn't really heard much about it so i hoped i would be pleasantly surprised br br what i got was definitely the worst woody allen movie i've seen the premise is over explained the cast is terrible the script is slow and lifeless too many scenes said nothing and yet were stretched out i assume to fill out what would have otherwise become a 15 minute short film br br i don't mind the concept behind this film two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy and obviously the film proceeds to show us that by playing out both scenarios the problem is neither of these <UNK> <UNK> are any good at all the comedy isn't funny and the tragedy isn't very tragic it seems like allen came up with a good idea but then ran out of steam or time to actually complete the film br br the general level of acting is notably bad also will ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table and it's basically a woody allen impression previously good actors like chloe <UNK> just come off as annoying and the worst of the bunch is <UNK> mitchell as melinda which is a shame because her character is in nearly every scene br br to be fair to the actors the script they are working with is lacking if not non existent definitely a long way from the allen we know and love from classics like manhattan or annie hall
<START> i've never found <UNK> chase very funny even though his on screen character sometimes reminds me of john <UNK> whom i find very funny <UNK> chase also reminds me of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> comics page in <UNK> best films i tend to admire his <UNK> rather than laughing at him i'll give chase credit that his very best films such as <UNK> like a <UNK> and <UNK> wooden <UNK> have inspired a <UNK> who are <UNK> loyal to him but i'm positive that even the most die hard chase fan will agree that the very early and very crude <UNK> to <UNK> just isn't funny at all br br chase eager awkward <UNK> <UNK> is a young <UNK> hoping to court the fair rose oliver hardy gives the best performance in this film as her <UNK> father who <UNK> chase as a <UNK> leo white who did more notable work as a foil for chaplin at <UNK> is on hand here as a rival br br there's some action involving an <UNK> watch i was intrigued that the brand name is mentioned in the dialogue titles is this an early example of product placement br br sadly a major flaw in <UNK> to <UNK> is the casting of <UNK> <UNK> as rose she's meant to be a standard issue <UNK> but <UNK> flat <UNK> <UNK> faced is physically wrong for the role <UNK> the wife of harry myers had a successful career as a screen actress but was never a believable <UNK> film <UNK> william k <UNK> dealt with her very <UNK> in one of his film books br br i'll rate <UNK> to <UNK> just 3 out of 10 and i'm being <UNK> because i keep <UNK> that <UNK> chase has got something that everyone else gets but i keep missing
<START> <UNK> <UNK> new film h g <UNK> war of the worlds the first faithful adaptation of the original novel has been in development for about 5 years a theatrical release was intended for earlier this year march 2005 but this never happened the dvd was rushed out to <UNK> with the release of spielberg's version which hits theatres june <UNK> br br i liked this film with certain <UNK> br br how faithful is the adaptation it's not quite 100 faithful to <UNK> book but 90 95 faithful is good enough for me at least several scenes were totally new such as <UNK> the <UNK> confrontation with a farmer and the <UNK> writer narrator <UNK> having tea with his cousin but on the whole this film follows the book very closely certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by george pal br br its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget the majority of it seems to have been shot blue screen and <UNK> with <UNK> rendered backgrounds this is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots and scenes of crowded city streets the <UNK> of <UNK> london look like something from a video game numerous scenes in horse <UNK> were <UNK> i guess they couldn't afford to rent a horse the only scenes shot for real seem to be those in open fields or <UNK> br br but within those budget <UNK> they managed to do quite a lot artistically the film looks right the martians and their <UNK> are quite well done and very true to <UNK> <UNK> i was particularly impressed with the heat ray although the thunder child sequence which should have been one of the film's highlights is very disappointing it's a great shame that they couldn't afford more actual sets or better quality animation br br the acting and direction won't win any oscars for the most part they are competent not bad but not outstanding the music is quite good also though not on a par with any of the major hollywood <UNK> br br i'm actually glad this didn't get a theatrical release because the budget <UNK> would have made it look much worse on a big screen as it stands i would rate this similarly to a bbc tv adaptation of classic literature br br a few <UNK> most of the scenes are presented with various colored <UNK> mostly red this may have been an artistic choice but it is used very <UNK> and seems more like a sloppy job of <UNK> the dvd and the writer <UNK> obviously fake <UNK> <UNK> from scene to scene br br bottom line is it worth seeing if you can look past the technical and <UNK> limitations and get into the story i think you will enjoy this especially if you've actually read the original h g wells novel if however you are easily put off by cheap production values you'd best pass on this unless you're a mst3k fan be warned however that the film runs a full 3 hours so i don't recommend watching it all in one sitting br br btw an entirely different version of war of the worlds aka invasion came out on dvd the same month that spielberg's hit the theatres http imdb com title <UNK> this was also made on a budget but is updated to the present day like the spielberg film but it's much better and to top it off jeff wayne is making an animated film of his best selling album from 1978 but that won't be out until 2007
<START> i love this show i watch all the reruns every day even though i have seen all of them like 6 time s each br br it's about two sisters holly amanda <UNK> and val <UNK> <UNK> who live in new york holly goes to live with val when their dad is transferred to japan val has the perfect life she has a boyfriend and a perfect apartment of the upper east side br br the show basically shows all the problems <UNK> and holly go through the main problem is guys but also is about being responsible and other life choices br br holly is 16 and is a total free spirit while val is the complete opposite she is the organized has to have a plan to do anything kind of person br br the other characters are henry vince gary lauren and tina
<START> normally i don't like revenge films period but double impact has a little more than your typical revenge plot premise you see <UNK> has action accuracy exotic locales i e hong kong awesome gun battles and enough martial arts to satisfy your <UNK> for impressive <UNK> combat like all revenge flicks it has villains you'd love to throw out of a plate glass window on the top floor of a 40 story building however double impact has none of the <UNK> crap that <UNK> the plot and the <UNK> racist and <UNK> social stereotypes that <UNK> eye for an eye and death wish 2 br br but in the plot department double impact is as transparent as <UNK> wrap <UNK> and <UNK> parents were killed by a mob hit squad connected to a family friend with money problems or at least that's what i remembered the explanation of why the boys were talking in french accents is a lousy one it wasn't the <UNK> plot that made this movie bad but the use of clichéd lines and moves from other movies from lethal weapon to the princess bride really made it worse but nonetheless double impact is still watchable but why is that <UNK> movies like this have villains for example that greedy british guy that killed <UNK> and <UNK> parents and that lethal lesbian <UNK> chick you would love to hate with <UNK> of your being
<START> i went to a small advance screening of this movie on july 19th knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy adventure quest of some sort br br the plot line really is nothing like i have seen and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters in spite of what first impressions may give it isn't cheesy corny tacky or ridiculous and is actually highly entertaining and funny the flow is quite well done nothing seems rushed or dragged out the soundtrack for lack of better words is magical and adds much to the film as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or tv and even though i might have known what was coming at points i still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen to my knowledge not a single person left the theater during the entire movie br br my one <UNK> is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film and as brilliant as it is i can't figure out why
<START> i have to say that this was the worst film of <UNK> releasing alongside much better <UNK> which was also his directorial venture it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by <UNK> actresses and some silly comedy sequences i think <UNK> is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and david <UNK> had done in the past after giving some good <UNK> they also went on to loose their audiences so it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction give us more of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> rather than giving <UNK> like <UNK> <UNK>
<START> outrageously trashy karate horror thriller with loads of <UNK> gory violence and gratuitous nudity and a thoroughly preposterous and bizarre plot this is <UNK> and low grade entertainment that will appeal only to viewers with particularly kinky tastes but it's kind of <UNK> bad and i must admit that i wasn't actually bored while watching it 1 2
<START> having seen the short a number of times at horror movie <UNK> i believe it to be a humorous parody that <UNK> to the main point of its reference br br though the themes are <UNK> and stale to today's viewers it is by no means a <UNK> waste of time br br though being a student film gives little rise to an excuse the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no <UNK> br br as noted by another reviewer it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to <UNK> the viewing <UNK> with a <UNK> of joy sit back and <UNK> <UNK> through the film br br i think this short bread of a film should be enjoyed as an <UNK> for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it
<START> having been pleasantly surprised by sandra <UNK> performance in miss <UNK> i decided to give murder by numbers a shot while decent in <UNK> self <UNK> roles ms <UNK> performance in serious roles see hope <UNK> speed 2 28 days leave much to be desired her character is at the same time <UNK> confused and sexually <UNK> the sub plot of <UNK> past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character the two teenage boys gave decent performances although their <UNK> expertise and catch me if can attitude is <UNK> by stupid errors that scream we did it chris penn as the all too obvious suspect is wasted here as is ben <UNK> token partner love interest character br br spoilers ahead mediocre acting aside the biggest flaws can be <UNK> to a tv of the week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place and as mentioned the stupid errors <UNK> up a rare food on the murder scene an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor the two boys hanging out together in public a convenient love interest to cause <UNK> etc etc cause the view to go from being <UNK> to being bored and disappointed by the murderers the ending was strictly by the numbers and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie using the now cliched <UNK> of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so called intelligence the film <UNK> to arrive at it's conclusion a somewhat promising concept but poorly executed and weak in nearly every way out of
<START> over the past year uwe boll has shown <UNK> improvement as a filmmaker <UNK> out the competent in the name of the king a lord of the rings clone and the proudly vulgar post 9 11 satire <UNK> but then came seed and the counter was <UNK> to zero keeping his <UNK> for <UNK> and respect that much further out of reach and i'm a fan of the <UNK> films exhibit a uniquely screwball vision and are never dull br br <UNK> from his frustration over the savage notices his early films received seed is a <UNK> misguided attempt at social commentary and an even worse <UNK> at creating an iconic slasher mythology boll often seems to be taking a page from rob <UNK> successful <UNK> of halloween the antagonist is <UNK> seed will <UNK> a mute <UNK> <UNK> who's <UNK> <UNK> people and sits on death row awaiting execution after <UNK> <UNK> the beast he rises from the grave to seek revenge on those who put him there and so begins a string of wholly gratuitous mayhem br br trying to create a new millennium slasher in the vein of michael myers or jason <UNK> max seed is too <UNK> and boring to leave an impression ultimately resembling a washed up pro wrestler doing the <UNK> murders on a succession of equally boring victims furthermore <UNK> character and <UNK> message run contrary to one another the death penalty is wrong sure but are we really expected to sympathize with a soulless killer who's left a couple hundred corpses in his wake i think not br br meanwhile michael <UNK> acts like a <UNK> long lost brother to james <UNK> character on <UNK> a cop who sits at his desk a lot <UNK> through newspaper <UNK> and watching pointless stop motion scenes of <UNK> animals and people trapped in <UNK> <UNK> by the time he and a bunch of cardboard cops storm <UNK> <UNK> the sequence is so drawn out ill conceived the lighting is almost non existent and <UNK> despite a healthy dose of gore that it almost put me to sleep br br the shoddy film making isn't limited to just that sequence seed appears to have been shot by a drunken cinematographer since the camera <UNK> and weaves endlessly a technique that's more stomach turning than the gore itself these <UNK> takes of very little happening only draw attention to the meandering almost non existent narrative at 90 minutes the film is <UNK> enough to be considered a form of torture which might have been <UNK> intent all along br br pure genius i guess the <UNK> on me
<START> <UNK> the best screen version of <UNK> <UNK> ever made well yeah the plot is not so strong and evident as in the book sometimes meandering and <UNK> its suspense among aesthetic subtleties but the film is really and beautifully strange has an <UNK> and style that other versions with r taylor and the new one from <UNK> definitely lack it has the air of roman <UNK> the beauty of <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> christianity at least i believe it has <UNK> forrest and <UNK> did excellent job in portraying their characters <UNK> <UNK> seems to be the biggest success of the cast let alone <UNK> who is the one of the greatest actors ever and <UNK> the very essence of this dying world imho that's it that is the way it happened guys imho
<START> when i think of the <UNK> guilty pleasure type movies the first thing i think of are '80s slasher flicks really bad slasher flicks the formulaic type of film where all a script needed was 2 parts blood and several parts nudity to get made br br flash forward to the late <UNK> early <UNK> the slasher flick has been <UNK> with the success of <UNK> scream like in the '80s these films were formulaic <UNK> a lack of inspiration by <UNK> themselves as hip tongue in cheek parodies of the original slasher flicks of this recent blend of hip parody neo slasher flicks the only one worth seeing is the low budget direct to video cut br br like most of the other new slasher flicks cut relies on the production of a slasher flick in this case a fictional 1985 film hot blooded to make its commentary on the genre hot blooded never finished production because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film's killer <UNK> a bald figure with its mouth <UNK> close and dark <UNK> less eyes now 12 years later a group of film students whose professor was involved in the production have decided to go into the <UNK> tap the original surviving actress and finish the film but every time the film is screened or a scene is shot <UNK> returns and someone dies to quote the <UNK> will they finish the film before it finishes them br br this all sounds really bad and to a degree it is really is there such a thing as a good slasher flick there is no character development the new director is revealed to be the daughter of hot blooded 's original director whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled this would've been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot yet it's never mentioned again and like in all other slasher flicks there are just too many bodies to care about the actors aren't great even by direct to video standards but most are having fun with their characters and for those who aren't it's <UNK> character acting since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on hot blooded particularly whoever was lucky enough to play <UNK> cut 's climax has no big who <UNK> <UNK> of the killer like in the scream films it doesn't have the gimmick killings of the urban legend films what it does have is an original and interesting concept that is <UNK> by a this way we can write a sequel if it sells well ending but that's par for the course br br by any sensible viewing standards this is a horrible movie that should be avoided but this quality is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neo slasher flicks
<START> br br i just bought this movie on dvd and watched it for the first time the other night i've been a fan of <UNK> work for about 4 years now ever since i got out of high school i didn't grow up on this movie perhaps my mother kept me away from it it's definitely not for children not that it's bad in a graphic sense but that the themes would go right over most 10 year olds heads overall the animation was excellent considering this was made in 1978 1979 i thought the story followed the book fairly well in a loose sense but i am bothered that <UNK> didn't just add another 40 minutes or so and <UNK> on the return of the king parts that would've made it the ultimate movie i was bothered by it's abrupt end and then when i heard return of the king sucked i was bothered even more too bad it wasn't one great animation film it might have garnered a higher vote from me i give it a 7 i can only hope peter jackson will do the books justice with the new live action lotr
<START> once again proving his amazing <UNK> john <UNK> plays the <UNK> russian chess genius preparing for a comeback <UNK> and <UNK> an unlikely relationship with a <UNK> fellow resident emily watson at a <UNK> italian hotel they fall in love to the horror of her social <UNK> mother <UNK> james a wonderful love story whose <UNK> of chess might make it appear cerebral but in spite of its origins in a <UNK> story it certainly is not the romantic elements and the sense of time and place beat the psychological analysis hands down john <UNK> having appeared in barton <UNK> o brother where art <UNK> the big <UNK> proves that he is not <UNK> on <UNK> bros films to <UNK> his stature
<START> i really don't get how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling cheated out of <UNK> minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading <UNK> br br first of all surely they could have 2 found real irish people and some good looking women who could deliver their lines better than the washed up <UNK> porn stars <UNK> throughout this film granted the gore works but strangely it's not as <UNK> as you might think to see organs <UNK> out of the porn <UNK> hot <UNK> tight bodies left and right probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrific <UNK> acting you just want them to die in pain br br so if you don't care at all about the following br br acting seriously everyone sucked i've never witnessed this before everyone sucked br br plot some crappy horror movies are remotely linear or at the very least surprising this movie doesn't make sense unless you're as <UNK> as the writers obviously were br br theme nothing to learn from this film nothing to be scared about in bed at night nothing to contemplate or grasp or explain to others br br soundtrack crap crap crap music as ordinary and dull as the script br br scenery could have been this film's saving grace but no nothing pleasing here even the rocks are fake br br so yeah if you don't care about that and you're just a horny teen with bad taste in music and women this movie is for you positive comments interesting cinematography at times wasted on the other elements very realistic gore again wasted but the intestines scene is classic i agree with the mutant <UNK> <UNK> the fake accent problem
<START> i disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the <UNK> gang are shot up by the british the film effectively blames the people of <UNK> as being the cause of their own troubles it suggests that the 25 year war was a question of <UNK> and nothing to do with <UNK> <UNK> of ireland and <UNK> of its history i e <UNK> was created by britain in <UNK> <UNK> of the wishes of the rest of ireland br br the characters are portrayed as hapless fools even though i despise <UNK> <UNK> they were fighting for a cause maintaining their artificial <UNK> over the catholic community it is a known fact that british intelligence <UNK> with <UNK> during the war no doubt to keep the <UNK> at bay and <UNK> <UNK> br br <UNK> values about <UNK> <UNK> etc are <UNK> on to 1970s <UNK> and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique irish <UNK> which leads to violence the stupid song from the woman in the club old ireland of green fields blah blah is given a symbolic stature i e poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause tedious <UNK> cheap and nasty trash <UNK> has made a personal statement on a conflict which requires serious political analysis
<START> i first saw this film during and international film studies course i am a <UNK> <UNK> student and perhaps for reasons of years lived or wisdom <UNK> appreciated the slow <UNK> pacing of the film's narrative <UNK> with the heat and dust of an <UNK> <UNK> the story is deeply psychological <UNK> with multi layered symbolism and an <UNK> <UNK> of the theme of being the <UNK> in a land that one does not understand the understanding that does come is <UNK> with the <UNK> memories and <UNK> of the <UNK> made nearly 20 years ago it is also a <UNK> in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of <UNK> in <UNK> spaces clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered much more <UNK> filmed and heavily <UNK> works that have been made since reflect the same themes <UNK> nowhere in africa are two that in comparison perhaps make <UNK> seem pale and boring it has no <UNK> <UNK> action or extreme violence the struggles are mental emotional and subtle but that being said it is a fine film worth a viewing
<START> one of the most <UNK> and engrossing documentaries you'll ever watch while the story takes place in the <UNK> capital of <UNK> it provides an intimate look into political dynamics that <UNK> throughout the western <UNK> while essentially another chapter in the story of the u s backed latin american coup this film chronicles in real time what can happen when the <UNK> people are armed with <UNK> political <UNK> and courage br br the political insights offered by this film are <UNK> one gets clear examples of the private media as a <UNK> force for mass deception and propaganda we see the poor people of <UNK> <UNK> with the brutal realities of american politics one gets a clear sense of impending doom if the people fail to address the blatant <UNK> which has been abruptly and <UNK> thrust upon them by the <UNK> we also see the arrogance and <UNK> of the cia backed private media <UNK> and <UNK> who've <UNK> to bring <UNK> back under <UNK> <UNK> though <UNK> led by president hugo chavez the people of <UNK> are forced to act without him after chavez was <UNK> kidnapped by <UNK> <UNK> their response is the <UNK> of the film if one seeks an excellent portrait of what the u s government hugo chavez and revolutionary <UNK> are all about this movie is it
<START> there's nothing quite like watching giant robots doing battle over a desert <UNK> and robot wars does deliver sure the acting is lousy the dialogue is sub par and the characters are one dimensional but it has giant robots the special effects themselves are actually quite good for the period they are certainly not as polished as today's standards but it contains a minimum of computer graphics and instead uses <UNK> so it has aged fairly well its shortcomings are easily overlooked given the films short runtime and it does have a certain tongue in cheek humour in parts that make it quite enjoyable i would recommend this to any fan of giant robots or cheesy sci fi who is looking for a lighthearted hour of distraction
<START> i first saw this movie on television some years ago and frankly loved it charles dance makes one of the most terrifying villains anyone can imagine his sophistication is such a perfect contrast to the <UNK> good hero i have never been much of an eddie murphy fan but find his irritating portrayal here a winner a bit of <UNK> <UNK> through the looking glass charlotte lewis is to <UNK> a hackneyed phrase but the only one <UNK> <UNK> gorgeous some scenes are wonderfully created the dream sequence the bird the silly fight scenes and the climactic confrontation through it all murphy is the modern man suddenly dropped into an oriental myth a stunned and <UNK> version of kurt russell in his oriental fantasy romp like that movie we have james hong the <UNK> actor whose scenes however short raise the quality even of derek since 1955 hong has defined the fine supporting actor the class act of his profession the golden child is silly it is not perfect but it has so many redeeming features that it is an enjoyable and amusing fantasy well worth watching after four years i have seen the golden child again i enjoyed it even more it truly is great fun
<START> the movie had a cute opening i truly believed i was in for one of the best romantic comedies i've seen in a while there was something particular foreign about the way the movie was set up realistic yet somewhat abstract and mystical but then the story line started becoming more and more unrealistic to say that the ending was corny and predictable would almost be an understatement the most typical romantic ending where everything goes great for every <UNK> character a scene where the main character realises that he has made a mistake and chases the woman of his dreams only to confess his love for her in front of a sympathetic crowd of on <UNK> come on in the end the <UNK> <UNK> win <UNK> <UNK> loose you get the picture a waste of a potentially interesting movie
<START> spoilers let's start with the good of this film the <UNK> acting of <UNK> <UNK> and richard norton the rest of the acting is awful this isn't aided by the atrocious script the worst <UNK> is the villain <UNK> the head of an asian crime <UNK> played by <UNK> <UNK> i was laughing my head off as he was expressing his fury over having lost a bunch of money horrid performance patrick <UNK> isn't much better and his it's a hostile <UNK> line that's the remainder of the title of this film was delivered about as badly as one could do it there are no other main characters but no other actor actress distinguished him herself in this film we next come to the plot this should tell you all you need to know in the original rage and honor <UNK> <UNK> who plays chris <UNK> was a teacher in the inner city now she's a c i a agent or was it some other <UNK> agency sorry but this film was so bad that i don't even remember hmmm i can imagine what that c i a <UNK> process was like <UNK> what past job experience do you have chris i was a teacher <UNK> okay you're hired i only give it a 2 because of some decent acting and a nice plot twist at the end though we know that tommy <UNK> the secret villain will be caught
<START> this is your typical cheerful and colorful mgm musical from the early <UNK> and it's definitely on of the better ones to watch out there br br the movie got directed by the genre expert <UNK> minnelli and stars gene kelly in the main lead both did quite a few movies together back in those days of which this one is probably their best known one br br the movie itself actually managed to win the best picture oscar over the year which meant it beat out movies such as a place in the sun a <UNK> named desire the african queen <UNK> <UNK> the blue <UNK> death of a salesman that year a real accomplishment of course but at the same time also a bit too much credit for this delightful bright and entertaining movie br br when you watch this movie you surely will be entertained by it all which is also thanks to the movie its beautiful color look and the many nice characters within this movie the musical numbers are also all nicely done which is no big surprise when you have people such as <UNK> minnelli and gene kelly at work br br but really couldn't had everything that got told in this movie been done in <UNK> an hour less or so i mean we already know where the movie is heading to but yet it manages to stretch it out all for as long as possible not that it makes the movie drag in any parts it just makes it a bit overlong the movie could had also definitely been done with a few less musical numbers in it br br one of the better mgm musicals that is not without its flaws though br br 8 10
<START> a sweet little movie which would not even offend your grandmother saving grace seems cut from the same cloth as a half dozen other british comedies over the past two years underdog is faced with <UNK> finds the strength to challenge and learns something about him herself in the process br br widowed and thus broke grace is a master <UNK> and is <UNK> to help her friend employee matthew grow his pot plant he's been doing it all wrong so grace helps him out they realize that she is the perfect person to <UNK> pot which they can both benefit from he enjoys smoking she needs to raise <UNK> to pay her <UNK> br br highlight is grace travelling to london to deal some of her <UNK> dressed in what looks like the white suit john travolta wore in saturday night fever and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb br br <UNK> is always watchable and you can't say that about a lot of people well i can't anyway <UNK> is very good and <UNK> <UNK> who i liked in la femme <UNK> is memorable br br not profoundly moving or insightful but immensely entertaining and at a <UNK> 90 minutes feels like a walk with friends 8 10
<START> rated e br br i never actually owned a <UNK> 64 but i have played one many times in my opinion along with <UNK> bad fur day super mario 64 is one of the best video games for the <UNK> 64 system i have played this game plenty of times and its good every time if you have an <UNK> and don't have this game you should try to find it the original super mario bros games were side <UNK> video games but super mario 64 has a 3d mario in a nice 3d environment the game is sort of weird but there is plenty of things you can do in the game you play as super mario and once again you must rescue princess and the <UNK> power stars from <UNK> now you can do it in a 3d environment super mario 64 is a very fun and good <UNK> game and i recommend it br br 10 10
<START> i'll be honest with you i liked this movie it's a great zombie flick that is packed with action original ideas good acting but is also packed with bad zombie effects part iv entitled after death is also good i would recommend this movie to horror fans everywhere br br 10 out of 10 br br fans of horror movies like this should check out puppet master skinned alive <UNK> party massacre sleep away camp and other full moon pictures flicks for other <UNK> check out the other comments i have sent in by <UNK> on my name above this comment section
<START> the first cube movie was an art movie it set up a world in which all the major <UNK> of mankind were represented and showed how they <UNK> to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn't understand it was on the non literal level a man vs cruel nature plot where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end <UNK> to face a new <UNK> world beyond man's petty <UNK> a world where there were no more struggle but peace i rated cube a 10 out of 10 and it's a movie that was never meant to have any sequels br br the second movie <UNK> was a massive disappointment some of the ideas were kind of cool but in the context of the original movie both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning still for being fairly entertaining i rated it a 5 out of 10 br br the third movie cube zero while ignoring the second plays like a vastly inferior commercial b movie rehash of the first sans the symbolism there is no homage or tribute here there is only ripping off the same kind of plot with some elements <UNK> altered like having letters instead of prime numbers between the <UNK> an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say br br that we see something from behind the scenes means nothing because the <UNK> are just part of the big bad experiment the <UNK> of which we hear nothing of and in this movie those who get through to the exit like kazan did at the end of the first movie are just killed where the <UNK> is the sense in that that's just <UNK> stupid i'm glad i didn't pay to see this br br the production values and acting in cube zero are not too bad but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10
<START> robert altman is my favorite american director i must admit that i have enjoyed the films that are usually <UNK> <UNK> if only for giving me the pleasure of seeing a grown up and beautiful <UNK> <UNK> who was unforgettable as the little girl in forbidden games health for having lauren bacall carol <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and glenda jackson all in the same cast <UNK> for that splendid and surreal world shelley <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and the wonderful <UNK> locations o c <UNK> for its <UNK> of an anti <UNK> flick beyond therapy for all its <UNK> and for the presence of <UNK> page who for all her effort to look <UNK> <UNK> is taken for a <UNK> i have even enjoyed his one act tv movies like the dumb <UNK> and the <UNK> when there is not much plot to develop in his films you have wonderful performances from <UNK> john travolta kim basinger or jane <UNK> i perceive and enjoy the different approach and description he makes of the many different cultures of the united states it is a pity that his genius is seldom appreciated and that he is always forgotten when the time comes for giving out american <UNK> and awards he is not your typical mainstream <UNK> of fantasies he is more of a maverick so it is not surprising for me to find so many bad comments posted here about the <UNK> man his most <UNK> effort to date and to my knowledge i did not know there were so many people who thought like leonard <UNK> who does not like altman at all in this case one may dislike the <UNK> man but for me the reason has more to do with <UNK> than with the director screenwriter some of altman's <UNK> are here improvised dialogue great performances a funny <UNK> office with typical <UNK> <UNK> and secretary while some people find it boring i found the first act fascinating thanks also for the great cinematography by <UNK> <UNK> the man who shot red <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and farewell my <UNK> he has a way of showing us the same things we see in other american movies but under a different light through his <UNK> <UNK> almost everything seems new and different in this first act things were so logical and true wait until you get older you may get in trouble if you fall under the spell of someone younger and beautiful as <UNK> <UNK> i know for myself what i have done fascinated by someone who is younger than i am then you have robert <UNK> <UNK> menacing and mysterious character while that <UNK> storm is threatening <UNK> the second act gets a little phony and even funny because altman may have <UNK> it with a grin i remember laughing <UNK> in several instances with his ironic remarks i think he was <UNK> a bit of <UNK> <UNK> us preparing us for the third act which is plain hollywood <UNK> altman does it with expertise being a wise man and an intelligent director luckily he did not fall into the traps of today's action movies he was directing a tale of lust greed and death i was not disappointed a bit with the movie if i give it a nine instead of 10 it is because of <UNK> the american reader has turned him into a best selling author so why complain maybe we should thank altman for showing us the <UNK> in his stories the <UNK> the <UNK> and the silliness of them all however he does it with so much gusto and humor that i cannot but disagree with the negative comments for me these persons saw another movie and vice versa
<START> diego <UNK> <UNK> was and still remains as the best football player the game has offered not just an <UNK> but an artist this <UNK> if the 1986 world cup will forever live in the memories of every football fan around the world because of his tremendous and unbelievable goal which he scored against my own country england there's absolutely no point of <UNK> this star although i dont <UNK> spanish i can appreciate the <UNK> narrator he actually cries of happiness and can barely express his emotion anything i wrote can be senseless and difficult to comprehend but readers you have to watch this to know what i mean
<START> i really loved this version of emma the best kate beckinsale was awesome as emma and mark strong was very good as <UNK> the only complaint that i had was on mr <UNK> i can't believe that a man could <UNK> so much or be so selfish with his daughter's life she was a smart girl in the end though as always i love the places in which these jane austin movies were shot the settings are so <UNK> it makes me want to visit england so much <UNK> well as ireland and scotland i think the actors chosen for this movie were a good choice as well and all the other story lines <UNK> with <UNK> most excellently i am glad that i got to see this one as well
<START> i really didn't like this film the plot was very predictable typical american plot i'm sorry guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end and london has a <UNK> bank of london bank of england is what it really is i did however like the look of tracy island and the thunderbirds themselves and the brits were baddies apart from parker and lady penelope what was up with that oh and they kept on saying stuff like here come 'the <UNK> but it was never known as 'the <UNK> in the series why do that i'd like to see this re made in 20 years with more british cast i preferred the original series sorry
<START> this movie starts out <UNK> has some slow moments in the middle but generally moves along well has a few very good moments then peters out at the end of act 3 i was able to get to see this in la <UNK> 2 times with 2 different endings jason lee is a star but he is not <UNK> leading man he is humorous and holds his own but he is better served as a supporting actor julia stiles does <UNK> in a comedy role new for her but she doesn't <UNK> this movie the way a star of her caliber should for an actress who has so much potential 10 things save the last dance o it is hard to watch her continue to do roles that are so <UNK> and then not have her take the role and run away with the movie like daniel day lewis did in <UNK> <UNK> blair is a good young actress as well and does an <UNK> job i didn't expect an academy award performance from her and she didn't deliver one but her performance was adequate chris <UNK> delivers another film that is <UNK> <UNK> perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else i <UNK> like this movie but it is not a movie where you walk away and say <UNK> was great ' this <UNK> has been done so many times before and there was just not much new here the rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best in the movie and larry miller gives an incredible performance in a supporting role he could be the best surprise of the film if you want to go see a movie that will make you laugh a few times and have an enjoyable evening i can still recommend this film but unless they have changed the ending again leave during the church scene or you will surely be disappointed
<START> this could have been interesting  a japan set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly <UNK> american family  but falls flat due to an over <UNK> treatment and the <UNK> of both cast and director br br the film suffers from the same problem i often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare i e the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they're expected to besides it doesn't deliver much in the scares department  a giant <UNK> attack is merely silly  as generally the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally <UNK> way such as susan george <UNK> <UNK> friend of the family doug <UNK> and edward albert force feeding his daughter a bowl of soup br br at one point an old monk turns up at the house to warn albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually he's called upon to <UNK> the premises however history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation <UNK> created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which albert and <UNK> possessed by the spirits of their japanese predecessors engage in an <UNK> karate duel to the death at the end of the day this emerges an <UNK> time <UNK>  tolerable at just <UNK> minutes but in no way essential viewing
<START> dull cheap sci fi thriller made with an almost total lack of conviction a control room full of computers and other devices used to receive and <UNK> messages from outer space is run by only one man and is very poorly <UNK> at night and full of campy sound effects christopher lee is not only wasted but he also gives one of his few i'm here strictly for the money performances 1 2
<START> because this was simply awful 101 <UNK> was funny even if formulaic but this is nothing more than <UNK> drivel the same plot except with the story <UNK> from it the world's most intelligent and horribly annoying <UNK> tim <UNK> proving that he really can't do comedy <UNK> remembers <UNK> in <UNK> but that was his high spot it's all been downhill since then direction so poor that if a group of college students had made this you'd throw it in the bin and tell them to do it again properly this time <UNK> <UNK> better go back to <UNK> <UNK> whilst glenn close and gerard <UNK> ought to go into hiding for several years br br perhaps i could be too harsh after all i didn't manage to sit through the whole film it gets 1 10 only because i can't give it 0
<START> this movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action films ever put to film dolph <UNK> <UNK> with a japanese accent is funny enough but add really corny buddy buddy action to the mix an eccentric and over the top villain a clichéd love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time and you've got yourself quite the little suicide inducing cure for people who enjoy their life and up till watching showdown had never <UNK> killing themselves with a <UNK> br br i don't know if it's just me but the whole homosexual subtext is none too subtle there are constant references to male <UNK> and not by females either brandon lee and <UNK> talk about each other's <UNK> parts and in fact before going on a suicide spree brandon says to <UNK> in case we don't make it i want to tell you you have the biggest d i've ever seen br br now is this what a normal man would say to another man in an action film no less and would you want those to be your dying words br br later there's this gem br br dolph regarding the villain i would like to cut off certain parts of his <UNK> brandon man you've got a <UNK> br br as the guy at <UNK> com pointed out unfortunately dolph doesn't respond with <UNK> got a <UNK> i've got a <UNK> you're the one who decided that his last words should be about my <UNK> i was just gonna chop of his ears and his nose man br br this is relentlessly silly stuff and great fun if you're someone who enjoys receiving root <UNK> from <UNK> <UNK> without <UNK> it's about on par great fun for the whole family
<START> saw this in preview great movie wonderful characterizations witty and intelligent dialog actors were fantastic peter falk will be up for an oscar paul reiser was charming photography was marvelous reiser was at the theater when we saw the film and he gave a vivid account about the making of the film it had been a long dream of his to write a semi <UNK> account of relationships between sons and fathers and more specifically between him and his father this was achieved in a dramatic and entertaining fashion the supporting cast was well chosen and gave the film a feeling of family i recommend this film to anyone who is longing to see intelligent drama and wonderful performances
<START> i rate this movie with 3 <UNK> only <UNK> the girls knew how to scream this could've been a better movie if actors were better the twins were ok i believed they were evil but the <UNK> and youngest brother they sucked really bad it seemed like they were reading the scripts instead of acting them spoiler if they're <UNK> why do they freeze the blood vampires can't drink frozen blood the sister in the movie says let's drink her while she is alive but then when they're moving to another house they take on a <UNK> they're frozen blood end of spoiler br br it was a huge waste of time and that made me mad <UNK> i read all the reviews of how this movie was great how many awards this movie won and this movie was f ing s t
<START> about time they released this movie on dvd i know some say wb rush the release of this movie because of the <UNK> movie but how can you rush the release of a movie that's been in you <UNK> since 1976 br br i'm very disappointed with the dvd release of this movie no special feature no 5 1 <UNK> sound come on wb you can do much better then this the audio and picture quality on this movie needs some serious help br br seem wb didn't place as much time and attention to this movie because it is a black movie and my have okay sales they could have kept the cd which by the way dose not have all the songs the original cd has br br would i recommend this dvd for purchase yes because it is a classic film but wb need to go add some more special feature take notes from other group movies the five <UNK> or the temptation were you may view just the performance and the sound on both are much much much better than this dvd
<START> ah clichés clichés clichés they're a main part of a wide variety of horror films this one has a lot of them still it's stephen king one of the best masters of horror this movie was really good just too predictable and what horror movie doesn't have stupid people this one is <UNK> with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken pet <UNK> i found to be creepy a little the way everything is set up was really spooky but not terrifying for the most part the acting was somewhat believable the suspense wasn't that suspenseful but the entertainment level is set at a major rank my eyes were practically glued to the screen all stephen king fans must see this movie but as for anyone else expect an okay thriller
<START> i'm disappointed that reiser who wrote the film felt the need to use so much profanity for no reason whatsoever maybe that's his idea of adult films plenty of nasty words with bathroom humor thrown in i thought better of him and think less of him for this movie br br <UNK> acting and some moments of humor as well as some possibly important themes are what made me give it such a high rating br br this might be a good movie for adult children to watch and laugh over about their own folks and their <UNK> but the lack of consideration for audience families seriously <UNK> what could have been a family film but fails certainly not worth spending money on though it might be worth a watch for free on television
<START> well where do i start i think it's very insulting to the original annie with <UNK> <UNK> i love the film annie and i was expecting this to be a brilliant film but i was so disappointed the acting is awful the original annie came out a few years before i was born i'm now 25 and annie is still one of my favourite films so i was really excited to see annie 2 the acting was awful in the film were any of the characters original very badly written directed and acted this is not a film i wish to see again and any annie lover i recommend that you don't watch this film because it will only leave you very disappointed the young girls singing isn't bad but still doesn't compare to the original
<START> from the start this film was awful why was it that bad if it isn't the naked women not only in need of a decent plastic surgeon but also the expertise of a dentist followed by a free hand out of <UNK> <UNK> then it's the <UNK> old guy at the gas station who isn't so much crazy but more i'm not sure how to act a great deal so i will stare straight ahead and look as stupid as i can while pretending to shout in robotic tones about something in the woods then back to these naked <UNK> in need of a cure for <UNK> apparently without touching you and this is according to the opening scene they can cause a nasty looking red <UNK> on your neck which i assumed to be a <UNK> of flesh missing but just looks as though it could do with some <UNK> to clear it right up then you have sophie holland who plays ally i have never seen such <UNK> acting she is more of a me me me if i'm not having fun no one else is and i don't wanna do this so i won't and i'm the <UNK> cow on the planet i'm sarcastic petty and if i don't get things my way i will <UNK> kind of person reminds me more of a 6 <UNK> old girl's attitude i don't think it's even worth mentioning the dire camera angles that remind me of blair witch or how low budget the film actually was that when judd was <UNK> at the <UNK> door it was in fact open before he reached to <UNK> it from the other side this film is completely laughable if it were a spoof then it would have been successful only just though but as a horror film is was just plain wrong i can't even being to describe everything that went t <UNK> up in this movie i would run out of room although it was funny to watch andrew <UNK> <UNK> juice in his ear every time he opened his mouth while tom <UNK> character was completely blind to the two hiding under the table directly in his line of vision it was even funnier when these two thought they could escape on a god damn <UNK> which as we all know is <UNK> number one hated vehicle to get stuck behind since its so god damn slow so is it any wonder they don't get away with it and how many people do you know that can slice open their <UNK> and then run around for hours as if nothing ever happened no pain no <UNK> from blood loss nothing but the <UNK> part is when all of a sudden and i mean that literally it's one year later and molly is still wandering the woods after having escaped the <UNK> and then lo and behold shaun <UNK> picks her up of course not without a line to promote his books <UNK> admittedly he is one of my <UNK> authors but suddenly and with absolutely no hint of an <UNK> as to how and why she's evil herself and <UNK> <UNK> to his death then we cut to the crazy dude from the beginning suddenly wandering round the woods with a <UNK> can even after his <UNK> performance on why no one should ever venture there for whatever reason cue the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> each other around a bit for fun while crazy <UNK> <UNK> everywhere and here <UNK> the film finally my conclusion if you hadn't already guessed by now absolute rubbish there was no proper thought went into it at all whoever was aiming the camera needed firing and come to think of it so did 99 of the cast if the right director actors and budget got behind this it could have been decent but once again low budget english horror films but the rest of the genre the country and the english film making industry to shame and i'm english so i'm allowed to say that in fact the only decent and exciting part of the movie is in the first 15 20 mins when we watch it turn from night to day over a field type area all i kept thinking throughout this was jesus christ in heaven why oh why did you allow someone to make this its absolute <UNK> <UNK> but i can't turn a film off after i've started watching it unfortunately i had to watch from <UNK> <UNK> dawn afterwards just to remind myself that tom <UNK> does have it in him to act well if there was an option for 0 10 then believe me i <UNK> chose that <UNK> this film isn't even worth the one point i did give it br br but this is just my opinion watch it and decide for yourself
<START> <UNK> machine has got to be one of the most complex ridiculous awful and over exaggerated sci fi horror films that i have ever came across it is about good against evil and a coming of age tale with the aim of to entertain with bloody sleazy and humorous context because of that the violence isn't particularly gruesome and it doesn't make you <UNK> but the gratuitous <UNK> and nudity does run <UNK> the performances by <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> is the worst i have seen if that was not enough it is also directed by an <UNK> of director called <UNK> <UNK> this movie just have it all it is bad to the bone a must see for every b movie freak simply an enjoying and rare gem
<START> after a cold sex scene between andy and gina in south america we know that andy is a <UNK> manager who finds himself in a hard economic situation where he badly needs some extra <UNK> we also discover that he has been stealing from his job and using the money to his drug <UNK> he's also attempting to keep up with his wife who just might be having an <UNK> br br to solve all their problems he <UNK> his <UNK> likable <UNK> join him in a plan to steal their own <UNK> small <UNK> their parents are happily married and <UNK> of a jewelry store <UNK> in new <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> sixty thousand dollars is all they'll need to get their life out of <UNK> br br three main characters are important in this <UNK> br br first the two <UNK> each of them is a complex individual threatened with multiple motivations and sunk into doubts and <UNK> the two are desperate characters <UNK> and <UNK> br br andy is <UNK> he feels that he has never had the love of his <UNK> he is the <UNK> influence turning his brother into an <UNK> and his beautiful woman into an <UNK> br br hank is a puppet too weak to resist his brother's <UNK> his ex wife is one of the reasons he needs money as he owes her hundreds in child <UNK> he <UNK> to regain the confidence he once had with his <UNK> br br the third character is their weary and <UNK> father charles <UNK> albert finney especially in the haunting climactic <UNK> br br telling you more about the details could <UNK> the impact of the film and therefore the entertainment br br <UNK> performance conveys great depth and emotion even with her look her touch her particular <UNK> br br <UNK> direction is firm fresh and brutal
<START> having just finished <UNK> of the heroic knight mere minutes ago i find myself extremely please but questions still <UNK> over me while it would appear that the first 7 episodes or so are actually a retelling of the events of the first record of <UNK> war the truth is that they really aren't it would appear that the creator of <UNK> had a different vision as to how the original ended and that may be the reason that the first 7 episodes occur but i do not find that to be the case <UNK> does say it starts 5 years after the war of <UNK> which <UNK> was a part of i think the director made the first 5 episodes seem so much like a <UNK> of the original just to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to characters and their deeds done because they appear much less after the series kicks into <UNK> story now once the series does kick into <UNK> portion we find ourselves kicked up another 10 years 15 years now since the war of <UNK> spark and his crew do in some cases resemble <UNK> and his crew once the journey kicks into gear especially the love story that <UNK> between spark and <UNK> i also thought several times throughout <UNK> that i threw in the original series and if it wasn't for <UNK> long blue hair i know i would've pressed stop more than once to make sure the right disc was in by no means do i consider these major set backs however the writers did a fine job in <UNK> believable characters and a remarkable storyline the only thing that makes me hurt is that <UNK> and <UNK> return <UNK> how don't get me wrong both are great villains even though <UNK> only villainous <UNK> is that he supports the <UNK> perhaps i missed something during the coarse of the series that explained that part as far as sequels go though i highly recommend <UNK> i place both <UNK> and even more so the original record of <UNK> war far above the lord of the rings trilogy both of these are more epic than anything i've ever seen or read i highly recommend this
<START> snow white is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view the plot is pretty much <UNK> the characters are stereotypes the editing too exaggerated anyway the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions br br instead i think this is a straight commercial thing including a character from the french part of switzerland the actor is the leader of the band he is <UNK> with in the movie the <UNK> called <UNK> <UNK> seems to aim to a larger audience a straight german swiss movie would not have sold in the french part and vice versa what really got on my nerves were the product <UNK> all over the movie <UNK> scenes remembered of <UNK> clips br br i also think the topic of young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives is a wide spread reality in <UNK> therefore it should be <UNK> with more care i hope <UNK> got enough money with snow white in order that his next movie is gonna show his true artistic skills
<START> what seemed at first just another <UNK> french flick offering no more than <UNK> sentiment became for me on second viewing a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation br br spoiler of sorts follows br br poor cedric he apparently didn't know what hit him poor audience we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of <UNK> these two guys just didn't belong together from their first ambiguous encounter as much as mathieu and cedric were sexually attracted to each other the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for mathieu an intellectual being to find <UNK> in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more <UNK> to carnival <UNK> and <UNK> on the beach br br on a purely technical note i loved the camera action in this film subtitles were totally unnecessary even though my french is <UNK> <UNK> i could watch it again without the annoying english translation and enjoy it even more this was a polished very <UNK> made motion picture though many scenes seem superfluous i rate it nine out of ten
<START> what a shame that a really competent director like andre de <UNK> who <UNK> in <UNK> shifting <UNK> didn't get hold of this concept first he could have helped bring out the real potential especially with the interesting character played by william bishop as the movie stands it's pretty much of a mess as <UNK> by reviewer <UNK> the main problems are with the direction cheap budget and poor script the strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept characters pulled in different directions by <UNK> forces what was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by <UNK> the script into some kind of coherent whole instead of the <UNK> awkward mess that it is try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can also a bigger budget could have matched up <UNK> location and studio shots and gotten the locations out of the all too obvious la <UNK> the real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast hayden taylor before his teeth were <UNK> <UNK> reeves along with james <UNK> and william bishop shortly before their <UNK> deaths few films illustrate the importance of an auteur with vision more than this <UNK> obscure western which in the right hands could have been so much more
<START> this is the second movie i saw for <UNK> this past weekend the <UNK> being the first <UNK> was better i can only guess from watching this that the production must have been quite limited i will admit the story started out interesting but really <UNK> for me in the end we weren't really given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters which only made each of their <UNK> characteristics even more annoying i have to mention that there was also a bit of <UNK> casting with a 12 year old boy acting as sheriff the only reason i sat through the whole film was to find out what the big secret was which turned out to not be all that interesting some more background about the family would have helped but they didn't really seem like a family at all to begin with br br to me this film is so amateur that i couldn't even see putting it on dvd the four rating is for the initial potential the story might have had this was one to skip for <UNK>
<START> i was going through a list of oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat butch cassidy and the sundance kid for best picture in 1969 after actually seeing it however i'm not surprised anymore it was way ahead of its time in regards to its style cinematography and use of flashback to help develop joe <UNK> character br br the most amazing thing to me is the depth of joe <UNK> character in such a short movie i think voight captured the <UNK> and the <UNK> when <UNK> the two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the <UNK> in the theater and when the older man <UNK> him i think when he looks in the mirror he's trying to see if it's really him that has done or is about to do something terrible br br i think it was a brilliant decision by hoffman to take this role otherwise he may have been <UNK> after the graduate anyway this considered an all time great for a reason
<START> if you are a fan of really bad movies and you think there funny you will the great acting of <UNK> first off putting pro players in movies hardly ever works <UNK> had to of been the worst actor i have ever seen next to dennis <UNK> who also made a few bad movies well any way this movie is also bad due to the hideous kid i would give this a zero but that is impossible
<START> similar to on the town this musical about sailors on shore leave falls short of the later classic in terms of pacing and the quality of the songs but it has its own charms kelly has three fabulous dance routines one with jerry the cartoon mouse of tom and jerry fame one with a little girl and a fantasy sequence where he is a spanish lover determined to reach his lady on a high balcony sinatra playing kelly's shy inexperienced buddy and grayson the woman who serves as the love interest for both men do most of the singing iturbi provides some fine piano playing at nearly two and half hours it is a bit too long for a light musical but it doesn't drag
<START> that seem to be <UNK> people into seeing qualities in this film that are just not there br br near dark covered the same territory but with much more class and action br br why the script kept their <UNK> <UNK> so long was a total mystery to me i guessed it at the breakfast scene at the start of the film by the time it was revealed to the viewer it was just a case of <UNK> deal tell me something i don't know ' br br i found this to be pointless movie that may have challenged the genre conventions unfortunately those conventions are that horror films are tense and packed with genuine sense of horror this was <UNK>
<START> if alien jurassic park and countless other sci fi horror movies are your cup of tea add a lot of sugar and you'll get this one down the film begins in jolly old england around <UNK> and then jumps to present day california our hero <UNK> dean cain is the new security chief and military <UNK> for a science lab 400 feet underground he arrives <UNK> is also a helicopter pilot with the lead scientist and we soon find out it's a <UNK> lab and they have something newly found to clone is it a dinosaur or what as with the above movies all hell breaks loose and our characters start getting picked off the special effects on the monster are pretty good for a direct to video movie and dean cain does what he gets paid for but forget the rest of the group as we find out why we have never seen them before again don't go in with high expectations and you'll be ok
<START> a surprisingly complex and well crafted study of the first serial killer in the <UNK> set in the days of <UNK> this intense piece is brought to full life with the performances of stephen <UNK> and donald sutherland br br this examination of <UNK> as a killer is well rounded and by <UNK> at some of his <UNK> while out right showing others there is a subtlety that is compelling without being overtly graphic not for the weak of heart however as it's subject matter is often disturbing but necessary to it's full development of the main participants in this fact based story br br hbo has <UNK> us with an excellent film in an unusual manner <UNK> to the director and editor of this great piece it is in my top 10 must see list
<START> this was a movie about infidelity and revenge a twin with the twin connection senses that something is wrong with her sister this movie took forever to establish the plot a plot that has been done many times the acting was lousy for the most part once the plot comes together the movie ends laura and ashley are twins that live with an abusive father the father seems to favor ashley so laura gets the blame for everything there is a promise made that the girls would never be apart but as they grow up their lives go in different directions ashley gets a job in a diner where she meets barry a married man of course no good can come of this the fact that barry had <UNK> was a poor excuse for a way to track him down i kept waiting for this movie to get better and for there to be some resolution somewhere but it never happened
<START> my friend had the idea of watching the animated lotr after seeing the peter jackson return of the king so i finally bought it off e bay thinking right from the start it was going to suck actually it really wasn't as bad as i thought it would be the animation was good for its time they used a unique method of <UNK> live action with animation to create some interesting effects and the guy who did the voice for <UNK> sounded somewhat like <UNK> wood br br not the greatest adaptation of a book but trust me i've seen a lot worse it <UNK> quite a lot of things since both <UNK> and the two towers are <UNK> into one two hour movie <UNK> worth a watch kids might like but still <UNK> no <UNK> with the peter jackson trilogy
<START> in a year of pretentious <UNK> like <UNK> new york a film born out of charlie <UNK> own self <UNK> comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important <UNK> is a labor of love by the crew the actors and the filmmaker shot over years by friends it <UNK> a man who cannot communicate through his thoroughly authentic real brooklyn world the people that you see are a step beyond even the <UNK> of the <UNK> movement they are real people painfully trapped in their own self contained <UNK> unwilling to change unable the real world to them is their own set of <UNK> and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch it is very difficult to watch it is <UNK> film making without proper light money or any of the other factors that would make a film slick but its honesty can not be understated a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for richard <UNK> to give it an award as he did at <UNK> this does remind of films like naked or the best of the <UNK> it is a film that is not for everyone but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it
<START> needed an excuse to get out of the house while paint <UNK> left the movie after an hour to return and watch the paint dry br br i don't recall ever walking out on a movie before but i really tried to stay the script was not up to the cast and just kept going and going badly come on uma thurman doing this stuff fairly lame special effects these were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20 something lives just sort of annoying and wrong feeling br br this review is base only on the first hour it might have gotten better i just had to get home and see if the paint <UNK> a darker <UNK> than when it went on
<START> believe it or not at 12 minutes this film for <UNK> is a full length film very very few films were longer than that back then but that is definitely not what sets this odd little film apart from the rest no what's different is that all the actors with the exception of one frog are bugs yes bugs this simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of chaplin laurel and hardy or max <UNK> but instead this russian production uses bugs or i think models that looked just like bugs chaplin and laurel and hardy were yet to be discovered and i assume <UNK> was busy so perhaps that's why they used bugs using stop motion the bugs moved and <UNK> and fought amazingly well and a heck of a lot more realistically than king kong 21 years later br br the film starts with mr beetle <UNK> off for a good time he goes to a <UNK> club while his wife supposedly waits at home but unfortunately for mr beetle he is caught on camera by a local film buff plus he doesn't know it but mrs beetle is also carrying on with a <UNK> <UNK> painter of course there's a lot more to this domestic comedy than this but the plot is age old and very entertaining for adults and kids alike br br weird but also very amazing and watchable
<START> this is the kind of movie you regret you put in your vcr it is some weird bad rip off version of stephen kings movie misery 1990 i cannot understand how this movie got a 5 2 score because it has no story what so ever and when the movie finally ended i was <UNK> br br this movie should have been released as a short movie instead to much time is spent on the same thing and as in every bad movie everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10 15 minutes time span br br so before you decide to watch this movie be sure to put some new <UNK> in your remote control because you are going to do whole lot of fast <UNK> don't worry you wont miss anything important
<START> obvious attack on <UNK> made by people who don't appear to understand intellectual property or market <UNK> generally br br loony liberal tim robbins plays a painfully obvious caricature of bill gates and is a cartoonish corporate villain <UNK> murders right and left br br while <UNK> may engage in some <UNK> activity at times it's unlikely they actually murder people therefore the film is over the top and ridiculous from the beginning br br the deeper point is apparently that major tech <UNK> should be free to the public and not subject to intellectual property laws however this ignores the fact that most major <UNK> would never have been developed if not for the market <UNK> and <UNK> provided by intellectual property br br it's one thing to be opposed to anti <UNK> conduct that's common sense it's quite another to be opposed to market competition in the first place which is what the film's <UNK> knowledge belongs to mankind represents br br yet another example of hollywood being completely out of touch with reality
<START> this film is horrible bad acting bad writing bad music it's just horrible not only is it incredibly <UNK> of role playing games but the key elements of the film are poorly executed may the god i don't believe in have mercy on the souls of the miserable <UNK> who conceived and gave birth to this abomination
<START> i really enjoyed the pilot it was as amazing as i hoped it would be if not better patrick <UNK> was a riot although at first i thought that i wouldn't be able to stand his character him and <UNK> price had little chemistry at all but hopefully as the season goes on they'll get more comfortable around each other it must have been weird for <UNK> to go from being the star on her last show grounded for life to being a co star br br <UNK> <UNK> and oliver hudson seem really new to the whole sitcom scene but i think in time they'll get better david <UNK> character to my surprise wasn't the whole focus of this pilot the way he delivers his lines is so different from anyone else i've ever seen on tv but i think that it is just his style it works for him br br i think that couples or even <UNK> will be able to relate to all the doubts and fights and being unsure about your decisions that this show is about all the situations that the characters are put in just feel like real life not sugar <UNK> like most shows br br i hope for all the actors <UNK> that cbs gives them a chance this show has the potential to be one of the best series if just given the chance and time
<START> wow this is the worst movie ever the only reason i signed up for imdb was so i could complain about this movie i have never walked out of a theater or <UNK> a dvd but i almost stopped this one and i should have but i watched it all the way to the end just to get let down again with an absolutely terrible ending wow if this is all that wes craven can produce his time is long up i've never seen the first one and will never after watching this its terrible acting with a terrible plot hey looks someone is <UNK> a mirror at us lets go check it out and the sad part is that when this movie came to dvd it was completely checked out at blockbuster forever so i feel bad for all the people that saw this junk
<START> this is an amazing movie from 1936 although the first hour isn't very interesting for the modern viewer the stylish vision of the year <UNK> that comes <UNK> makes up for it however don't plan on being able to understand all of the dialog the sound quality and accents it's american but 1930s american make it difficult br br basically the story is a sweeping 100 year look at a fictional us town called <UNK> it <UNK> from 1936 when a war is on the horizon to <UNK> when technology leaps forward and creates its own problems br br the first one hour is a bit slow although it's tough to tell what audiences back then would have thought the events suspense and visuals are pretty low key in today's terms however when it gets to the future it's just plain fun to watch the large sets and retro sci fi look of everything is hard to beat br br unless you have great listening abilities this movie is hard to listen to i think i understood only 80 of the dialog it could use closed <UNK> br br if you're a sci fi fan this is one of the <UNK> classics and is a must see well at least after the first hour for the average viewer wait until there's a closed <UNK> version and then watch it if you're comfortable with movies of this time period
<START> in the opening scene the eye <UNK> wearing <UNK> named <UNK> has a smooth <UNK> but when he follows johnny into the <UNK> he's shown with a <UNK> over his <UNK> eye that's just one of the many continuity <UNK> in this edgy <UNK> western but rather than detract from the picture it adds a special flavor to the proceedings br br another occurs when <UNK> turns in his three dead bodies they have to be examined for their identities you just can't imagine how many false <UNK> we have in our town immediately after carradine lawrence <UNK> shows up to collect his bounty with no more than a wanted poster in hand br br as for the film's principal johnny <UNK> mark damon he's shown with his <UNK> alternately on his right and left hip throughout the movie after <UNK> gun <UNK> with carradine following the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> bound for san <UNK> at his <UNK> request but will have to avenge his death at the hands of <UNK> wife samantha <UNK> <UNK> and her conniving brother <UNK> louis <UNK> it takes some time getting there but it's a fun ride with one of the best music scores on record as for that saloon fight i got a kick out of the kung fu sound effects every time a punch connected br br care for some more story <UNK> following the duel with <UNK> the first time johnny <UNK> a small amount of blood from his lip which he manages to <UNK> <UNK> entire face with similarly when <UNK> <UNK> around little <UNK> later in the film he doesn't cut him but by the time johnny arrives <UNK> face is covered with blood br br johnny <UNK> is probably one of the best of the genre that doesn't have clint eastwood in it as johnny mark damon is a reasonably suitable stand in but without the <UNK> exterior carradine seemed to be a replacement for the obligatory lee van <UNK> character without being a total bad guy at first the identity exchange between carradine and johnny didn't seem to make sense but it all tied together by the time the film ended you knew each henchman would wind up getting his due <UNK> time for each was part of the anticipation br br in case you're wondering the title hero has nothing to do with the nick adams character from the classic tv western the rebel in this film johnny got his name from a <UNK> he had in <UNK> once br br perhaps the most unique element of the story had to do with the way it tied things up with the evil samantha who pulled the strings behind the scenes throughout after shooting carradine she beats a <UNK> <UNK> before johnny can get his revenge still alive it looks like carradine tries to shoot her and misses but it doesn't take long for johnny and <UNK> to track her into the <UNK> where she <UNK> without water carradine aimed for her <UNK>
<START> basically the exact same movie as house of wax vincent <UNK> first genuine horror hit released the previous year but seriously who cares because the mad magician offers just as many sheer thrills delightful period set pieces <UNK> 3 d effects sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor never change a winning team is exactly what writer <UNK> <UNK> must have thought when he penned down <UNK> character don <UNK> another tormented soul <UNK> by fate and out for vengeance against those who <UNK> him don <UNK> is about to perform his very first own <UNK> show as <UNK> the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history entitled the girl and the buzz saw <UNK> promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous <UNK> ross <UNK> appears on stage and <UNK> a contract under his nose stating that all of <UNK> <UNK> are the <UNK> property of the company the sleazy and relentless <UNK> who by the way also <UNK> <UNK> once beloved wife takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of <UNK> rival the great <UNK> inevitably <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but  also being a master of creating <UNK>  <UNK> his <UNK> image and even starts leading a double life the mad magician is an amusing and thoroughly <UNK> 50's horror movie in grand <UNK> style with a whole lot of <UNK> plot twists the <UNK> turns out a brilliant crime novelist and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross out moments although they obviously remain suggestive for most part the 3 d <UNK> near the beginning of the film like a <UNK> <UNK> player and a goofy trick with water <UNK> merely just serve as time filler and contemporary 50's hype but it's still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them the mad magician is also interesting from a <UNK> setting point of view as the events take place around the time <UNK> were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice <UNK> is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in like no other actor could ever accomplish price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually <UNK> further and further into mental madness in such an <UNK> mesmerizing way you pity don <UNK> yet at the same time you fear him enormously you support his vile acts of <UNK> and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death vincent price simply was a genius actor and in my humble opinion the <UNK> of the horror genre
<START> this movie was physically painful to sit through maybe because like many people my age and younger i grew up with dr seuss and loved his books funny clever whimsical and <UNK> at the same time the cat in the hat sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story and mike <UNK> performance as the cat is mostly <UNK> why the <UNK> belt accent the unfunny <UNK> the inappropriate jokes the <UNK> costume i had to go back and re read the books to see the real problem the books are simple this movie is overblown and way way too long br br you don't expect every kids' movie to be toy story or the iron giant but this one set a new low how could mike myers need the money
<START> mere thoughts of going overboard aka babes <UNK> make me want to <UNK> throwing yourself out a window would be better than watching this movie it's not even a supposed so bad it's good movie i would spend money to buy copies of this movie and burn them so that people can't see it oh the pain the pain
<START> fever pitch is a fun enough movie it has a lot of funny moments including a hilariously disturbing shower scene like most romantic comedies it has a dead zone in the middle where all the heavy she's breaking up with me stuff happens but other than that it continues to be funny until the end br br even though the plot revolves around <UNK> towards the red sox it's not <UNK> with sports you don't have to be a fan to enjoy this film br br of course that's easy for me to say i've been a red sox fan since i was a boy too br br 7 out of 10 br br <UNK>
<START> a nice <UNK> temple short child actors screaming their lines seemed to be the norm for that day and time perhaps being seen and not heard needed to be made up for aside from that this is fun given the films era there are certain aspects of the thing from a social viewpoint that strike me as both very <UNK> and liberal i won't go into those here i'd rather not spoil it for you but let you watch it for yourself and see if you spot those elements as early on as it was its easy to see from this short the fascination that was already developing for temple that makes it worth watching if you're a temple fan for others its a cool way to kill ten minutes while you're waiting for your good night glass of milk to warm up on the <UNK>
<START> intelligent stylish and compelling thriller from the great brian de palma is a modern classic that firmly ranks among his best films br br when troubled housewife is brutally murdered by a bizarre stranger the <UNK> son joins with a prostitute to <UNK> the killer br br dressed to kill left a strong impression upon the audiences of its day and for good reason de palma creates a wonderfully dramatic story that begins with an intriguing setup and builds into a harrowing mystery full of strong suspense the finale and conclusion are especially <UNK> it's a truly edge of your seat shocker even more impressive though is de palma's elegant direction that gives this film not only tight suspense but a unique and dark atmosphere of its own dressed to kill is also a very erotic film but mainly in a strangely beautiful way <UNK> <UNK> also lends a lovely musical score to the film br br the cast is another strong feature of this film michael cain does a terrific turn as a psychiatrist angie <UNK> is wonderful as the ill <UNK> housewife nancy allen's performance as an involved street walker is solid a young keith gordon also proves to be a worthy <UNK> as the investigating son br br many criticize de palma's films for having <UNK> elements and this film was no exception but any similarities between <UNK> works and de <UNK> can only be seen as a good quality as calling this film a <UNK> <UNK> would be <UNK> to a fine thriller dressed to kill is a must see for all cinema fans br br out of
<START> this movie is hilarious i watched it with my friend and we just had to see it again this movie is not for you movie goers who will only watch the films that are nominated for academy awards you know who you are i won't <UNK> it because you have seen that from all the other reviews br br whipped is a light hearted comedy that had me laughing throughout it doesn't take itself too seriously and should be watched with your friends not your girlfriend it won't win any awards but it just has to be watched to be appreciated true some of the jokes are toilet humor but that is not necessarily a bad thing everyone can use some of it sometimes some people need to <UNK> up and see whipped for what it is not what it isn't br br 1 4 out of
<START> although the <UNK> of someone focusing on this comment among the other 80 for this movie is low i feel that i have to say something about this one i am not the kind of movie watcher who pays attention to production value thought provoking dialog or brilliant acting directing however i claim that this movie sucks i don't know why i don't like it i mean it has almost everything i want out of a horror movie blood <UNK> unintentional humor etc according to this evidence it should be my favorite still zombi 3 is a <UNK> movie br br there are just too many things that <UNK> you to yell at the screen like when the girl leaves the army guy when their car breaks down to find water this <UNK> nothing so don't worry she walks into what i see as an abandoned hotel or something did she not see that there was a <UNK> lake in the middle of the building yes she's looking for water and passes up a lake why <UNK> she wants to know why the people who aren't there <UNK> the place is abandoned won't answer her when she calls out is anybody there oh this is just a little insignificant piece of the big picture i'm painting br br there is a reason though why i gave this film more than 1 star it's one of those movies where if you forget how bad it really is like i have a few times you'll want to watch it again because it's just so over the top in every aspect i called it blood in the first paragraph but this movie has no blood it has an ocean of gore also it has pretty weird creatures in it as well a zombie baby with an adult size hand and a magically flying head to name just two br br you know when you try to think of the worst and <UNK> movies ever made and you come up with <UNK> sci fi movies i believe that zombi 3 and movies like it should top those it has all the elements scientists arguing with the government <UNK> of the apocalypse on the radio <UNK> battling monsters and so on this is the plan 9 of the <UNK> while i won't say that this is a waste of money if you want to buy it just expect the very worst and when you find out that expecting the worst is <UNK> zombi 3 it won't be all that bad you might actually like it i'm not saying that's impossible br br don't think i hate this movie i don't really oh p s killing birds aka zombie 5 rules did i just blow my credibility
<START> given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings the girls in this film would be collecting gold silver and <UNK> at a <UNK> awards olympic ceremony a mentally disabled <UNK> would have made better choices than they did and would have screamed a lot less while doing so br br if you like films with a grainy picture deliberately amateur camera work my <UNK> year old grandmother <UNK> a camcorder with better results extremely poor sound and no discernible plot narrative then this is your ideal film also note that you should enjoy the following women screaming for no reason women whining for no reason in fact reason and logic don't appear much in this film for example we have to find stephanie yeah i can't believe i was speaking to her like last night she called you last night yeah she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one what how come she didn't tell me as in our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i have a problem with the fact that she didn't tell me she was going on a date br br okay so the budget is low that doesn't mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget the <UNK> is interesting since all with the exception of one tracks have been written and performed by the writers directors of the film itself in fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on <UNK> a track by the <UNK> a death metal band from sweden br br the most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel
<START> after coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes though i guess not if the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch with all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever though they couldn't they had to take all the same raunchy not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time they tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for while people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around it doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie <UNK> it's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either
<START> i saw this cinematic <UNK> in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 back when the tickets actually sold for 1 this is the only film i have ever walked out on with my friend while the idiocy that is the laser <UNK> 2000 sketch was on screen evidently my and my friend's reaction to the film was a common one it is not that i found the film offensive either as an 18 year old or now but rather that it is mind numbingly stupid and <UNK> unfunny devoid even of the <UNK> humor that makes a ed wood film watchable this is the real reason why nbc refused to air it rather than a failure to comprehend mr <UNK> vision unless of course his vision was to drive the film's <UNK> into <UNK> br br i remained surprised to this day that this film does not seem to have made any published 10 worst films of all time list it certainly makes mine you have been warned
<START> as this happens to be one of most favorite novels i was very excited to see the move i was not disappointed yes of course there are a few things that i could pick on but i think that the movie stuck true to the book and was a really good movie it seems that stephen king films mostly get a bad review but this is one of the good ones it is such a dark story which i guess is why i like it and what is better than the dead coming to life and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too if you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book it is a well written screen play the actors could have done a better job i only say this for rachel and <UNK> she was so <UNK> i liked everyone else a lot and most important to me it stuck true with the novel
<START> i rented this movie on dvd i knew that the movie wouldn't live up to what it promised me on the back of the case but once i saw that <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was in it i had to rent it it starts off pretty good with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable however the main character has nothing about her to make you feel sorry for her whatsoever and the end of the movie really leaves you hanging there are way too many unanswered questions there was a great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise but overall this is a very sub par movie but i guess it was worth the 3 99 rental <UNK>
<START> in the white balloon and <UNK> gold the two other films by <UNK> <UNK> that i've seen the director mines surprising amounts of depth in subjects that seem on the surface slight in <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> tribute to iranian women standing up for their rights i don't think he's as successful not that what he's saying isn't important of course and it's too bad that like pretty much every other <UNK> film <UNK> can't see it but after a while the film feels a tad flat and it feels long even at 90 minutes not saying i didn't like it though the actors are all fantastic and the celebration at the end of the film is <UNK> but it's not an important work in my opinion
<START> this movie probably never made a <UNK> on the radar screen but it's got quite a bit of quality it's pretty <UNK> yet you think it's only a movie duvall and close portray common people and you'd never even realize they are now big name actors it seems that the jerk in this story is a little too old to be chasing <UNK> girlfriend but i guess it's possible it seems unlikely that the kid would travel from montana to <UNK> by himself but i guess it's possible you might think that the family troubles in this movie would never happen in your own family but i guess it's possible i remember glenn close saying something like you think the work you do is the hardest part of your life but it isn't
<START> i must admit that i have been a sucker for samurai flicks since i can remember i used to watch rather <UNK> be it <UNK> works like the seven samurai or the bloody comic book variation like lone wolf and <UNK> i also liked us japanese <UNK> like the <UNK> blade and of course everything containing sonny chiba and <UNK> <UNK> and i've virtually watched every samurai at least twice but not <UNK> br br in 1993 i first watched <UNK> on video that even samurai films can be boring in the beginning i was looking forward to <UNK> reaching europe and the <UNK> that would come from that but by the time he actually reached spain i really didn't care so much for the movie anymore br br it wouldn't do the film justice to call it bad technically it's a clean entry into the genre but there is simply never quiet enough sho <UNK> has limited skills as both director and actor and has only a <UNK> of above mentioned japanese actors charisma and speaking of sho <UNK> son kane who appears in almost all sho <UNK> films as <UNK> son he has inherited little to none of his fathers limited acting skills adding to the minus points is the absence of the blood and gore that until then was a trademark of all samurai film this was obviously intended for a younger us european audience br br lets just say that it's a so so film for the average historic action adventure fan but a bore for hardened fans of samurai cinema fans who are into the samurai meets  genre should rather go and watch red sun 1971 featuring charles bronson as cowboy who has to team up with samurai <UNK> <UNK> to retrieve a samurai sword from bad guy alan <UNK> it pretty much how to do it right and where <UNK> went wrong br br so even though the film is a mere 100 minutes it seems like a much longer film br br the reason i gave this a <UNK> 4 10 points instead of 3 10 first time i saw this film i saw it in the german <UNK> version in this version <UNK> can actually be understood i must admit that his <UNK> is at times funny but gets tiresome after about 30 minutes
<START> there are 21 comments as i add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism this is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it br br it is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my 15 year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action to the humour and even to the beautiful music score br br i buy dvds only when i know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the uk i will certainly be adding it to my collection
<START> it's like hard to like describe just how like exciting it is like to make a relationship like drama like with all the like pornographic scenes thrown like in for like good measure like and to stir up like <UNK> like <UNK> and make us more like money and like stuff ellen the lost quote br br kissing like on the like mouth and stuff is like the best like artistic <UNK> like ever made watching like <UNK> hairy arms and like chris <UNK> was like the height of my years long movie viewing experience and stuff but before i like begin like breaking new u s 20 something <UNK> records with the my likes let me like just briefly list like the high like lights of this visual like feast br br 1 chris doing the deed with his <UNK> and not just that the way the camera guided so <UNK> by ellen and patrick <UNK> the viewer with a full screen shot of <UNK> fat white trash stomach after he finishes the un catholic deed that was truly thrilling i can in all honesty say that i've never seen such grace chris you should do more such scenes in your next movies because that is exactly what we needed as a <UNK> of what that brilliant brilliant man lars von trier and his idiots 95 started a quick w and then a hairy fat white belly what more can any movie goer ask for needless to say i can sit all day and watch chris <UNK> in spite of the fact that i'm straight such poetry in motion such <UNK> such style no less than total divine inspiration went into filming that sequence plus a solid amount of <UNK> philosophy even barbra streisand could not get any more spiritual than this br br 2 <UNK> hairy thick arms the <UNK> camera close ups so <UNK> photographed by our two directors of photography i can't emphasize this enough ellen and patrick often caused confusion regarding the proper <UNK> of the sex in question there were several scenes when we would see a part of a body a leg arm or foot yet it was often a guessing game does that body part belong to a man or a woman naturally chris and his fellow artists ellen patrick and <UNK> cast themselves on purpose because their bodies were ideal for creating this gender based confusion it was at times hard to guess whether one is seeing a female or male leg patrick is so very thin and <UNK> in his movements so <UNK> and <UNK> whereas ellen and the other girl are so very butch what with their thick legs and arms brilliant br br 3 brilliant especially the way that neatly ties in with the theme of role <UNK> between the <UNK> so utterly original and mind blowing ellen behaves like a man wants sex all the time while her ex patrick wants to talk like a girl <UNK> br br 4 <UNK> search for a <UNK> mate he must love 'the <UNK> which is quite <UNK> i am glad that the makers of this movie decided to break the long tradition of offering us intelligent <UNK> ellen is such a refreshing and realistic change the number of likes that she and her liberal friends manage to utter in less than 80 minutes is truly phenomenal 3 <UNK> to be exact they have managed to realistically transfer their real life <UNK> onto the big screen with a minimum of effort and i applaud them for that br br 5 the close ups of <UNK> plenty of stuff here for foot <UNK> which i think is a very liberal highly commendable way of reaching out to sexual <UNK> after all shoe and foot <UNK> are offered so little in modern cinema so it's nice to see that someone out there cares br br <UNK> or rather <UNK> offers more than meets the eye it is not just a modest little film about shallow people engaging in hollow relationships while <UNK> in meaningless conversations no it's much more than that it's about the light that <UNK> all silly creatures the <UNK> light that <UNK> the <UNK> lives of various pseudo artistic <UNK> who just dropped out of film school and plan to assault our senses with dim witted drivel that will hopefully play well at pretentious festivals like sundance and cannes <UNK> them to gain the necessary exposure hence some real cash for a change with which they will later hire the likes of sean penn and george clooney in promoting the saving of this planet and the <UNK> of all political problems this world faces what better way to do that than by making porn at the very start br br if chris and ellen did the camera here as is clearly stated in the end credits then who held the camera while the two of them were in front of it they probably hired some <UNK> by and shoved the camera into their hands br br go to http <UNK> com <UNK> and check out my tv cinema 150 worst cases of <UNK> list
<START> the french film <UNK> du <UNK> de la <UNK> directed by <UNK> film maker <UNK> <UNK> is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial writer michel <UNK> he has also worked on this film's scenario according to british cinema magazine sight and sound it is also known as whatever this film has been <UNK> as a breath of fresh air for french cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politics and its <UNK> on two stupid information technology workers the film is marred by its much too evident voice over which introduces us to the main character this makes us viewers feel as if we are watching a book that is bring read the basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to <UNK> sexual <UNK> is fine but the film goes out of hand once the hero starts <UNK> the misery faced by him and his friend instead of sticking to its main topic the film <UNK> in other directions leading to its downfall beware some women viewers might find not only the film but even its two heroes as moronic <UNK>
<START> i've read all the comments on this film i am a great admirer br br of the <UNK> <UNK> as such i read the book upon which this br br film was based the movie is an ugly and <UNK> <UNK> of the truth i do not criticize it for br br <UNK> small details or events for dramatic purposes it is br br not a documentary but the script changes the impact reaction br br realities and changes in every main character it vastly <UNK> br br the real relationship between <UNK> and the young <UNK> <UNK> br br from the ridiculous rivalry for a <UNK> woman which <UNK> br br the culture of <UNK> to <UNK> music box gift to <UNK> br br change of heart everything about this movie is false except br br for the amazing photography i understand that the shots of the br br <UNK> the palace were <UNK> out of <UNK> however br br changing a real story about the relationship between two people br br one of them very important to this world in order to build up a br br movie star is sad
<START> this movie is just plain terrible poor john savage had to <UNK> this low in order to be in another movie he stars as a rare type of vampire that is to help a lady that looks like a washed out and thrown in the streets hooker that is a dancer at a local strip club she <UNK> tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires as they get carried away making out on the floor of the dressing room savage is then assigned by a short leader of this rare vampire breed that looks like a cross between 80's punk rock and one of the olsen twins with purple hair this movie just gets all to crazy with savage <UNK> and dancing with a midget with a <UNK> spider on his head also one of the rare he quotes the elephant man and jimmy <UNK> and i just had to laugh this just gets <UNK> and then the most gross special effects that they could come up with is <UNK> throwing up her organs and pulling them out of her mouth and you can tell that that is all to fake her son doesn't know what to do with his <UNK> new identity and becomes more of a <UNK> than an object of <UNK> i enjoy a good vampire film believe me i do but i just hated this one even the photography stinks in and out <UNK> with the camera switching this way and that trying to make it look like the vampires move to fast for the camera to keep up and then the camera turns all to bright in the scene of savage chasing the son of <UNK> around till he <UNK> himself avoid this one
<START> i went into this movie perhaps a bit jaded by the hack and slash films rampant on the screen these days boy was i surprised this little treasure was pleasantly paced with a somber dark atmosphere more surprising yet was the very limited amount of blood actually shown as with most good movies this one leaves something to the imagination and bill paxton did a superb job at directing scenes shot inside the car as are well done and after watching the <UNK> of a scene episode at the end of the video tape it was good to see that some of the subtle yet wonderful things i had noticed were intentional and not just an oh that looks good keep it type of direction this is a moody movie filled with <UNK> still for the dark subject a considerable portion of it is filmed in daylight even some of the more disturbing scenes the acting is exceptional okay i've always been a fan of powers booth and never goes over the top <UNK> <UNK> it is very subdued which works extremely well for this type of film if there is any one area where this film lacks it is in the ending which seems just a bit too contrived but still works on a simpler level without destroying the mood or the message of the movie what is the message it's something that each individual decides for <UNK> overall on the 1 10 scale this movie scores an 8 for those who like the southern gothic genre ie body heat or midnight in the garden of good and evil and about a 5 for those who don't
<START> when i first heard about the show i heard a lot about it and it was getting some good reviews i watched the first episode of this <UNK> fairy tale as it so <UNK> itself and i really got hooked on it i have loved it since this show has a good sense of humour and it's fun to see a good show like this the cast is excellent as their characters and i wouldn't want to change them in any way br br for those unfamiliar with this show pushing daisies centers around a man named ned aka the pie maker played by lee pace who discovered a special gift when he was a boy he could bring the dead back to life with the touch of a finger he first did so with his dog <UNK> however there is the catch if he keeps a dead person alive for more than one minute someone else dies he learned this when he brought his mother back to life and his childhood <UNK> father died in <UNK> mother's place the other catch is if he touches the person again they're dead again but this time for good he learned this when his mother <UNK> him <UNK> his father took him to <UNK> school and when he left ned never saw his father again br br almost 20 years later ned owns a pie <UNK> cleverly titled the pie hole a co worker of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has a crush on ned but ned rejects her moves trying not to get close to anyone learning from past experiences private investigator <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> discovered the gift that ned has and decides to make him a partner in solving murders ned touches the victim asks who killed them and when the minute is up he touches them again and they solve it that's how they usually solve it throughout the episodes the murders have very interesting plots and be what people least expect br br one day ned discovers that his next murder to solve is his childhood sweetheart charlotte chuck charles anna <UNK> he brings her back to life and decides to break the rules and keep her alive in her place the funeral director who stole <UNK> from the corpses died when <UNK> finds out and when chuck wants to help with solving the murders he doesn't agree a bit for a while we hear him call chuck <UNK> <UNK> this is all kept in secret from <UNK> <UNK> aunts vivian and lily ellen greene and <UNK> <UNK> respectively and everyone else for that matter in case anyone recognized her from <UNK> the news etc vivian and lily <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> hadn't left the house in years <UNK> ned and chuck agree to work together ned and chuck grow to love each other though they can't touch each other ever again br br this show is funny has terrific characters contains great plot twists and will definitely get your spirits up i hope it doesn't get cancelled at 13 episodes
<START> as i write this review in 2008 we are <UNK> in a remake culture movie studios seem determined to ruin as many classic films as they can with thoroughly pointless <UNK> including <UNK> kong 'the wicker man' and practically every film that ever starred michael caine this lazy remake mentality is not a new phenomenon however as <UNK> for the do <UNK> proves an entirely pointless <UNK> version of bob <UNK> surreal masterpiece <UNK> in <UNK> <UNK> for the do <UNK> sucks the life out of the original by <UNK> colour all over <UNK> original footage and adding some lame new footage <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was an entirely <UNK> director to be <UNK> with <UNK> source material although in truth no director could hope to come close to <UNK> inspired insanity inevitably then <UNK> for the do <UNK> is nothing more than the <UNK> of a classic with an appalling new title attached for cartoon fans like myself its equivalent to a <UNK> of <UNK>
<START> in 1930 europe received quite a shock when luis <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> was released causing a riot in paris when screened there resulting in it being banned for something like over forty years three years later in 1933 when europe had gotten over the shock it was once again turned on it's ear with <UNK> a <UNK> of sorts to love the film starred a young unknown german actress named <UNK> <UNK> who would later change her name to hedy <UNK> when she moved to america to escape the madness of <UNK> hitler as eva a young bride who has just married a cold distant <UNK> husband played by <UNK> <UNK> only to discover that she has made a major mistake one divorce later eva is <UNK> fancy free is out one day skinny <UNK> in a lake when she discovers adam a handsome young engineer played by <UNK> <UNK> who takes a real fancy to her and she him after a wild night of passion <UNK> ex husband turns up once again hoping to win eva back only to find he now has a rival i won't spoil what <UNK> czech director <UNK> <UNK> who directed the original screen version of <UNK> <UNK> another <UNK> in romantic obsession directs from a screenplay by jacques <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> from the novel by robert <UNK> the film's <UNK> cinematography which reminded me of avant garde photographer man <UNK> photos of the era which goes for some <UNK> use of light shadow a lot is by hans <UNK> jan <UNK> the film's <UNK> editing is by <UNK> <UNK> the films art direction which goes for a lush nearly art <UNK> look is by <UNK> hes if i have any <UNK> about this film it is the music score by <UNK> <UNK> which goes for an over the top melodramatic feel to it that gets old fast certain themes are repeated over over again wearing out it's welcome fast kind of like some of david <UNK> over use of certain musical themes especially in <UNK> of <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> some years back a brand new restored print was made up of the best source material <UNK> together from various european existing <UNK> available <UNK> it to what is quite possibly the closest version of what it originally looked like before the <UNK> condemned it as <UNK> yeah right like the church never did anything wrong and the hayes office cut it to <UNK> when it was finally released in the u s a in 1936 in a hayes office <UNK> cut likewise minimal dialog in german with english subtitles it was meant to be a mainly visual experience not rated but contains that infamous nude skinny <UNK> scene by hedy <UNK> done <UNK> mind you some <UNK> of sexual content likewise that would <UNK> earn it a pg 13 rating nowadays worth a look if you have any interest in early european cinema or avant garde experimental cinema
<START> whoever says pokemon is stupid can die this movie is <UNK> i even <UNK> a tear when <UNK> died i don't cry much this film is a touching animated thriller br br in this fourth installment of pokemon ash and friends must stop the bad jerk from making <UNK> the ultimate evil weapon with his dark ball in the time sam and <UNK> travel through time and continuously are hunted by game hunters i like the part with the double battle and sam has the <UNK> <UNK> if you've played pokemon gold silver or crystal you know what it is br br i also enjoyed having <UNK> in charge instead of warner brothers putting the mini movie at the end was a great idea the pokemon in this movie come to life more than ever
<START> this is a film i saw when it first came out and which i have seen a few more times over the years it's always enjoyable br br one thing is that the comedy does not take sides it <UNK> labor and <UNK> equally only sid seems outside the classic struggle even though he's responsible for it br br spoiler warning do not read further if you haven't seen the film br br this is a fantasy though presented fairly <UNK> ask yourself could someone support most of his or her weight in a single <UNK> of fabric it would cut through almost any support br br also when <UNK> in an alley sid uses a garbage can cover like a <UNK> shield cute symbolism br br someday i'll get this on dvd
<START> some of the best movies that are <UNK> as comedies actually <UNK> between comedy and drama the graduate and butch cassidy and the sundance kid which were made also in the late 1960's are perfect examples are they comedies with dramatic undertones or dramas with a lot of humor in many respects the odd couple falls into this same category of being both comedy yet highly dramatic with deep <UNK> about human nature much of what happens may be funny to the audience but the characters are not laughing br br despite the rather light hearted tv show of the 1970's the original odd couple is not merely about a neat guy and messy guy who are forced to live together because of their marital situation it's really about two <UNK> who must face why their <UNK> fell apart and how their <UNK> <UNK> reveal themselves outside of their marriage <UNK> the characteristic of felix <UNK> jack <UNK> perfectly cast and <UNK> the characteristic of oscar madison walter matthau are only the beginning and somewhat superficial as the story unfolds we find there is a lot more to these men than simply <UNK> versus <UNK> br br briefly the story is really about felix <UNK> who has to face an impending divorce from his wife francis who we never meet but is an important character throughout the story on the verge of suicide <UNK> goes to the only place he knows the apartment of oscar madison where a group of poker buddies hang out every so often we learn that <UNK> is not only a member of this poker club but the group knows what's happening to him and try in their inept way to help out madison figures the best way to help <UNK> is to let him move in with him until his <UNK> <UNK> wear off br br unfortunately for madison he doesn't know what he's getting himself into madison is a <UNK> happy go lucky if rather irresponsible <UNK> who's <UNK> was last <UNK> probably when herbert hoover was still in the white house <UNK> idea of serving <UNK> is grabbing <UNK> cheese and sticking them in between two pieces of bread and then throwing the <UNK> of a bag of <UNK> on the table on the other hand he enjoys booze and women in short having a good time br br <UNK> is not only altogether different he is <UNK> opposite he is not only an obsessive <UNK> nut that finds more joy in <UNK> the apartment than meeting women but he knows more than most women do about cooking and fine eating at one point he calls his ex wife not to talk about <UNK> but to get her recipe for <UNK> at another moment <UNK> was going to spend the rest of the evening cutting <UNK> for <UNK> when madison seems <UNK> <UNK> finally <UNK> he was only doing it for his roommate because he can't stand <UNK> who is this guy but he has another endearing <UNK> felix is also a <UNK> he <UNK> about his health to the point where he makes strange noises in public places claiming he's helping his <UNK> he seems to have every health condition in the book and if they made up more felix would probably have them ultimately he is overly self absorbed br br running throughout the movie are references to marriage at one point when madison is trying to convince <UNK> to move in he says what do you want a wedding ring but little does he know that it is not the neat guy who can't deal with the messy guy but the other way around their friendship becomes an <UNK> <UNK> relationship and the climax occurs when oscar invites two lonely british sisters for a get together with both comedic and tragic results this is one of the best comedies of its type ever written and not to be missed with <UNK> performances by walter matthau and jack <UNK> in roles that are hard to imagine better played by anyone else it is unfortunate that writing of this caliber is sadly lacking from most comedies being produced today
<START> i've waited a long time to see dr <UNK> torture <UNK> and after i watched it i was really disappointed by it it's not the <UNK> film i expected it to be the trailer which i saw on a something weird dvd is much better than the entire film which is remarkably forgettable there are almost no stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is interesting but it doesn't even come close to other <UNK> <UNK> movies out there from fellini or <UNK> the characters are dull and there's almost nothing dramatic going on even though we see rape <UNK> insanity etc br br the main problem with dr <UNK> torture <UNK> was the fact that it was a talk a <UNK> more than anything else it was almost like watching a book i just wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something instead we see listen to the main characters <UNK> chat endlessly about dull stuff br br a missed opportunity
<START> i'm sorry but this is just awful i have told people about this film and some of the bad acting that is in it and they almost don't believe me there is nothing wrong with the idea modern day japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of <UNK> warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything when the troops first realise something strange is happening does every single person in the back of the transport need to say hey my watch has stopped imagine lines like that being repeated 15 times before they say anything else and you have the movie's lack of greatness in a nutshell
<START> the best that i can say about this film is that it was mildly amusing at times and that it was an adequate time killer unfortunately this film is also so annoying that i wanted to slap these characters around this is the kind of film that is so sweet it hurts your teeth the intentions were good i suppose but things get awfully tiresome when the dialogue is so nauseating when the two leads aren't together on screen this really isn't bad at all but be afraid during those frequent moments when the loving couple starts talking to one another
<START> where to begin how best to describe just how awful this movie is br br let's start with the campy <UNK> humor it isn't very funny add a bunch of musicians <UNK> actors meat <UNK> is horrible and deborah harry is even worse pity poor art <UNK> who should have known better than to do this movie br br and then there is the plot a <UNK> whose life goal is to work an alice cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a <UNK> for alice cooper at least they get what they want br br and then just when the movie should end they can't come up with a more plausible last scene than a well i won't ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie br br there are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a b movie or perhaps worse <UNK> <UNK> is one of them for me and he has a more prominent role that's a sure sign that the movie probably won't be very good if nothing else the movie lives up to the low expectations even <UNK> them by being worse than poor br br let's just say this this is the movie against which all bad movies are compared and none are worse than <UNK>
<START> this is an excellent stand up dvd eddie izzard is the funniest person i have seen in years his routine is hilarious and makes for great conversation with others who have seen it i highly recommend this one the part about the history of europe is a bit slow but the ending jokes in french are quite good because you don't have to speak french to get it although if you do it is still hilarious also the parts about being a <UNK> are quite good the first scene about san francisco is not great but funny the first time skip over those if you can it's almost not worth watching however this really is a funny funny stand up show that everyone should see i was dead at the time
<START> roman <UNK> <UNK> is my comment on the movie what else is there to say br br this character really brings out the moron in <UNK> a tough gangster with an inability to <UNK> <UNK> words well it seems that it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express <UNK> intelligently br br roman <UNK> will go down in the <UNK> of movie history as one of the greatest of all morons br br there is of course great comedy among the other characters michael keaton is f a h and so is joe <UNK> br br i just like the fact that <UNK> kept the movie from an r rating because he could not <UNK> profanity
<START> my friend and i picked paperhouse out of a random pile of movies on our weekly <UNK> to the horror section neither of us had heard of it but the <UNK> on the box was really promising and the movie didn't disappoint though i still probably wouldn't call it a horror movie exclusively br br 11 year old anna <UNK> draws a house and visits it in her dreams she is definitely asleep when she's seeing the house but it's so real in a sense that it's almost like a completely separate reality which in view of later events doesn't seem like a far cry from the truth anyhow she finds she can add to the house its <UNK> and its surroundings by simply adding to the picture br br while this is going on anna is getting increasingly more ill with a fever and besides that is getting totally obsessed with the house and her drawing on top of that she and her mother are also dealing with her absent father he has a job that takes him away for long stretches though one gets the impression there's actually more to the story than that br br ok so the drawing stuff sounds nice enough but frankly there's something really menacing about it the <UNK> is <UNK> surreal the house for instance is just a grey block in the middle of a desolate field the folks who made the movie did a great job of making us very uncomfortable with this alternate world ongoing dream br br one of the things anna adds to the house is a boy mark who seems to be the same patient her doctor keeps talking about i'm not giving that away you know from the moment he appears that it's the same kid in reality mark can't walk due to an illness in <UNK> drawing world he can't walk because she didn't draw him any legs she blames herself for his real life illness and tries to <UNK> the situation but everything starts getting really weird she even brings her absent father into the drawing with disastrous results the bits with the father are really terrifying br br i don't want to give anything away so i'll stop there there seems to be a lot going on in this film i'm sure you'll have a ball <UNK> this thing do death with your pals after you watch it is it a simple a story as it seems or are there actually layers of meaning i don't know but either way it's quite fascinating there was a nightmare on elm street ish quality about it in that at a certain point reality and dreams <UNK> i love things like that br br my only complaint is that it feels like it could have ended many times but didn't i'm satisfied with the ending it had some of you sensitive types might want to have <UNK> handy though it really could have a variety of conclusions anyway it doesn't exactly feel drawn out once it's actually over but while you're watching and it keeps <UNK> back in it's a little nerve <UNK> br br still paperhouse is a really good film it's well done and acting especially charlotte burke as anna is top notch burke who has never before or since appeared in a film is a real gem i don't know why she never went onto do anything else but either way she's really convincing and enjoyable to watch br br paperhouse isn't exactly a horror movie it's sort of a fantasy suspense something else type of movie with some definite <UNK> moments but you can still watch it with your family and not be worried that your little brother or grandmother will get <UNK> out by blood <UNK> or something br br give it a chance you won't regret it and maybe you should read the book too
<START> brazilian films often get more positive <UNK> than they actually deserve rather incredibly <UNK> <UNK> against everybody original title which the producers <UNK> god against everybody got very low <UNK> grade point average in this website it seems to be <UNK> rejected by female <UNK> at large actually it is not so brutal i mean as far as <UNK> violence is concerned its brutality is <UNK> as it portrays would be <UNK> i mean underdog citizens who in fact possess high tech equipment who <UNK> perform murder orders in exchange of <UNK> <UNK> is this post modern man is his her only worry a quick almost <UNK> ultra <UNK> lay amidst over <UNK> <UNK> the picture is probably the best brazilian film of 2004 so far its shining editing style <UNK> la godard its curious soundtrack <UNK> its more than efficient overall cast and above all its original narration with subtle non <UNK> hidden points that only come to light in the <UNK> deserve at least an 8 mark
<START> i gave this film an 10 10 with some <UNK> as it's hard to praise something that so haunted and terrified me for years the sheer menace on the woman in <UNK> face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just <UNK> the dread br br i saw this when it was first on tv when i was 10 and it really did <UNK> me for years i'm fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too so many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be but you can believe all those who have posted on this board this really is incredibly powerful stuff i mean i really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not but this really is menacing and will probably <UNK> most people i haven't seen it since i was 10 and i'm tempted to watch it again but fear i might have some <UNK> nights i can't quite put my finger on what it is exactly but i think it's something to do with the fact that fear is the woman's greatest weapon and that we as viewers are just as <UNK> as we feel the fear so intensely it's remarkable that other <UNK> feelings are so <UNK> br br i've also seen the stage play which was an excellent production but nothing can compare to this
<START> this film is absolutely awful but nevertheless it can be hilarious at times although this humor is entirely unintentional br br the plot was beyond ridiculous i don't even think a 2 year old would be convinced by the ludicrous idiocy that the film makers tried to slap together into a story however on the positive side some of the <UNK> inane plot twists provide a great deal of humor for example wow lady <UNK> has a giant missile hidden in her back yard it gets worse and even funnier but i'll spare you br br the acting is generally laughable most of the kids' roles are sort of cute but not very believable on the other hand annie is pretty awful all around the adults don't take their roles seriously at all but this is largely a good thing if they'd tried to be believable the film would've been even worse which is difficult to imagine br br once you get past the overall <UNK> of the movie there are actually a few standout moments of almost not <UNK> the scene where lady <UNK> son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious though it's an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police the butler character while very minor is a ray of <UNK> that almost but never quite <UNK> through the <UNK> br br watching this movie actually caused me physical pain nevertheless there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without beginning to <UNK> <UNK> judged on its good parts alone the movie would be about a 5 unfortunately the rest of the movie hardly deserves a 1 thus i give it a 3 br br that's being pretty generous i'd say
<START> i've been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too some of the users are stuck in a <UNK> type of mentality this film was meant to be a <UNK> a <UNK> <UNK> fun film it was never meant to be <UNK> or serious it was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone i knew when it came out even though it <UNK> the tragedy of the <UNK> explosion i was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed this one my young son loved it too later i shared it with my daughter and she too loved it <UNK> is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that fun all the <UNK> in the world should <UNK> up or stick to watching documentaries or <UNK> and avoid any other type of film so sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real <UNK> one in <UNK> and one at <UNK> <UNK> in california they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt <UNK> i guess their parents didn't explain the difference between fantasy and reality oh well if you love fantasy fun films and haven't seen this one i highly recommend it enjoy
<START> this movie is brilliant the comments made before is from someone who obviously doesn't get it the movie is campy yes but it is uplifting and fun this movie is an underground hit and brings comparisons to absolutely fabulous it is a must see
<START> anton <UNK> makes the film and he is the main subject watching him knock up a song if not a whole album quickly showed the guy to be a real talent he thinks he is god but is so <UNK> and interesting the <UNK> are not really that interesting in comparison <UNK> or otherwise hey do you <UNK> a drivers license anton says to the cameraman well lets go <UNK> this guitar great use of archive home video material great to see rock <UNK> still being made a cool doc about the creative process if you like this go see <UNK> live tonight sold out on dvd a good experience anton is this film 8 out of 10
<START> <UNK> doesn't make a very convincing alan <UNK> compared to stewart granger which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the <UNK> <UNK> the <UNK> prisoner of <UNK> and the 1950 king <UNK> mines patrick <UNK> fails utterly even the portrayal of an older alan <UNK> by sean connery in league of extraordinary gentlemen was very good in an otherwise big flop also alison <UNK> lacks the grace of deborah kerr in the role of the leading lady and last but not least the impressive <UNK> in the role of <UNK> makes it very hard for anyone to fill his shoes for someone who was disappointed by richard <UNK> 1985 version i now highly recommend it if you can't get your hand on the granger version
<START> in the future of 1985 a <UNK> <UNK> headed by howard <UNK> is holding <UNK> on tv's first <UNK> network they <UNK> it's programming that play as a series of skits i can name the good <UNK> movies on one hand not using my thumb amazon women on the moon kentucky fried movie the meaning of life and mr <UNK> <UNK> video notice how i didn't mention tunnel vision the reason for that is that this <UNK> is death in cinematic form none of the skits are even remotely funny or even the least bit clever it takes some sort of great <UNK> on the film <UNK> part to not even get one laugh out of me br br my grade f br br eye candy <UNK> <UNK> goes full frontal
<START> this has got to be one of the worst movies i've ever seen there were people leaving the theatre others were falling asleep ok it was a late night show this is a no sense movie one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again i would love to watch the making off of this movie as i am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such garbage do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think they're doing something interesting i wonder the soundtrack is awful apart from some <UNK> stuff that reminds you of a previous <UNK> album even if you're a fan of <UNK> music stay home it's the best thing to do the little tiny pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this torture god
<START> if asked how i would define the word shallow i would <UNK> watch a jerry bruckheimer production if asked how i would define the phrase wasted potential i would <UNK> watch a jerry bruckheimer production bruckheimer productions are nearly always sure fire hits at the box office but nearly always receive critical <UNK> from the critics off the top of my head i can only think of an officer and a gentleman and black <UNK> down getting a lot of critical acclaim br br <UNK> tide too received some <UNK> acclaim from critics it s certainly one of bruckheimer s better films which alas <UNK> t saying much the problem i had is the scenario that sets up the story the russians are fighting the <UNK> and the conflict <UNK> through the whole of russia leading to an ultra <UNK> russian to take over a nuclear missile base and <UNK> the west if they <UNK> maybe the ending of the cold war had everything to do with it but i found this set up very unconvincing it s not helped by some errors in <UNK> like the french <UNK> <UNK> being in the <UNK> <UNK> t the <UNK> be better <UNK> in the black sea or that the <UNK> <UNK> consists of <UNK> footage featuring conflicts from the <UNK> the first <UNK> war and even vietnam once again the <UNK> very unconvincing <UNK> into my mind the story does improve somewhat when the story proper a battle of <UNK> concerning orders between a nuclear submarine commander and his number two gets <UNK> director tony scott does his best as do the cast but the problem still lies in an unconvincing scenario the worst thing is that if this had been made in the mid 1980s when <UNK> was a real possibility <UNK> <UNK> this film would have terrified me but after the cold war ended so had the dangers of nuclear war which means <UNK> tide has little impact
<START> having developed a critical eye for film and a love for good cinema i went to see antwone fisher with my breath <UNK> held while i am an <UNK> fan of denzel washington both of his skill as an actor and of his public persona i am an honest enough fan to admit the very few times when he hasn't quite hit the mark in a film or two and i could be wrong about those after all i am not an actor but this was different denzel would pour his <UNK> experience into and guide a film handling one of the most sensitive topics known to man the abuse of a child as his directorial debut no less and develop the film to point that it would successfully present the triumph of a man i didn't want to be disappointed br br and i wasn't br br what i did see is a film full of promise that connected diverse audiences and gave the inexperienced viewer a brief but truthful eye into the life of a young man whose childhood was a living hell but who <UNK> despite it all this film did it and <UNK> a dry eye of any color in the theatre proved it it takes someone to know the topics in this film to know when truth is presented it takes a talented filmmaker to tell you the story convincingly when you haven't experienced it and if he can further draw an audience in and cause an audience to emotionally respond without pity the filmmaker has done his job in any film black white purple or <UNK> <UNK> that is what makes good cinema bravo denzel washington derek luke joy <UNK> and most of all antwone fisher you have indeed won
<START> another wonderful <UNK> book made into an incredibly awful movie if the big budget movies don't work then why make a low budget made for t v movie that's 10 times worse i am desperate for a good movie that will do one of his books justice
<START> ok there are people who should not see this movie br br 1 don't see it if you don't like satire or black humour 2 don't like it if you got offended by the <UNK> 3 don't see it if you want a serious superhero movie br br the rest of you run don't walk to see mystery men it's funny it's quirky it's a delightful <UNK> of every bad superhero cliche known to man occasional <UNK> into junior high humour don't ruin the tongue in cheek low key fun of <UNK> <UNK> ben stiller and hank <UNK> as well as a couple of amusing smaller parts by geoffrey rush and greg kinnear good to see louise <UNK> getting work too i laughed all the way through utterly <UNK> somewhat weird but good
<START> this movie sucked it really was a waste of my life the acting was atrocious the plot completely implausible long long story short these people get <UNK> by this pathetic crazed killer but completely fail to fight back in any manner and this is after they take a raft on a camping trip with no gear and show up at a <UNK> that is already assembled and completely <UNK> with food and clothes and the daughters <UNK> additionally after their boat goes missing they panic that they're stuck in the woods but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just <UNK> out of the woods like he did to get to them like i said this movie sucks a complete joke don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it
<START> the second coming of suzanne is yet another one of those <UNK> films that tries to come across as extremely sophisticated yet all it does is put the viewer to sleep like other movies of this type there is limited dialogue everyone is much more interested in the visual aesthetic of the shot however the cinematography stinks so there is nothing at all to keep your attention br br the video box states that this film is one of the most exciting visual adventures ever seen on film yeah sure it's right up there with watching such stimulating events as a bucket of ice melting or a turtle walking for a mile 1 10
<START> this is a fantasy movie for kids based on the <UNK> creek legend although i don't know why they called it return to <UNK> creek as if it's a sequel this movie has nothing to do with the documentary and its fantasy kiddie fare dawn wells stars as the mother of 3 children who get lost in the swamp around <UNK> creek with 2 other men and the monster comes to their aid yes it's very silly and the plot is corny but this kind of movie is perfect for the 8 12 y o group which it targeted it's harmless g rated kiddie fare and at least you don't have to worry about leaving your kids alone while they watch it strictly for the 8 12 y o set older kids will get bored and think it lame
<START> <UNK> i could not agree more my girlfriend is watching this at this very moment and i find this movie appalling quote from my chinese girlfriend laughing they are doing all this for a man br br i find these women have no intensity no sense of the a fight between tragedy and identity and that these men are hardly worth fighting for during the dance scene where zhang <UNK> <UNK> wins them over the men look stupid more than <UNK> br br japanese people have much more intensity than chinese people and being geisha is japanese culture i am sure the chinese had something similar but the faces do not match the main br br anyway the dialogue is so <UNK> so american had a european done it with european <UNK> they would have done a far better job br br i have to add it seems most of the people who liked the film are american sorry to say but no wonder all <UNK> out for you not <UNK> not passionate i think the chinese actresses are lovely but i could not say they were good actors in this film yes the cinematography is great but really i cannot see how it can be seen that these characters are complex deep individuals br br i'm going to japan to see the real thing i am sure that would be amazing to see
<START> i saw switching goals twice and always the same feeling you see the olsen twins make same movie they like play different sports and then fall in love to boys ok now about the movie first off all such little boys and girls don't play on such big goals 2 football does not play on time outs 3 if the game is at its end the <UNK> gives some <UNK> a minute or more and the finish is so <UNK> i think that this movie is bad because of the lack of football <UNK> if it were done by european producers it would be better and also the <UNK> actors aren't the wright choice they suffer from lack of authentic ok they played some seasons in full house but that doesn't make them big stars you have got to show your talent and that is what is missing in the olsen twins
<START> good western filmed in the rocky arizona <UNK> lots of tough guys throughout <UNK> character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type several holes appeared in the picture but not enough to <UNK> it being exciting and worth seeing one really dumb scene shows heston <UNK> 45 cases of their <UNK> and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire a to gather that much <UNK> he would have needed a pack <UNK> to carry the <UNK> b the grass was obviously dry why not just drop a match on it and let <UNK> rip
<START> william s hart as jim <UNK> the most <UNK> bachelor in canyon city is finally getting <UNK> to pretty blonde waitress <UNK> <UNK> as molly stewart his fiancée doesn't know it but mr hart is secretly the western town's most wanted <UNK> however hart is planning to go straight due to his marriage plans unfortunately ms <UNK> discovers <UNK> secret <UNK> whilst cleaning up his <UNK> cabin so she calls off the wedding next <UNK> <UNK> to the charms of mining <UNK> frank <UNK> as w sloane carey br br <UNK> entertainment from superstar hart he was <UNK> no less than 1 at the box office by <UNK> <UNK> for the years <UNK> and <UNK> ahead of mary pickford the principles perform <UNK> later on frank <UNK> was quite a director and <UNK> <UNK> a suicide br br a knight of the <UNK> 8 20 15 william s hart william s hart <UNK> <UNK> frank <UNK>
<START> it's not really about <UNK> <UNK> out the occasional training montages and it could just as easily be about <UNK> or <UNK> or a <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> instead like every other rocky <UNK> derivative that <UNK> the 80s market it's about <UNK> <UNK> with stick to it <UNK> rendering all social personal realities irrelevant by your <UNK> with love interest standing by of course ronald reagan top to bottom in short so as a piece of cinema it's down to the details some of the actors are quirky enough to <UNK> things up especially the love interest brought to you by none other than mr keanu reeves warming up for ted heroine olivia <UNK> hateful <UNK> dad and big hair <UNK> are more interesting than the <UNK> mom or her utterly <UNK> bitch <UNK> <UNK> one of whom appears to be made of <UNK> it's my instinct to be appalled by the comic relief black guys but on the other hand at least they're in the movie but <UNK> doesn't quite convince with her awkward girl <UNK> and in the absence of any other narrative focus the lack of interest in the <UNK> themselves really does matter it's all just bodies <UNK> around and not only is the outcome of the big <UNK> a <UNK> conclusion it's all performed by an obvious double
<START> this is a classic stinker with a big named cast mostly <UNK> who were well past their prime and <UNK> in this one br br this is quite a depressing film when you think about it remain on earth and you will face illness and eventually your demise br br <UNK> <UNK> showed that she could still dance too bad the movie didn't concentrate more on that maureen <UNK> looking <UNK> still displayed those steps from queen of the star dust ballroom so much more down to earth from 10 years earlier br br i only hope that this film doesn't encourage <UNK> to commit mass suicide on the level of jim jones how can anyone be idiotic enough to like this and say it gets you to think br br why did don <UNK> win an oscar for this nonsense br br if the <UNK> were doing such a wonderful thing at the end why was the <UNK> encouraged to get off the boat why did steve <UNK> jump ship as well after all he had found his lady love br br this would have been a nice film if the <UNK> had just managed to find their <UNK> of youth on earth and stay there br br sadly with the exception of <UNK> <UNK> at this writing <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and lord knows who else are all gone the writers should have taken the screenplay and placed it with this group as well
<START> nope i am just not going to get with it here i refuse to go along with the program don't you supposed that perhaps this movie is just a tad over rated look at the reader comments and their star ratings most are 6 10 7 10 or better i think this is an instance when the ratings may say more about the people rendering them than the movie itself which is unique how many other sex fantasies about <UNK> <UNK> complete with horse <UNK> have become mainstream hits as <UNK> dvd titles i watched this movie with a <UNK> sense of anticipation expecting fireworks and instead got someone popping a <UNK> shopping bag it looked great but once the thrill had been spent even the twist ending didn't do much to save it br br the film's background story says it all director films about 25 minutes of borderline hardcore fake <UNK> sex for another movie is informed the footage will not be appropriate sets it aside waits two or three years for a <UNK> of critical acclaim to build up then <UNK> an entire feature around that 25 minutes filming roughly 70 minutes of otherwise unrelated excruciatingly boring footage and <UNK> the 25 minute <UNK> in as a dream sequence that the 25 minutes of film in question is strikingly odd original and shocking in a deliberate <UNK> manner goes without saying but we aren't here to <UNK> that 25 minutes alone we must consider the entire film and ask ourselves why people are so enthusiastic about the movie or are they just <UNK> by it's background story and history of having been banned by people who were stupid enough to be offended by it br br perhaps it is an anti <UNK> agenda that appeals to them hating the western <UNK> of <UNK> and christianity is one of the few remaining socially acceptable <UNK> of <UNK> just today it was revealed that the bbc <UNK> <UNK> their <UNK> with anti christian anti western sentiment in the <UNK> of political correctness you can say anything you want about the bible <UNK> priests the <UNK> cruelty of the church and how much white men and their <UNK> <UNK> suck the <UNK> skin off a golf ball but say one negative thing about non <UNK> <UNK> and you are <UNK> this movie was <UNK> made for such a sentiment with a <UNK> old <UNK> up priest who has an entirely <UNK> on screen relationship with two pretty 14 year old french boys complete with inappropriate touching <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> br br and then there is the horse <UNK> photographed in such <UNK> <UNK> detail that portions of the film could be used as visual aids for a <UNK> class on animal <UNK> yes i understand the <UNK> relevance of the imagery large animal <UNK> with a wealth of <UNK> <UNK> just waiting to be unleashed like fire <UNK> but if i wanted to watch horses you know do it i would like go live on a farm having their <UNK> in my face is about as entertaining as watching someone use a bathroom br br is this movie just a sort of artsy <UNK> for social <UNK> probably though i will grant the artistic execution of most of it filmed in a kind of arty euro detail that even has a <UNK> forest pond right out of a <UNK> painting complete with a <UNK> <UNK> bridge and the ending which even i managed to be surprised by does sort of wrap it all up into a neat if <UNK> package but you have to remember that there are certain things that cannot be <UNK> for their design elements and many artists are guilty for <UNK> them in their work to lend a sort of <UNK> that would not have been achieved without it that isn't fair and even clint eastwood has fallen prey to the urge with his new movie about <UNK> <UNK> whether or not his film is any good stands as a separate consideration from whether or not that battle was a noble cause fought by men who were heroes the problem is that most people will not be able to separate out the two aspects of the movie and will be <UNK> up to give it oscars because of it's noble message not because it is a particularly good or original movie br br while it may seem like an odd parallel i see one with the beast how can anyone not see the basic beauty of nature in the sight of two horses <UNK> and who cannot see the logical <UNK> of the repressed sexuality from fairy tales in the film's explosive set piece where beauty and the beast finally do the nasty somehow i managed to miss both points and am delighted that i have seen this film so that i can trash it as being what it really is 25 minutes or so of eye opening over the top adult fairy tale imagery surrounded by 70 minutes of skull <UNK> boring artsy <UNK> euro trash dreck about some guy getting a <UNK> and a great ending it's art for sure but it sucks hard br br 3 10
<START> i am <UNK> this as a spoiler only because of some of my comments of the show's content not to the content itself br br as i read the comments it is apparent that those <UNK> somehow tolerate the show but disdain it while the <UNK> seems to <UNK> in its so called <UNK> one reader even so it seems actually <UNK> that he believes these events did or could have happened when bush was in grade school br br but as to the content as i see it trying to be neutral is that the group that made this series must actually be really bush <UNK> in the episode that i saw last <UNK> it showed that the program must have been put together long before <UNK> became the front runner for the nomination because the other former front <UNK> are all featured br br another thing that caught my attention was the use of add in <UNK> i thought that the series must have been made in europe of for sure not in the u s a because i know of no home the u s a that does not have built in <UNK> and most likely in the homes of the artists br br as i watch the show yes i do get caught up in it i am amazed to see what must be a terrific desire of the writers to do what they can to embarrass our president sure there are problems as most american will agree but that is no reason to be so hateful in public displays seen around the world perhaps the trend has now been set by this show and network so that if <UNK> or <UNK> got in would they continue to produce and air the same sort of humor about them br br just one more comment on a <UNK> remarks if there had been some sort of change in the election back in 2000 according to that writer he was so sure that there would be a completely different acceptable president wow <UNK> thinking on his part as far as <UNK> events i do believe that it was set in motion back when <UNK> was president and i can't see how if gore was president anything would be much different
<START> when i saw the preview i thought this is going to be a great movie and indeed it could have been the actress playing the main character was very credible and the beauty of the filming is <UNK> however the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture the level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in <UNK> and it took away most of the magic of the film however i must <UNK> the <UNK> because the english sub titles were more <UNK> and appropriate that the original french <UNK> and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the <UNK>
<START> this is the neil simon piece of work that got a lot of <UNK> the odd couple is a one of a kind gem that <UNK> within you got felix <UNK> jack lemmon a <UNK> <UNK> neat freak and a big thorn in the side of his roommate oscar madison walter matthau a total <UNK> these men have great jobs though felix is a news writer and oscar is a sports writer both of these men are divorced <UNK> wife is nearby while <UNK> is on the other side of the u s the west coast well what can you say two men living in one roof together without driving each other crazy is impossible as well as improbable it's a whole lot of laughs and a whole lot of fun i liked the part where when those two british neighbors that speak to both gentlemen and after oscar kicked out felix he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night earlier it's about time that felix needed to <UNK> up i guess all neat freaks neat to <UNK> up they can be <UNK> yet they should be patient as well a very fun movie and a <UNK> classic neil simon's the odd couple is a must see classic movie 5 stars
<START> wrapped in gorgeous english country backgrounds emma is a delicious <UNK> to be <UNK> for dreamy <UNK> br br emma gwyneth paltrow is a <UNK> intelligent young woman who has just married off her <UNK> and <UNK> to a marriage which emma takes the credit in <UNK> eager to use her talent in <UNK> things for the people around her she decides to match the <UNK> mr <UNK> alan <UNK> with her pretty young friend harriet toni collette br br the result is a series of mixed <UNK> and mistaken interpretations that end up <UNK> themselves out with emma learning that she did not have as much control over events as she thought br br the film is full of jane <UNK> witty and <UNK> characterizations gwyneth paltrow is at her best portraying this maiden of a restrained polite society with wit and ease her growing romance with the <UNK> mr knightley jeremy northam is the heart of this film mr knightley is one of the greatest romantic leading men in films he is incredibly handsome in a modest relaxed way that is irresistible he is certainly well matched to gwyneth paltrow their charming friendship that began when he was 16 and she was an <UNK> has <UNK> as he a family friend matches wits with her in an older <UNK> fashion that grows into something more with a <UNK> look or understated <UNK> at emma <UNK> knightley is a delight to watch br br other wonderful characterizations include the comic juliet stevenson greta <UNK> ewan <UNK> polly walker and the <UNK> <UNK> miss bates who is very funny br br seeming shorter and more flowing than most jane austin adaptations emma has comic rhythm that promises true enjoyment
<START> a cast of 1980's tv movie and tv series guest stars misty <UNK> pamela <UNK> <UNK> little seymour <UNK> among several others in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications br br over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an r rating but not enough good material to <UNK> any real interest this is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel <UNK> the alternate name of <UNK> i really can't see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there i also have to comment that this film is filled with smoking to the point that it becomes laughable when anyone lights up
<START> slow and nice images changed one another with sometimes annoying music you know <UNK> in background for the first 75 of the movie if you did not have enough sleep that's a good time br br but in the last 20 of the movie director decides to bring idea of re birth re incarnation or else through s m images spiritual lovers are cutting each others bodies with knives for me it was very much disturbing and actually changed general impression of blend of abstract art and images of modern japanese mystery br br <UNK> and director are great but weird br br did not enjoy it at all
<START> i don't think i could have enjoyed it more though certain things were disturbing i'm not going to say what if you haven't seen it you'll have to find out for yourself at any rate what movie can lack with robert downey jr 's puppy dog eyes all in all the plot was developed <UNK> nothing seemed too rushed as movies like this tend to be the characters were like able and there were plenty of hilarious scenes in it the idea over all is that the story is very well tied together even if certain aspects may be <UNK> by matter of opinion but like i said before it's hard not to love any movie with robert downey jr
<START> i must admit i'm a little surprised and disappointed at some of the very negative comments this film seems to <UNK> i think its a great horror sci fi film colonel steve west alex <UNK> returns to earth after an historical space flight to <UNK> while in space he <UNK> some bizarre and unknown disease he wakes up in a hospital bed he looks in a mirror and before his very eyes his face is melting escaping the <UNK> <UNK> he hides out in some local woods surrounding a small town unfortunately he starts to develop a rapidly growing <UNK> that can only be satisfied by eating other people he must feed on human flesh and drink the blood of others to survive stalking human prey he begins his reign of terror its up to his old friend dr ted nelson <UNK> <UNK> to find him and try and help him he has to work alone as his boss general perry <UNK> <UNK> wants it kept ultra quiet nelson can't even tell his wife judy ann <UNK> however sheriff blake micheal <UNK> becomes suspicious as general perry turns up just as some of the local <UNK> start turning up half eaten i don't really understand why this film gets such negative reviews what do people expect anyway i really like this film the star of the film are <UNK> rick <UNK> special make up and gore effects which for the most part are excellent and the fact their all <UNK> effects and no rubbish horrible cgi makes them even better writer and director william <UNK> isn't afraid to use them either we get some nice long lingering close up shots of the incredible melting man and they hold up very well even now photography music and direction are a little bit dull but professional enough the script manages to create some sympathy for the the monster shots of him looking <UNK> into ted <UNK> house or when he sees his own reflection in some water and <UNK> violently the ending set in a large factory of some sort is pretty downbeat so don't expect any happy ending which surprised me also the script doesn't really do anything with the premise he just walks around melting and killing with his friend trying to stop him maybe a bit too simple personally i think the worst bit of the film is near the start when the fat nurse runs down a hospital <UNK> in slow motion her screams are also portrayed in slow motion too it looks and sounds totally ridiculous you need to see it to believe it i like this film a lot and recommend it to 70's and 80's horror sci fi fans a bit of a favourite of mine
<START> after watching about half of this movie i noticed something peculiar i found myself constantly switching through tv channels to see what else is on not exactly a good movie <UNK> br br this movie is listed as being in a number of genres and i must say it mostly failed <UNK> in every one of them 80 through the movie i switched over to watch an old <UNK> instead bottom line the whole movie felt as if the ones making it didn't exactly know what to make and ended up in a <UNK> with no <UNK> taste
<START> s i c k really stands for so incredibly crappy i killed myself there was absolutely no acting to speak of the best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box the <UNK> of this movie was sufficient the filming was sub <UNK> street the production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits the props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store the ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh if there is a book out there for this movie i'm sure it's better i would avoid this at all costs i did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it just kidding
<START> coming from the same director who'd done <UNK> and immortal beloved i'm not surprised it's a good film ironically <UNK> is a movie i'd never heard of until now yet it must be one of the best movies of the late 80s partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades not talking about iranian or swedish cinema here the acting is not brilliant but merely solid unlike what some people here claim they must have <UNK> this wondrous acting much like anna the story is an interesting fantasy that doesn't end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly these unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose leaving it up to the <UNK> interpretation and there's nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this <UNK> is a somewhat unusual mix of kids' film and horror with effective use of sounds and music i like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie cliché ultra shy but secretly brilliant social <UNK> girl but a regular normal kid very refreshing i am sick and tired of writers <UNK> their own <UNK> like <UNK> into their books and onto the screens as if anyone cares anymore to watch or read about yet another <UNK> lonely childhood as if that's all there is or as if that kind of character background holds a <UNK> on good potential the scene with anna and the boy <UNK> for quite a stretch was a bit much <UNK> feelings of both vague disgust and amusement considering that she was supposed to be only 11 but predictably it turned out that burke was 13 or 14 when this was filmed i have no idea why they didn't <UNK> the character's age or get a younger actress it was quite obvious that burke isn't that young why directors always cast kids older than what they play hence <UNK> the realism i'll never know
<START> featuring a few of <UNK> all stars this highly effective slice of british horror revolves around a house and the <UNK> of it's previous <UNK> whose stories are all told to a scotland yard detective in search of a missing actor br br story number one which is probably the least impressive of the four deals with a writer and his wife who've just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels he creates a demented character named dominic who's a very creepy looking <UNK> and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this <UNK> looking man everywhere he goes after his wife convinces him to seek psychiatric help a sub plot is introduced which frankly didn't really work for me i won't spoil it for you br br the next story the best in my opinion stars the wonderful peter cushing as philip grayson a man who's moved into the home for his retirement years and soon makes his way to a nearby wax museum that deals in the macabre where he's very <UNK> to find a wax figure that looks exactly like a woman from his past soon thereafter an old friend who also has a history with this woman is in town for business and drops by to see him the two men are in for a rude awakening as they soon discover that there was more to this woman than meets the eye br br story three stars one of my very favorites christopher lee who plays john reid after moving into the home with his peculiar daughter jane the <UNK> that he hires becomes awfully suspicious as to the way reid <UNK> his daughter well come to find out if she knew what lee did she would have certainly understood br br the final story is a rather light hearted vampire tale that stars john pertwee and ingrid pitt after buying a cloak from a mysterious <UNK> actor paul henderson finds himself turning into the very creature that he's portrayed several times in his career br br overall the pacing and direction were very good as was the most of the performances there were nice gothic touches here and there and an effective score to <UNK> the ambiance this one's a keeper and comes highly recommended
<START> updated january 1st 2006 br br <UNK> is one of my two favorite wagner operas or music dramas to be more accurate <UNK> is the other though it's hard to imagine it as the top of anyone's pops the <UNK> by the composer as usual is a <UNK> of religion <UNK> <UNK> and possibly even <UNK> <UNK> and its length may make it seem to the audience like hearing paint dry br br wagner being a famous anti <UNK> <UNK> may be one of his surrogate jewish villains naturally <UNK> the premiere to an <UNK> not for want of <UNK> trying <UNK> <UNK> who was his favorite conductor go figure <UNK> a most mixed up gal and another likely jewish surrogate is both villainous or <UNK> depending on the scene br br considering that many video versions of <UNK> seem on the <UNK> side this film of the opera is in comparison a breath of fresh air hans <UNK> <UNK> the director has brought considerable imagination to it but it's hard to know why he made some of his choices for example the notorious <UNK> <UNK> of each gender the puppets the death mask of wagner set and various dolls and symbols such as the nazi <UNK> in one of the traveling scenes if i remember the real <UNK> <UNK> wrote the actual music to pad out the scene changes though wagner himself died much too early to be an actual nazi many of his <UNK> as well as his second wife <UNK> were at least fellow <UNK> including their <UNK> <UNK> wagner who still runs the <UNK> festival at an advanced age in fact <UNK> son <UNK> wagner in complete opposition to his father has tried to come to terms honestly with his great grandfather br br <UNK> too seems politically ambiguous from what i've read in 1977 he made a well known film on hitler hitler <UNK> film <UNK> <UNK> sometimes called our hitler in english since it lasts all of 8 hours and hasn't been widely distributed most people have not seen it including myself br br <UNK> jordan the conductor of the audio cd on which this film is based plays <UNK> sung by <UNK> <UNK> edith clever <UNK> <UNK> plays <UNK> michael <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> play the <UNK> <UNK> both sung by <UNK> goldberg and robert lloyd and <UNK> <UNK> both play and sing <UNK> and <UNK> br br though the opera takes place over a long period of time and all except <UNK> have been described as having aged considerably between acts 2 and 3 no one looks a day older by the end of the opera the magic of the grail in this opera the grail is the cup from which jesus <UNK> at the last <UNK> and not mary <UNK> as in more recent times an idea i find preposterous br br the <UNK> and singing are all quite <UNK> and the dvd seems to have improved the sound if not the picture to a great extent yes i agree that <UNK> approach is superior even on the second <UNK> version but he is probably superior to all recorded versions on the whole br br not a <UNK> for all <UNK> but i think it works quite well as a filmed opera
<START> okay so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way but from the beginning hidden frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances and have always been willing to mistakes they've made they advice people to see newer episodes first so they can see just how good the show is and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes the cast have a fantastic <UNK> and it shows on screen br br the <UNK> of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans <UNK> also to the show as the story lines go from strength to strength the show has pushed <UNK> with its various story lines depression drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality and these may have <UNK> a few people the wrong way but that is what star trek is and was all about it portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way dealing with them subtly and smoothly br br yes they have used some characters from trek history but they have done them justice characters like <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> vastly underused in the show had a <UNK> in the new frontier books but they lost their <UNK> after a while when peter david when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci fi and <UNK> shows those characters in a completely different light which serves them better br br the site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and <UNK> and they can get to know the people involved they release <UNK> for every episode so the fans can see what a laugh they have because they are people doing it in their spare time with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide eyed in shock br br what this series now drawing to a close after 7 years has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing bringing people together inspiring others to do the same <UNK> will live for a long time after it ends as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place
<START> this would have to be one of the worst if not the worst movie i've ever nearly seen i couldn't watch it all the way through purely and simply it's gratuitous violence just for the sake of it and the ridiculous story line only adds to the <UNK> and incompetent filming sick and only suitable for those with a love for manic <UNK> after murdering several hundred men women and children seed is finally caught after effortlessly killing several more police officers that finally get a tip as to his <UNK> he's sentenced to death by electric chair and miraculously survives buried alive he <UNK> his way out and plots revenge against those that put him away and <UNK> the switch needless to say more gruesome murders ensue
<START> i only watched this movie because i was so impressed with olivier <UNK> in <UNK> but this is no <UNK> <UNK> had a plot and some likable characters and made sense <UNK> had none of these br br i should have realized that it couldn't possibly be any good after all the always painfully bad michelle forbes had a starring role br br one poster here called the movie incoherent another called it the worst movie ever both gave the movie far too much credit i am so glad i got it from the library for free yet i still feel ripped off br br imdb needs to include a 0 in the rate this film vote just for movies like this one
<START> without mental <UNK> this film which i would like to find in dvd offer an extraordinary diving in the vital and mental context of thought of the people before the <UNK> of the world that there is thirty years a director and a scenario writer could test one such empathy and such a romantic truth to do it of them masterpiece leaves me astounding it would be necessary to be able to see and re examine it film for better <UNK> than the <UNK> and cultural distance us to make lose of capacity to be included understood analyze and finally to accept of such or such example of primitive thought because this thought maintaining almost impossible to feel in the <UNK> world however contain certain keys of our behavior that only them future generations will be able to analyze with sufficient relevance if somebody knows where i then to get a <UNK> copy or vhs to me or <UNK> thank you in advance
<START> almost a two person play and as such the dialog and the performances of the leads will be important neither are particularly good this might have been stronger in fact if it had first been crafted as a two person play and then worked into a film br br anyway a <UNK> vampire who seems slightly <UNK> becomes <UNK> with a stripper as a result of watching too much porn in his crappy home he wants to have her tell him about the daylight he would have been better off finding someone with a day job or someone who excels at painting a picture with words like a poet but then they might not have a hot <UNK> br br after he gets her to do whatever he wants and he's not terribly good at it he <UNK> to feed on her at 6 am at which point the sun rises much is made of that <UNK> despite the fact that he also says that he can go without feeding it will just make him <UNK> additionally he claims he can't let the stripper go since she knows about him but he lets a number of other people go who learn what he is there are a lot of inconsistencies br br why this vampire chooses to live in a house so poorly <UNK> up that light from <UNK> and <UNK> buildings <UNK> in as if it were daytime i'm not sure with all the time in the world you'd think he'd have done a better job or fixed the place up a bit he's clearly not a wealthy vampire br br this is supposedly a remake and i'm curious to see the original version of this dance of the damned although that was directed by <UNK> <UNK> and the other films she directed for corman stripped to kill <UNK> ii were pretty bad
<START> possible spoilers this movie's reputation <UNK> it so it was with anticipation that i sat down to watch it in <UNK> on tcm what a major disappointment br br the cast is superb and the production values are first rate but the characters are without depth the plot is thin and the whole thing goes on too long for a movie that deals with alcoholism family <UNK> <UNK> gambling and sexual <UNK> the movie is curiously flat <UNK> lifeless and cliche ridden one example is the portrayal of frank <UNK> <UNK> his rather heavy handed request to his wife to go upstairs and relax a bit followed by her predictable <UNK> of a headache leads even more predictably to his evening <UNK> with his secretary hey nancy i've got the blues tonight let's go for a drive all according to well worn formula we don't feel these are real people but cardboard <UNK> acting in a <UNK> play also the source of the obvious <UNK> between frank and dave <UNK> is never really explored or explained <UNK> <UNK> with the on again off again <UNK> is inexplicable in light of her <UNK> inability to <UNK> or get off the pot his subsequent marriage of desperation to the shirley <UNK> <UNK> character is from the moment of its being presented to this viewer anyway obviously doomed to fail and it was clear by the conventions of this type of soap opera that it could only be resolved by someone being killed the moment the jealous lover started running around with the gun i started a bet with myself as to who dave or <UNK> would get killed the whole thing was phony with a capital <UNK> br br having said that <UNK> performance and that of dean martin are the <UNK> here but on the whole i find the movie's interest to be purely that of a period piece of hollywood history
<START> <UNK> voiced by <UNK> <UNK> along with his <UNK> friend iq voiced by philip <UNK> and the always hungry <UNK> david gore are kids with big dreams they want to be the first flies in space and what encourages their dreams is the first <UNK> to land on the moon the apollo 11 is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out br br the first thing you notice is the animation of the film i found it done very well done the scenery had depth to it as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes i didn't see the movie in 3 d as it was broadcast on hbo however i could see that there really wasn't any scenes which took advantage of the 3 d effects except a fight between characters near the end i also wasn't really impressed with the design of the characters to me they didn't look like anything resembling a fly especially in the <UNK> the flies were an unusual blue gray that was kind of distracting to me br br the performances from the cast was not bad but it wasn't good either there were many times i focused more on my computer than the story the writing was certainly written for a younger audience with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh i saw nothing for adults like jokes that they'll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning br br history was not followed in this film in fact i think it was completely ignored as the main focus was the flies i also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction and no flies were on apollo 11 i did like how he <UNK> the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though br br if you are an adult this is not for you it was not made for the entire family this is certainly just for kids but save this one for a rainy day
<START> rented and watched this short 90 minutes work it's by far the best treatment modesty has received on film and her creator peter <UNK> agrees <UNK> as a creative <UNK> the character and we who love her are handled with respect <UNK> direction is the best he's done to date and the casting was very well done alexandra <UNK> is almost physically perfect as a match to the original jim <UNK> <UNK> of modesty a terrific find by whoever cast her raymond <UNK> as a young <UNK> garcia was also excellent i hope that tarantino co will go on to make more in the series i'm especially interested to see whom they'd choose to be the <UNK> willie <UNK>
<START> great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced <UNK> gives the concept of the <UNK> <UNK> police detective a whole new dimension of intensity and most importantly credibility br br when a typical hollywood cop <UNK> loses family friends and pets to murder he is usually given his minute of grief but when the sixty seconds are over he pulls himself together packs his gun and goes <UNK> shooting up his enemies one by one br br <UNK> marc <UNK> however is really <UNK> by his girlfriends murder of course but also by finding out that she had another lover in his confusion and wrath he does not seek revenge but needs to keep going to find the real <UNK> of a crime where his <UNK> are all over the scene thus all his actions become <UNK> logical this is the main reason why this movie <UNK> us to our seats but <UNK> not the only one
<START> this waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film nothing new or original is added other than <UNK> <UNK> which are of <UNK> interest it lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective also painfully missing is the sharp <UNK> jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film i can't understand any high ratings for this at all it's quite bad why does anyone waste time or money making crap like this and why did i waste time watching it
<START> the comic banter between william powell and jean arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30's and arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny <UNK> <UNK> they are extremely fun to watch so take the <UNK> of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold eric <UNK> also has some comic turns as <UNK> butler br br <UNK> contract with mgm included a <UNK> which allowed him to reject being <UNK> out to another studio but he wanted to work again with arthur and he liked the script so he eagerly accepted the assignment they had worked together in two <UNK> paramount films the <UNK> murder case and the greene murder case both in the philo vance series
<START> tim robbins and john cusack are two actors i have appreciated throughout their careers and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie well all i can say is i totally <UNK> it these two great actors <UNK> themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant unimaginative and <UNK> to the extreme not that this is bad on its own sketches that are supposed to make people laugh but fail to do so the only reason i can think is that the director was their friend and they decided to support his movie by starring in it i can't think of anything else because this movie is so cheap fortunately tim robbins and john cusack haven't disappointed me ever since i would recommend you to avoid this film unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled
<START> the man in the moon is a pretty good movie it is very touching at times and is very well done in all respects i wouldn't say the film was terribly original but what is these days br br the cast members all did a great job with their respective roles i really enjoyed seeing reese <UNK> at such a young age and does quite a good job jason london does a fine job as well and the only other person i recognized was sam <UNK> who did a fantastic job with his role i really liked <UNK> character matthew <UNK> a lot at times he seemed to be the kind of father you dread but in the end you really like his character the rest of the cast was very good as well br br if you're into touching movies about growing up and dealing with what life throws at you then you ought to watch this film i'd suggest reading the plot synopsis and if that sounds like something you'd be interested in then go for it anyhow hope you enjoy the film thanks for reading br br chris
<START> this is an extremely boring film if you grew up during the vietnam was as i did then you've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now but what really makes this film boring is the narration by director <UNK> <UNK> the majority of the film is shot with <UNK> talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this <UNK> time in the history of our nation br br if you're old enough to remember vietnam then you won't find anything new here there is no new evidence to <UNK> john <UNK> or new evidence worthy of another documentary on vietnam younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see george <UNK> excellent film going <UNK> stolen honor was clearly meant to be a <UNK> job on john <UNK> but it fails miserably at <UNK> that goal
<START> i am frankly surprised how little has been done in film on the <UNK> massacre there isn't a major documentary very puzzling fortunately we are <UNK> with the talent of ben <UNK> who directed zero day and gus van <UNK> who did the equally fine elephant two different takes on the event which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery that there's something ultimately <UNK> and <UNK> about the motivations of the two killers and what actually drove them to carry it beyond fantasy into horrible reality zero day <UNK> made up of <UNK> made by the <UNK> and found after the event is absolutely riveting even if you know where it's going you still harbor hope that it won't go there and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is excruciating the film is terrific from top to bottom from director to script not much improvised though it appears very spontaneous to the two lead actors and the supporting players as well there is only one aspect of zero day that troubled me okay so we can't <UNK> why the <UNK> would do what they did but certainly one of the <UNK> was their anger yet these boys don't really seem angry they may say some things to indicate that they are but in fact they didn't convince me that they had something inside them that compelled them to kill innocent people but this still leaves me with the sense of why that director <UNK> wants me to have anyway rent or buy this movie it will creep up on you and stay with you for a long time the blair witch folks could only wish for the kind of success these guys had at making a mock documentary
<START> really they spelled it brain in the credits not brian br br ok they didn't have the budget for a spell <UNK> all the production money went for great old cars there are at least two <UNK> visible here one is a <UNK> <UNK> a nice yellow <UNK> <UNK> br br the scenes of the movie studio show that there was some money spent for costumes and set <UNK> old cameras an exterior of <UNK> street signs and whatever was needed to make a visually pleasing picture was there poorly written and directed br br my dvd says it runs for <UNK> minutes approximately it was more like 85 minutes it came to an end without reaching a conclusion there was a <UNK> but no conclusion the movie just <UNK> up against the credits 99 cents for this i paid 99 cents for this i could have bought 3 <UNK> of cat food and watched my <UNK> face as he <UNK> more excitement br br for a few seconds in the <UNK> scene after darren <UNK> gets a phone call it looked like maybe this movie would have a surprise twist that would make for an interesting film then it just sat there br br the young latin actor played by steven bauer tony <UNK> could have had a much bigger part in all that was going on here this cast could have made a good film br br i think if they cut <UNK> part and use steven bauer in his place and change the script and keep the <UNK> and lose the band and add a johnny <UNK> sound alike band then they got something br br here kitty kitty br br tom <UNK>
<START> i am a fan of animal movies if you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over <UNK> bound did just this they took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it it was a complete success it is very much an <UNK> movie you have the <UNK> wan of the group shadow who is wise and logical you have the lovable but <UNK> and <UNK> chance and the <UNK> princess who thinks that she should be <UNK> and praised these three personalities <UNK> off of each other very well i also like how they made chance and sassy such dynamic characters and they did not <UNK> it most people say that it cannot be good because it is too much of a kids film what they are forgetting however is that it is supposed to be a kids film and this still does not take away from the <UNK> movie this is a good movie to watch when you are bored and you just want to watch a movie it is a disney movie without the cartoons an air bud movie with a better plot i would without a doubt advise you to watch it
<START> paul jason lee is an <UNK> who just happens to be engaged to a type a princess named karen <UNK> blair she chooses his clothes and his daily schedule at his bachelor party paul gets a little too drunk and somehow ends up taking a pretty dancer named <UNK> julia stiles back to his <UNK> nothing happened as they say but the duo do wake up in the same bed suddenly karen <UNK> she's on her way to paul's apartment understandably paul <UNK> <UNK> out of the place although her <UNK> are left behind but there is even more fun ahead at a family dinner at <UNK> parents' home paul runs <UNK> into <UNK> again learning that she is <UNK> cousin talk about some explaining to do but instead paul chooses to <UNK> a stomach problem and hides out in the bathroom will karen ever find out that <UNK> spent the night at paul's place and what will be the consequences i'm sorry for critics who pan movies like this they should definitely <UNK> up for this film is fresh and fun of course it doesn't hurt matters that lee is a <UNK> funny man stiles is a charming beauty or that blair is a natural as a pretty but <UNK> fiancée the rest of the cast including james <UNK> and julie <UNK> is also quite nice the look of the film is wonderful as are the costumes and california settings best of all the script is imaginative and inspired creating big laughs for the audience in short if you want to <UNK> the proverbial <UNK> get this movie tonight it may not be academy award material but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a darn good one
<START> baseketball is an extremely funny movie that delivers acting that generally makes the movie alot funnier comedy material that is more than crap in your pants funny and a pretty good plot despite the fact that its the classic <UNK> v s the evil rich guy the one and only thing i didnt like about baseketball was that that kid <UNK> really needed in the movie but if the kid <UNK> in the movie some of the funny scenes <UNK> have existed if you have read any pro reviews about this movie <UNK> them all because basically all the reviewers didnt like this film baseketball is a great comedy that gives everyone what they want 8 out of 10
<START> i saw this <UNK> pile of vignettes tonight at a preview screening and i was straight up blown away by how bad it was br br first off the film practically <UNK> its <UNK> blind spots there are no black or gay new <UNK> in love or who say know the self involved white people in love i know it's not the love crash of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> but you can't pretend to have a cinematic new york with out these fairly prevalent members of society plus you know the people who produced this ish thought crash deserved that ham handed oscar so where is everyone br br possibly worse than the bizarre and <UNK> <UNK> ignorance were the down right offensive chapters remember when you were in high school and people were openly disgusted with pretty young women in <UNK> me either this movie ran the gamut of ways to be the worst bad acting bad writing bad directing all <UNK> every possible genre ever to concern wealthy white people who smoke <UNK> outside fancy <UNK> br br but thank god they finally got <UNK> hayden christensen and rachel <UNK> back together for that <UNK> reunion and side note uma <UNK> a bullet ethan hawke looks <UNK> this of course is one thing in terms of his looks but added an incredibly creepy extra vibe of <UNK> to his <UNK> scripted scene opposite poor lovely maggie q br br i had a terrible time choosing my least favorite scene for the end of film <UNK> but it has to be the anton <UNK> olivia <UNK> bit for the sheer lack of taste which <UNK> me because i really like those two actors i don't consider myself easily offended but all i could do was <UNK> and look around with disgust like someone's 50 year old aunt br br a close second place in this incredibly tight contest of terrible things is <UNK> <UNK> tone deaf portrayal of what it means for a former disney channel star to act against julie christie i don't mean opposite i mean against against is the only explanation i realize now that the early sequence with orlando bloom is a relative highlight highlight please keep that in mind when your brain begins to <UNK> out your ear soon after the opening credits which seem to be a nod to the first new york real world this film is embarrassing strangely dated <UNK> <UNK> pretentious and in the end completely divorced from any real idea of new york at all br br the extra star is for the <UNK> <UNK> eli <UNK> sequence as it is actually quite sweet but it is only one bright spot in what feels like hours of pointless <UNK> torment
<START> although in some aspects seven pounds is solid and interesting in some of its narrative style <UNK> <UNK> project is rather mediocre the movie becomes more and more sappy and manipulative as it move toward the end hearts human and emotional eyes physical and <UNK> seven pounds is more of an amateurish imitation of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and 21 <UNK> with lots and lots of flashbacks the problem is the story is quite predictable from very easily on through the movie that's too bad because seven pounds could have been as <UNK> good if ben and emily had been put in the right hands
<START> this one tends to get <UNK> by a lot of critics and kurosawa fans but i thought it was wonderful it's an episodic multi character study of <UNK> <UNK> who live in a city literally made from garbage though it looks like an a bomb just hit the film has a sort of <UNK> beauty thanks to the glorious use of technicolor the title comes from the sound made by the insane young man who drives an imaginary <UNK> through the <UNK> all the characters were wonderful and all the stories engrossing but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car when not searching for food they spend their spare time using their imagination to build their dream house an emotionally moving and beautiful film
<START> if you like the standard sly flicks that involve over the top action unbelievable stunts unbelievable is not intended to be <UNK> here and retarded dialogue you will love this steaming pile of mountain goat dung i had high hopes based on the trailer i thought that <UNK> was going to be forced in his has been days to <UNK> to smarter people and make an action film that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story setting and believable action would <UNK> i <UNK> action that is at least close enough to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event my limited knowledge of <UNK> and its effects rendered at least one scene laughably ridiculous judge <UNK> is only better because you know going into the theater that you are going to see a comic book made into a movie the character setting and everything else are beyond comparison to anything we might encounter ourselves cliffhanger on the other hand turns a mountain climbing guide into rambo before you can say <UNK> adrian
<START> <UNK> life the view from here is an absolutely stunning movie about aids as well as about a gay love relationship some images are indeed really hard to take especially when one is gay or fears about aids and probably for any sensitive person watching it it's not easy to make a movie about such a terrible illness and its consequences about not only one but two people's lives this movie teaches how to care for each other in such hard times but it never gets too morbid it still shows life at any time reminding you that outside of the theater or of your room life goes on whatever the destiny of some people may be the characters are incredibly endearing while we watch their <UNK> in shots that never go beyond a very strict limit never <UNK> anything too private or offensive children should certainly not watch this movie but grown ups whether they have to deal with such situations or not should do it and will not regret the tears they shed
<START> spike lee has to be one of the most over rated directors i have ever seen he is the <UNK> darling because he supposedly makes films with a message or he is just so <UNK> in his approach that it makes critics that are <UNK> from formula hollywood films eat his stuff up just for being different br br summer of sam does not even do that well the cinematography and editing style is oliver stone and so is the narrative the plot is a lot like do the right thing the portrayal of <UNK> or for the pc set italian americans of which i happen to be one is straight out of eddie murphy's raw only eddie murphy's impression of a macho italian guy picking a fight with a much <UNK> african american is much much more believable than the cartoonish broad italian caricatures shown here the john <UNK> character being a possible exception br br is there anybody who saw this movie that could not figure out how it was going to end up as soon as <UNK> came into the film i could already see the fist in his face and the foot in his stomach i could already see him being accused of being the killer this character had the most integrity in the whole film so of course lee is going to show what happens to people that stand out in a crowd what a white <UNK> <UNK> br br someone please please give spike lee a lifetime pass to all the basketball games he wants so maybe he will be enjoying himself too much to pick up a film camera for a long time and we won't have to be subjected to his self important drivel and furthermore i won't have to see critics some of them whom i respect <UNK> and <UNK> to an emperor with no clothes
<START> i had never heard of this one before it turned up on cable tv it's very typical of late 50s sci fi sober depressing and not a little paranoid despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is <UNK> possibly for what is <UNK> an extremely low budget venture while not uninteresting in itself the apocalypse via <UNK> missile angle later <UNK> with far greater <UNK> for both dr <UNK> 1964 and fail safe 1964 and mercifully short the film's single minded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter particularly in the scenes involving an <UNK> <UNK> and a gang of clueless juvenile <UNK>
<START> we've all seen this story a hundred times you can see each plot turn coming a mile away the relationship between the mother and daughter is way too sweet and understanding to pass for realistic janet <UNK> performance is stock southern hot ticket mother in vintage clothes should have been made for the lifetime channel
<START> this <UNK> musical has more than a <UNK> of <UNK> from it's star the musical genius that is prince the film is 90 or so minutes of posing but in truth it is easy to see why it is such a cult classic br br much like other films that centre around the struggling young musician trying to be big this has a hint of drama in it to add a dimension to the musical numbers while this film isn't as good as 8 mile as a recent example this is entertaining none the less and the soundtrack is much better on the dramatic side of things the story <UNK> around the kid prince a young artist and regular spot at a club the owner of the club is frustrated with the kid's arrogance and little does the kid know that he could soon be fired and replaced by a rival one the side the kid's parents are having trouble with his dad <UNK> her violently during the course of the film the kid learns a few lessons in life and learns to appreciate his friends more it's all stuff we have seen in coming of age dramas of course but this is combined as a musical a very <UNK> musical br br the cast are good prince is actually quite good on the drama side when he's not striking a pose he seems human and <UNK> clarence williams is very good as the abusive father as well <UNK> <UNK> makes a good debut as <UNK> sexy love interest br br the main strength of the movie however is the superb soundtrack the musical numbers are well staged and <UNK> prince is no doubt a musical <UNK> albeit very eccentric when he is inspired he is great but on the flip side he will often do songs that are solely for his own taste and occasionally his <UNK> can miss fire but that is the same for many musical geniuses the soundtrack for this film is excellent though with only <UNK> being a weak point the show stopping performance of purple rain is the standout though it is one of my all time favourite songs br br
<START> i would love to comment on this film alas my search has always <UNK> in vain if any good citizen could help a desperate <UNK> of this <UNK> planet and <UNK> his confidence in humanity by offering the <UNK> of either a uk vhs or <UNK> him a dvd copy of the vhs he would without <UNK> be <UNK> grateful br br blake wrote the road to excess is the path to wisdom one hopes my weary road of excess will offer the path to <UNK> if not i will have to replay the excellent mr <UNK> gothic in the knowledge that those who have seen haunted summer for better or for worse have <UNK> their viewing pleasure of the events of july <UNK> whilst i a fellow member of this <UNK> plot rests his lonely case in <UNK>
<START> this is a genuinely horrible film the plot such as it is is totally <UNK> i think it has something to do with blackmail but i'm not entirely certain br br half of the dialogue consists of useless cliches the other half is spoken by the various actors in such <UNK> <UNK> of southern accents that thankfully the words cannot be recognized br br but the one true tragedy of the movie is that such a historic talent as mary tyler moore apparently was in such dire financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it br br
<START> far <UNK> in <UNK> and character than even the classics from the 30's and 50's george c scott was born to be scrooge just as he was born to be <UNK> mr scott will be known as one of the greatest actors of the 20th century the character of scrooge as played by mr scott seemed to jump off the screen scott as scrooge brought an <UNK> more <UNK> yet a more deeply moving scrooge to the screen than any of his predecessors in the role of the <UNK> man in 18th century london mr scott seemed to bring scrooge to a more personal understandable yet highly conflicted level his role was acted with the great authority scott always bring to the screen yet his usual <UNK> voice would sometimes be brought to a <UNK> almost as a <UNK> as he would <UNK> the christmas holiday in one breath yet reveal his own human <UNK> in his next line he could portray the sour and <UNK> scrooge and a misunderstood sympathetic scrooge all in the same scene br br truly a remarkable performance by a giant of his generation
<START> i knew about but had never seen grey gardens before i saw the broadway musical of the same name friends <UNK> me that if i had not seen the movie the musical would not make sense it did but it also <UNK> me to rent the movie at first i thought it was a train wreck full of strange <UNK> characters and it was exceedingly hard to watch but being able to stop it <UNK> it and go back to it made me realize why grey gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary br br both big edie and little edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self consciousness is worth witnessing both of them remain beautiful despite their <UNK> age they have a relationship that will chill any woman and undoubtedly some men and make you re examine your own <UNK> with your mother in an era when reality television and cinema is <UNK> it's fascinating to see the <UNK> work from three decades ago and realize what an impact the film must have had br br i echo what other posters have said how were they allowed to slip into such <UNK> by their family but beyond that how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped i would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track which gave me additional insight into the film
<START> after watching this i thought to myself there are either too few good writers directors or lots of producers br br at any rate this is a terrible movie terrible in a way that it's not fun but rather makes you <UNK> your teeth and <UNK> makes you shout this is wrong at the movie <UNK> is zero by now most of you are probably used to the terrible errors weirdness <UNK> in movies that has computers <UNK> etc in them this movie is like that in every aspect br br the only good thing about the movie is the little girl emily brilliantly played by <UNK> bennett i hope she becomes big and make this thing at least worth something br br do yourself a favor don't watch this there is not even proper action in it total waste of time
<START> i think everyone was quite disappointed with this sci fi flick for one thing it was directed by tim burton another thing it's a remake of what is supposed to be a classic i found it boring gross and ridiculous if you've seen it you know what i mean just about everyone at imdb say it's crap and boy are they right if you haven't avoid it it's a <UNK> 1 out of 10
<START> wow this was a very bad movie as read in other comments this movie has no plot no character development they possibly had some kind of script but it's difficult to tell based on the actual end result br br the editing of this movie was really non existent it tends to jump from scene to scene without any connection or anything to assist the viewer in <UNK> what is actually happening br br all in all this is simply a low budget zombie flick that was not thought out at all has bad acting bad dialogue bad everything br br the only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or 2 is the gore factor i think this must be where they spent whatever money they had to try to justify making this br br unless you are like me dedicated to finding and watching all the zombie flicks you can find do not watch this period
<START> <UNK> doesn't a big stack of <UNK> sound good <UNK> <UNK> and fruit <UNK> on top take a bite <UNK> take another bite another another eat eat it you keep <UNK> it down your throat until your face turns green with <UNK> you have just had the ally <UNK> experience br br i stumbled on this show in the winter of <UNK> and was instantly hooked like that stack of <UNK> i <UNK> myself on it but the enjoyment soon wore off because the ally <UNK> character whom we see to be cute endearing at first sight soon becomes the most annoying insecure whining <UNK> you've ever met call me a feminist but i prefer my female leads to have a spine the gags gimmicks of the show also become hackneyed the music of <UNK> shepherd which is really shoved in your face becomes grating and the <UNK> character changes <UNK> make the show into a damn soap opera br br my advice to you is to take this show in small doses and quit as soon as it becomes <UNK> and it will i made it through 2 5 seasons before my enjoyment had totally <UNK> it was good while it lasted but like a crazy neurotic ex girlfriend it just turned ugly after it had <UNK> its welcome br br and next time you go to <UNK> skip the <UNK> order something healthy like the fruit cup it'll sit with you much better
<START> this must have been an embarrassment to every member of the entirely african american cast every <UNK> <UNK> stereotype of the black american community is featured <UNK> i won't <UNK> the insults by listing them here except to mention <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> br br one good song by <UNK> waters and a couple of bad ones and the fantastic singing and dancing talents of 8 year old sammy davis bring the total up to something below 1 on the imdb scale
<START> like <UNK> and king of comedy other great misunderstood comedies envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially losers may be too harsh a word i will call them suburban under <UNK> br br this film was a dark comedy gem and i'm not sure what people expect i <UNK> seeing a major studio comedy that isn't filled with obvious humor and i believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile the look on <UNK> face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves yes it was a fairly simple story but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way there were a lot of great scenes the j man's <UNK> cabin by the lake <UNK> <UNK> burial <UNK> wife role and <UNK> j man all great stuff br br i can't stand people that get on imdb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one i will take envy over almost any of the top ten <UNK> comedies of the year save <UNK> dynamite it's <UNK> <UNK> and an offbeat enjoyable gem br br remember this people most times popular doesn't equal good
<START> i was delighted to finally see the release of amazing stories the first season on dvd i had forgotten just what a stellar cast of actors and directors worked on this series for the longest time the only way you got to see this remarkable series was with the vhs 2 or 3 episode <UNK> or when sci fi would re run the episodes however when sci fi would host the re runs they generally stuck to the same episodes there were a few outstanding episodes in season one like the mission that they didn't repeat does anyone know exactly how long this series ran it says 1985 to 1987 at the top here at imdb but i thought it ran longer than two years if you loved the twilight zone night gallery and outer limits you will love this series and you will not be disappointed with your purchase
<START> this <UNK> horror flick has vincent price playing a mad magician that realizes his <UNK> talents have been sold to another he <UNK> ways of <UNK> all those that have <UNK> him his master scheme seems to back fire on him br br price is a little below par compared to his masterpieces but is still the only reason to watch this thriller supporting cast includes patrick <UNK> mary murphy eva <UNK> and jay <UNK> br br
<START> it all begins with a series of <UNK> of seemingly unrelated objects in a hostel for students on <UNK> road london concerned for her sister who is the <UNK> there miss <UNK> asks <UNK> <UNK> to look into the matter he agrees but soon the stakes get higher when a girl who had admitted that she was responsible for most not all of the <UNK> is found murdered br br <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is a solid brain exercise without being as mind numbingly complicated as one two <UNK> my shoe murder <UNK> and diamond <UNK> are the crimes involved and the final twist that ties everything together is revealed only in the last 2 minutes the characters are interesting particularly the psychology student colin <UNK> and the mysterious american girl sally <UNK> inspector <UNK> has his funny moments in perhaps the closest this series has come to toilet humor and miss <UNK> gets a more integral part to the story than usual
<START> this is an exquisite film about the search for some bliss in everyday life the pacing the camera work the emotion the haunting musical score and the pure charm of this picture make it a must see it isn't easily appreciated by the immature or emotionally <UNK> the only flaw i can see about this film is that it wasn't captured in a more technically perfect film format it deserved todd <UNK> technicolor and the very finest sound format available an intimate film can be made in <UNK> <UNK> the gorgeous italian <UNK> effect on its inhabitants would have rendered even more <UNK> and the small lovely moments would be even more beautifully seen and heard as it is it still demands attention as a sweet moving small film i can't stop myself from watching it every time it comes on <UNK> the <UNK> of the characters from contained tight and <UNK> is always a joy to watch and i really should recommend it more often br br the casting is perfect the mood is perfect the acting is above <UNK> it is a film about middle age and the choices people make it is deep and thoughtful without beating the viewer up with heavy <UNK> watch it in one sitting and let it have its effect on you if you don't get it perhaps you haven't lived enough or something else is wrong with you
<START> after chaplin made one of his best films <UNK> dynamite he made one of his worst gentlemen of nerve during this first year in films chaplin made about a third of all his films many of them were experimental in terms of ad <UNK> editing gags location shooting etc this one takes place at a <UNK> where chaplin and his friend try to get in without paying mabel <UNK> is there with her friend also and chaplin manages to rid himself of both his and <UNK> friends he then <UNK> mabel in the <UNK> with no apparent <UNK> from his behavior lots of slapstick in here but there is very little else to recommend this film for other then watching chaplin develop the print i saw was badly <UNK> which may have affected its enjoyment <UNK> chase can be <UNK> of 4 stars
<START> i guess that this movie is based on some kind of a true story it's about two young girls who <UNK> a grown man for <UNK> i don't see where the terror comes into play here there are some <UNK> and surreal sequences in the movie and the two girls sandra locke and ah oh well play the roll of two psycho man <UNK> to the <UNK> they do a pretty good job although some of it is just a tad over the top the movie's not good and it's not horrible it's just really really dated i mean this thing is dripping with the 70's it's not really bad if you like that sort of thing you know that <UNK>
<START> excellent political thriller played much <UNK> and slower than other higher <UNK> films in this genre when people talk about pacino and cusack how do they manage to skip over these amazing career <UNK> performances a story of friendships father son relationships corruption and <UNK> the two actors <UNK> amazingly well together and the supports from aiello and fonda are equally as impressive although aiello is brilliant especially when the papers run to press instead of <UNK> on an over complex corruption scandal it creates wonderful characters who show the human side of failure an political <UNK> the final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and acted
<START> <UNK> <UNK> can be safely included in the <UNK> of one of the worst ever films made by mankind the film one of the many handicapped people flicks that <UNK> after the phenomenal success of black is makes a mockery of the handicapped <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> khan are mere caricatures of handicapped people while black portrayed the <UNK> and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world <UNK> <UNK> shows two <UNK> like monkeys who have no <UNK> about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests <UNK> <UNK> music is fair enough <UNK> <UNK> who made a promising start with <UNK> is sadly losing his balls quickly in hindi cinema <UNK> khan was never an acceptable actor and deserves to be banned from the film industry amrita <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> are just pretty <UNK> in distress having nightmarish times in <UNK> with no one to save them except for the <UNK> mentioned <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> as the villainous don toni is somewhat acceptable avoid the film if possible
<START> only one thing could have redeemed this sketch a healthy <UNK> between the happy couple the exotic model at the <UNK> and the old <UNK> from the motel who was it would have turned out secretly watching from the woods and had been aging rent boy to the guys when they'd shared the rubber house br br in the process they could have blown that <UNK> shack to <UNK> resolved most of the <UNK> such as the whore bitch <UNK> on the <UNK> the reason why the protagonist had no friends as well as explaining his <UNK> under pressure from bloody <UNK> <UNK> phone calls and that crawl space <UNK> the green thumb and his attraction to the simpler life quite the <UNK> with the human body though ex <UNK> <UNK> attendant a bit of a <UNK> would have been nice br br it was fun watching these people move around i guess but <UNK> silly italian games were <UNK> stereotypical while the caretaker had been to too many <UNK> classes a dick a mind and a pick up truck about summed it up for him i also wished they could have had a bit more <UNK> <UNK> is ready to go after putting some black underwear into her nifty red <UNK> and the caretaker just needs a cardboard <UNK> there at the motel br br <UNK> matters you may well say i agree although the <UNK> bits just didn't add up right in this rush job good owl <UNK> though and i really felt cold all the way through
<START> ok i bought this film from <UNK> for my friend for a joke present on his birthday because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it br br but we decided it to watch it anyway just for hilarity purposes br br and i'm sorry but this has got to be one of the worst films in history br br it began off alright and we thought ok this might actually be ok but after about 10 minutes we were sadly mistaken br br it began when the mysterious paint <UNK> turned out to be the most obvious character the <UNK> australian i say that because he had an accent which couldn't be identified who's acting might i just say was abysmal br br then it got to the end and by that time we had all lost the will to live the paint ball <UNK> br br the only thing i did like about this plot is that they didn't actually win but annoyingly enough they won by <UNK> br br and i know this has nothing to do with it but the name the team were given was just awful critical damage i mean they could of picked a more awesome name like the <UNK> of the anti christ or something or that's what the film should of been called anyway

<START> not sure why it doesn't play in <UNK> apparently but this is a very funny clever british comedy it's set at the end of the swinging sixties peter <UNK> is fantastic as the rich forty something serial <UNK> the perfectly <UNK> goldie hawn playing a 19 year american girl in london is initially <UNK> catch of the day but the <UNK> tv food critic can't stop himself from falling for the <UNK> american blond br br humour pathos great script strong performances from the leads and supporting <UNK> br br it's a great film and the best gag is the very last line br br try it you'll like it
